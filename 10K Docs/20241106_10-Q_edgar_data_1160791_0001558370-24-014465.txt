 THIRD QUARTER 2024 SUMMARY A summary for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is presented below and discussed further under Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations : Don David Gold Mine In the third quarter of 2024, the Don David Gold Mine DDGM in Mexico produced and sold a total of 3,526 gold equivalent AuEq ounces, comprised of 1,357 gold ounces and 181,434 silver ounces at an average sales price per ounce of 2,561 and 30.61, respectively. Beginning in the third quarter, the DDGM underground diamond drilling program progressed positively with two drill rigs in operation. Until the new drill stations are developed to further test the Three Sisters system, the focus of the drilling strategically shifted to infill the northwest extension of the Arista vein system, targeting the Marena North, Santa Cecilia, and Splay 31 veins to further define, expand, and upgrade the Mineral Resources in this area. To preserve cash, the infill drilling was suspended on August 1, 2024. The grade control drilling continued as planned during the third quarter, focusing on maximizing the potential economic returns of the mineralization scheduled for future production in both the Arista and Switchback vein systems. There were no lost time incidents during the quarter, resulting in a zero year-to-date Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate LTIFR safety record. Safety is paramount for the Company. The Company strives to continue its excellent track record each quarter and seeks to improve safety measures, awareness, and training on an ongoing basis. 
 Corporate and Financial Gold Resource Corporation and its subsidiaries we, our, us, or the Company has 6.1 million in working capital and 1.4 million in cash as of September 30, 2024. Net loss was 10.5 million or 0.11 per share for the quarter, which was mainly attributable to the decrease in net sales because the Company s production was significantly impacted by the lack of availability of critical mining equipment and the lack of multiple faces to mine, in addition to the unfavorable weather conditions impacting the mining and processing operations . Total cash cost after co-product credits for the quarter was 3,560 per AuEq ounce, and total all-in sustaining cost AISC after co-product credits for the quarter was 5,072 per AuEq ounce. (See Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-GAAP Measures for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to applicable GAAP measures). 
 Liquidity Update Tonnes and grade, with respect to the Company s mining operations at DDGM, have declined during 2024 and are below budget, especially in the third quarter. There are several factors that caused these declines. The Company has encountered significant issues with equipment availability due to the age and condition of some of the critical mining equipment in use at the mine. Due to the continued challenges with equipment availability and the decreased cash due to prior production shortfalls, the Company has not been able to maintain its projected timeline for development of future production zones. As a result, the Company is currently mining only one face at a time in areas that are accessible. The current lack of other available production zones has placed additional pressure on the Company s ability to achieve its production estimates, as any problems encountered at the current production zone cannot be offset by producing elsewhere in the mine. In addition, the mill also experienced some mechanical issues and wet ore handling difficulties due to unusually high rain fall that resulted in lower throughput and a production shortfall. To minimize the mechanical issues and return the mine to a cash positive position, capital is necessary to replace some of the mining fleet and upgrade the mill. The Company believes that the mine has significant potential to generate positive cash flow based on the information to date from the new areas of the Three Sisters as well as other areas that have been discovered near the existing mining zones. In order to develop access and better define these new areas, an investment must be made 

 Gold Resource Corporation Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Notes (Unaudited) 3 

Table of Contents 
 in the equipment and mine plan. Without the addition of these areas to the life-of-mine plan, the Company does not believe that the mine will generate sufficient free cash flow in the near term. The Company s inability to achieve its production estimates has created substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company currently anticipates that it will require approximately 7 million to obtain additional mining equipment and mill upgrades. These amounts include approximately 2.5 million in upgrades at the mill, including approximately 1.0 million to install a new filter to increase capacity in the filter plant and approximately 0.7 million to obtain a spare ball gear. These investments also include approximately 4.5 million in mining equipment to replace old or inefficient equipment, including underground loaders, bolters, and drills. The Company also expects to require approximately 8 million in working capital in order to fund the initial development to access the Three Sisters and Splay 31 systems, although not all of this capital will be required immediately. Due to the 2024 production challenges described above, the Company does not believe that the mine will generate sufficient cashflow to fund these improvements. The Company is evaluating various financing options in order to fund this development in the near term. If the Company is unable to obtain this additional capital and successfully develop these new mining areas, the continued operation of the mine may not be possible beyond November 2024. If continued operation of the mine is not possible, the Company may be compelled to place the mine on care and maintenance status, which would likely trigger significant severance and other costs which the Company may not be able to pay.

 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the cash and cash equivalents balance of million as of September 30, 2024. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management is presently seeking financing to raise cash to provide for working capital. Failure to raise some form of long-term debt arrangement or additional equity capital will cause the Company to further reduce its working capital, and the Company may be compelled to place the mine on care and maintenance status and cease operations until sufficient capital is available. Additionally, even if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenue will be sufficient to enable it to achieve a level where it will generate profits and positive cash flows from operations.

 million and an income tax expense of million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of million and million, respectively. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, the interim provision for taxes is calculated using the estimated consolidated annual effective tax rate. The consolidated effective tax rate is a function of the combined effective tax rates for the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Variations in the relative proportions of jurisdictional income could result in fluctuations to the Company s consolidated effective tax rate. At the federal level, the Company s income in the U.S. is taxed at , and a withholding tax applies to dividends received from Mexico. Income in Mexico is taxed at income tax and mining tax), and Canada s income is taxed at , which results in a consolidated effective tax rate above statutory U.S. Federal rates. The U.S. and certain Canadian jurisdictions do not currently generate taxable income. Mexico Valuation Allowance The Company recorded a valuation allowance on the Mexico Income Tax net deferred tax assets in 2024 for million. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, after considering all available evidence, both positive and negative. The Company determined a valuation allowance on Mexico Income Tax deferred tax assets was necessary due primarily to the recent losses at the Mexico mine. Mexico Mining Taxation Mining entities in Mexico are subject to two mining duties, in addition to the Mexico corporate income tax: (i) a special mining duty of of taxable income as defined under Mexican tax law (also referred to as mining royalty tax on extraction activities performed by concession holders, and (ii) the extraordinary mining duty of on gross revenue from the sale of gold, silver, and platinum. The mining royalty tax generally applies to earnings before income tax, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and interest. In calculating the mining royalty tax, there are no corporate deductions related to depreciable costs from operational fixed assets. However, prospecting and exploration expenses are amortized using a rate in a straight line. Both duties are tax deductible for income tax purposes. As a result, the Company s effective tax rate applicable to the Company s Mexican operations is higher than Mexico s statutory rate. The Company periodically transfers funds from its Mexican wholly owned subsidiary to the U.S. as dividends, which are subject to a Mexico withholding tax, unless otherwise provided per a tax treaty. The current U.S.-Mexico tax treaty limits the dividend withholding tax between these countries to , as long as specific requirements are met. Based on the

 withholding tax on dividends paid from Mexico. The estimated annual effective tax rate reflects the impact of the planned annual transfers for 2024. In October 2023, the Company received a notification from the Mexican Tax Administration Services SAT with a sanction of million pesos (approximately million as of September 30, 2024) as the result of a 2015 tax audit that began in 2021. The 2015 tax audit performed by SAT encompassed various tax aspects, including but not limited to intercompany transactions, mining royalty tax, and extraordinary mining tax. Management is in process of disputing this tax notification and sent a letter of protest to the tax authorities along with providing all requested documentation. Management intends to pursue legal avenues of protest, including filing a lawsuit with the Mexico court system, if necessary, to ensure that these adjustments are removed. Management believes the position taken on the 2015 income tax return meets the more likely than not threshold and that as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has liability for uncertain tax positions. If the Company were to determine there was an unrecognized tax benefit, the Company would recognize the liability and related interest and penalties within income tax (benefit) provision. Prepaid insurance Prepaid income tax Other current assets Total Prepaid income tax Mexican tax statutes specify that the current year tax prepayments be calculated based on a coefficient for prior year earnings, regardless of current year results. Starting in the third quarter of each year, these same statutes allow companies to request a reduction of the coefficient, which adjusts for losses experienced in the current year. During 2023, DDGM had to prepay approximately million pesos million) despite of the losses for the year. In 2024, these overpayments can be used to offset the required 2024 tax prepayments, and as a result, income tax payments are expected in 2024. Other current assets A value added IVA tax in Mexico is assessed on the sales of products and purchases of materials and services. Businesses owe IVA taxes as the business sells a product and collects IVA taxes from its customers. Likewise, businesses are generally entitled to recover the taxes they have paid related to purchases of materials and services, either as a refund or credit to IVA tax payable. Amounts recorded as IVA taxes in the consolidated financial statements represent the net estimated IVA tax payable or receivable, since there is a legal right of offset of IVA taxes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this resulted in an asset balance of million and million, respectively, included in Other current assets.

The increase in the liability of both gold and silver streams as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 is due to higher metal price assumptions applied. The stream agreements contain customary provisions regarding default and security. In the event that the Company defaults under the stream agreements, including by failing to achieve commercial production by an agreed upon date, it may be required to repay the deposit plus accumulated interest at a rate agreed with OBL. If the Company fails to do so, OBL may elect to enforce its remedies as a secured party and take possession of the assets that comprise the Back Forty Project.

 million to Aquila through a gold stream purchase agreement. In June 2020, Aquila amended its agreement with OBL, reducing the total committed amount to million, as well as adjusting certain milestone dates under the gold stream to align with the current project development timeline. Aquila had received a total of million of the committed funds at the time of the Company s acquisition. Remaining deposits from OBL are million upon receipt of permits required for the development and operation of the Back Forty Project and million upon the first drawdown of an appropriate project debt finance facility. OBL has been provided a general security agreement over the Back Forty Project, which consists of the subsidiaries of Gold Resource Acquisition Sub. Inc., a owned subsidiary of the Company. The initial term of the agreement is for , automatically renewable for successive periods. The agreement is subject to certain operating and financial covenants, which are in good standing as of September 30, 2024. In March 2024, the Company secured an amendment to the stream agreement that deferred the required completion of certain operational milestones related to permitting from 2024 to 2026. The million received from OBL through September 30, 2024 is shown as a long-term liability on the Condensed Consolidated Interim Balance Sheets , along with an implied interest. The implied interest rate is applied on the OBL advance payments and calculated on the total expected life-of-mine production to be deliverable using an estimated gold price and a discount rate of . As the remaining million deposit is subject to the completion of specific milestones and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, this amount is not reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Interim Balance Sheets. Per the terms of the gold stream agreement, OBL will purchase of the refined gold from Back Forty (the Threshold Stream Percentage until the Company has delivered ounces of gold (the Production Threshold ). Upon satisfaction of the Production Threshold, the Threshold Stream Percentage will be reduced to of the refined gold (the Tail Stream ). In exchange for the refined gold delivered under the Stream Agreement, OBL will pay the Company ongoing payments equal to of the spot price of gold on the day of delivery, subject to a maximum payment of per ounce. Where the market price of gold is greater than the price paid, the difference realized from the sale of the gold will be applied against the deposit received from OBL. Please see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in Item 1 Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Notes (unaudited) for additional information . Silver Stream Agreement Through a series of contracts, Aquila executed a silver stream agreement with OBL to purchase of the silver produced and sold at the Back Forty Project. A total of million has been advanced under the agreement as of September 30, 2024. There are future deposits remaining under the agreement. The initial term of the agreement is for , automatically renewable for successive periods. The agreement is subject to certain operating and financial covenants, which are in good standing as of September 30, 2024. In March 2024, the Company secured an amendment to the stream agreement that deferred the required completion of certain operational milestones related to permitting from 2024 to 2026. Per the terms of the silver stream agreement, OBL will purchase of the silver produced from the Back Forty Project at a fixed price of per ounce of silver.

The Company s undiscounted reclamation liabilities of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are related to DDGM. These represent reclamation liabilities that were expensed through 2013 before proven and probable reserves were established and the Company was considered to be a development stage entity; therefore, most of the costs, including asset retirement costs, were not allowed to be capitalized as part of the Company s property, plant, and mine development.

Contingent Consideration With the Aquila acquisition, the Company assumed a contingent consideration. On December 30, 2013, Aquila s shareholders approved the acquisition of of the shares of HudBay Michigan Inc. HMI ), a subsidiary of HudBay Minerals Inc. HudBay ), effectively giving Aquila ownership in the Back Forty Project (the HMI Acquisition ). Pursuant to the HMI Acquisition, HudBay s interest in the Back Forty Project was acquired in consideration for the issuance of common shares of Aquila, future milestone payments tied to the development of the Back Forty Project and a net smelter return royalty on production from certain land parcels in the project. The issuance of shares and net smelter obligations were settled before the Company acquired Aquila.

 million tied to the development of the Back Forty project as follows: a. C million payable on completion of any form of financing for purposes including the commencement of construction of Back Forty, up to of the C million can be paid, at the Company s option in Gold Resource Corporation shares with the balance payable in cash; b. C million payable in cash 90 days after the commencement of commercial production; c. C million payable in cash 270 days after the commencement of commercial production, and; a. C million payable in cash 450 days after the commencement of commercial production. 
 Initially, the Company intended to pay the first C million in 2023 to prevent HudBay s buy-back option in the Back Forty Project. Management later decided that it was more likely than not that HudBay would not exercise its buy-back option, and consequently, this amount was not paid. Additionally, since financing of the project is not expected in 2024, this liability was reclassified to long-term. As of the end of January 2024, by the contractual deadline, HudBay did not exercise its buy-back option, and thus, it is forfeited. The total value of the contingent consideration as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The contingent consideration is adjusted for the time value of money and the likelihood of the milestone payments. Any future change in the value of the contingent consideration is recognized in other expense, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Interim Statements of Operations .

The Company currently has no basis to conclude that any or all of such contingencies will materially affect its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, in the future, there may be changes to these contingencies, or additional contingencies may occur, any of which might result in an accrual or a change in current accruals recorded by the Company. There can be no assurance that the ultimate disposition of contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. With the acquisition of Aquila Resources Inc. on December 10, 2021, the Company assumed substantial liabilities that relate to the gold and silver stream agreements with OBL. Under the agreements, OBL deposited a total of million upfront in exchange for a portion of the future gold and silver production from the Back Forty Project.

 ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation s The following discussion summarizes the results of operations of Gold Resource Corporation and its subsidiaries we, our, us, or the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and compares those results with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. It also analyzes the Company s financial condition as of September 30, 2024, and compares it to the financial condition as of December 31, 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis and the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes contained in the 2023 Annual Report. The discussion also presents certain non-GAAP financial measures that are important to management in its evaluation of the operating results, and which are used by management to compare the Company s performance with what it perceives to be peer group mining companies and are relied on as part of management s decision-making process. Management believes these measures may also be important to investors in evaluating the Company s performance. For a detailed description of each of the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, please see the discussion below under Non-GAAP Measures. Also see Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this Item 2 for important information regarding statements contained herein. Overview Gold Resource Corporation is a mining company that pursues gold, silver, and other metal projects that require reasonable capital requirements and could achieve high returns. DDGM is the Company s cornerstone asset comprised of six contiguous land parcels. The Company s focus is unlocking the significant upside potential of DDGM through optimization of the current operations, growing the existing resource by investing in exploration drilling, and identifying new opportunities near existing infrastructure. The primary mineral production comes from the Arista and Switchback underground mining areas. This mine and processing facilities can produce gold and silver dor as well as concentrates of copper, lead, and zinc. The Back Forty Project, when developed, is expected to produce gold and silver dor and concentrates of copper and zinc bearing gold and silver. Optimization work related to metallurgy and the economic model was completed during the third quarter of 2023 and the Company filed the Back Forty Project Technical Report Summary (S-K 1300) on October 26, 2023. Results of the work indicate a more robust economic project with no planned impacts to wetlands that is more protective of the environment, which should facilitate a successful mine permitting process. The Company s Board continues to evaluate its options with respect to unlocking the value of the Back Forty development project.

Ground Support Inspection DDGM faced a number of production challenges in the third quarter. Firstly, the typically arid region experienced several tropical storms that disrupted the material processing schedule due to increased rainfall. The high humidity levels further affected throughput and concentrate quality, resulting in customer payment delays. The operations team implemented process changes to minimize downtime and ensure continuity of operations for future wet weather-related disruptions. Secondly, the reduced availability of some of the critical mining equipment used both underground and on the surface impacted operational efficiency in the third quarter. To address this, replacement of old equipment is required, and the maintenance and engineering teams have developed action plans to improve, where possible, the readiness of this equipment. The Company is seeking additional capital for investment in new mining equipment. Lastly, geotechnical rehabilitation in Arista posed further slow-downs. Extensive rehabilitation efforts were undertaken in the third quarter to ensure the safety and accessibility of the production areas that have not been used for over two years. Critical support infrastructure was replaced and aligned with updated safety standards. This activity temporarily delayed access to these areas. Going forward, however, this work has positioned production with access to higher-grade material in the upcoming fourth quarter. The operations team continues to prioritize safety, efficiency, and continuous improvement in mitigating the impacts of these challenges and positioning the operation for stronger outcomes in the coming quarters. 
 DDGM Exploration Update The Company s portfolio of properties that make up DDGM are located along a 55-kilometer stretch of the San Jose structural corridor in the Sierra Madre Sur mountain range. This northwest trending structural corridor spans three historic mining districts in the state of Oaxaca. Strategic planning and prioritization of regional surface exploration activities continues across several properties, aiming to define additional high-value drill targets and demonstrating the Company s commitment to long-term investment in Oaxaca, Mexico. Underground infill exploration drilling continued from accessible areas within the Arista mine using a dedicated contract diamond drill rig in the third quarter of 2024. Due to the lack of additional drill stations in the Three Sisters system, as a result of the age and condition of some of the critical mining equipment in use at the mine, as well as decreased cash due to prior production shortfalls, as discussed above, the focus of infill drilling strategically shifted to the northwest extension of the Arista vein system, targeting the Marena North, Santa Cecilia and Splay 31 veins. The goal of this drilling is to upgrade inferred resources to the measured and indicated categories in the Splay 31 vein, while also identifying additional inferred resources in the Santa Cecilia and Marena North veins. All veins within the northwest extension of the Arista vein system remain open along strike to the northwest as well as up- and down-dip. However, infill drilling was suspended on August 1, 2024 to conserve cash while a second diamond drill rig, owned and operated by DDGM, was allocated to grade control drilling which continued as planned during the third quarter. This drilling provided additional information and comfort with respect to the detailed geologic modeling and that the mine plan can deliver ore from each area of the mine with the highest possible net smelter return NSR to the process plant. Although the Company believes

 this mine has significant potential to generate positive cash flow, based on the information to date from the new areas of the Three Sisters as well as other areas that have been discovered near the existing mining zones, the Company does not believe that the mine will generate sufficient free cash flow in the near term without the addition of these areas to the life-of-mine plan. Despite the equipment unavailability and cash flow shortages described above, the underground exploration drill program continued to advance the Company s 2024 exploration objectives of identifying and expanding new mineralization, while also defining and upgrading additional Mineral Resources identified during the previous drilling campaign. The third quarter drill results will be incorporated into a resource estimate update, scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2025. Preliminary calculations indicate a positive increase in tonnage and higher grades in the Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems. Following the completion of a planned 250 meters of exploration development on Level 3, which began in the third quarter of 2024, infill and expansion drilling will resume with the goal of expanding the Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems along strike to the north-west as well as up- and down-dip. During the third quarter of 2024, six infill drill holes were completed for a total of 1,399 meters and 20 grade control drill holes were completed for a total of 1,395 meters. The positive initial drill results have validated the continued capital investment in exploration drilling to date in 2024 and underscored the area s potential for future mineral resource expansion . Exploration drilling in the third quarter of 2024 targeted the following zones at the Arista mine: o Infill drilling from Level 3 focused on the Marena North, Santa Cecilia and Splay 31 veins along the northwest extension of the Arista system, aiming to upgrade and expand the Mineral Resources in these areas. Due to their proximity to existing mine infrastructure, these areas offer efficient and shorter-haul access to near-term mine production opportunities. To date, drilling along the northern extension of the Arista vein system has identified mineralization over an additional 300 meters along strike to the northwest from the current mining limits, with structures remaining open along strike to the northwest, as well as up- and down-dip. o Grade control drilling continued to focus on validating near-term production opportunities not previously realized within the mine. This included targeting the Sarabi and Selene veins in the Switchback system from Level 14.5, as well as successfully testing the Splay 31 and Splay 5 veins in the Arista system from Level 1 and Level 19, respectively. Definition of these zones allows mining operations increased flexibility in scheduling ore production for this area.

 (1) Based on actual days the mill operated during the period. (2) The difference between what the Company reports as ounces/tonnes produced and payable ounces/tonnes sold is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates the Company produces versus the portion of those metals actually paid for according to the terms of the Company s sales contracts. Differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules, or variances in ore grades and recoveries, which impact the amounts of metals contained in concentrates produced and sold.

 Third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 Production During the three months ended September 30, 2024, total tonnes milled of 83,690 were 28 lower than in the same period in 2023. Metal production for gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc decreased by 79 , 21 , 66 , 45 , and 46 , respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year. Although the lower tonnes processed and lower metal grades for all metals, with the exception of silver, were expected in the 2024 mine plan, the third quarter production was significantly impacted by the lack of availability of critical mining equipment and the lack of multiple faces to mine, in addition to the unfavorable weather conditions impacting the mining and processing operations. Grades Recoveries During the three months ended September 30, 2024, all of the ore processed came from the Arista mine with an average gold grade of 0.54 g/t and silver grade of 83 g/t, compared to an average gold grade of 1.52 g/t and silver grade of 73 g/t, respectively, for the same period in 2023. For the three months ending September 30, 2024, the average gold grade was 64 lower and the average silver grade was 14 higher when compared to the same period in 2023. This reduction in grade is partly due to the additional dilution caused by mining narrower veins, as scheduled in the third quarter. As shown in the Technical Report Summary for DDGM incorporated by reference in the 2023 Annual Report (the Technical Report Summary ), the ore grades are generally expected to decline over time in line with the life of mine average shown in the estimates of mineral reserves (as defined by subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, Mineral Reserve and mineral resources (as defined by subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, Mineral Resource tables contained therein (the Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Tables ). As grades decline, recoveries are expected to decline as well. The Company s base metals average grades during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.19 for copper, 1.01 for lead, and 2.63 for zinc. The copper, lead, and zinc grades were lower by 41 , 22 , and 19 , respectively, as compared to same period in 2023. Gold and silver recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 65.1 and 87.4 , respectively, reflecting a 16 decrease for gold and a 3 decrease for silver over the same period in 2023. Copper, lead, and zinc recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 57.4 , 68.2 , and 79.1 , respectively. Recoveries for copper, lead, and zinc in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, declined by 23 , 2 , and 7 , respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, metal recoveries were further impacted by filtration issues experienced in the processing plant during August and have since been resolved. Year-to-date 2024 compared to year-to-date 2023 Production During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total tonnes milled of 276,266 were 20 lower than in the same period in 2023. Metal production for gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc decreased by 47 , 17 , 41 , 50 , and 43 , respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year. Although lower tonnes processed and lower metal grades for all metals, with the exception of silver, were expected in the 2024 mine plan, production was significantly impacted by the lack of availability of critical mining equipment and the lack of multiple faces to mine, especially in the third quarter, in addition to the unfavorable weather conditions impacting the mining and processing operations. Grades Recoveries During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all of the ore processed came from the Arista system with an average gold grade of 1.27 g/t and silver grade of 91 g/t, compared to an average gold grade of 1.82 g/t and silver grade of 85 g/t, respectively, for the same period in 2023. To date in 2024, the average gold grade was 30 lower and the average silver grade 7 higher. As shown in the Technical Report Summary for DDGM incorporated by reference in the 2023

 Third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 Besides the expected lower tonnes mined and changes in metal grades and recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, the results of which were considered in the 2024 guidance disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report, the key drivers of the production and financial results relate to the issues the Company faced especially in the third quarter of 2024, including the issues with equipment availability due to the age and condition of some of the critical mining equipment, the decreasing cash and working capital, and the unprecedented weather and high humidity affecting our sales and production. Metal Sold During the three months ended September 30, 2024, gold sales of 1,357 ounces, silver sales of 181,434 ounces, copper sales of 98 tonnes, lead sales of 467 tonnes, and zinc sales of 1,473 tonnes decreased by 66 , 13 , 60 , 51 , and 43 , respectively, as compared to the same period in 2023. The lower metal production was partially expected due to mine sequencing, but challenges with equipment availability, the lack of multiple faces to mine, and the unusually wet hurricane season at the mine site also negatively affected the Company s metal sales and production. Average metal prices realized During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average metal prices were 2,561 per ounce for gold, 30.61 per ounce for silver, 8,832 per tonne for copper, 2,065 per tonne for lead, and 2,854 per tonne for zinc. Compared to the same period in 2023, the average metal price for gold and silver increased by 32 and 30 , respectively. The average metal price for copper and zinc also increased by 8 and 30 , respectively, while the average metal price for lead decreased by 6 . Year-to-date 2024 compared to year-to-date 2023 Besides the expected lower tonnes mined and changes in metal grades and recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, the results of which were considered in the 2024 guidance disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report, the key drivers of the production and financial results relate to the issues the Company faced in 2024, including the issues with equipment availability due to the age and condition of some of the critical mining equipment, the decreasing cash and working capital, and the unprecedented weather and high humidity affecting our sales and production. Narrower mining equipment would also be advantageous to reduce dilution. Metal Sold During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gold sales of 7,638 ounces, silver sales of 632,529 ounces, copper sales of 559 tonnes, lead sales of 1,625 tonnes, and zinc sales of 4,926 tonnes decreased by 48 , 19 , 38 , 56 , and 44 , respectively, as compared to the same period in 2023. The lower metal production was partially expected due to mine sequencing, but challenges with equipment availability, the lack of multiple faces to mine, the unusually wet hurricane season at the mine site, and decreased cash as a result of prior production shortfalls, also negatively affected the Company s metal sales and production. Average metal prices realized During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average metal prices were 2,309 per ounce for gold, 28.06 per ounce for silver, 9,260 per tonne for copper, 2,080 per tonne for lead, and 2,733 per tonne for zinc.

 Third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 Sales, net Net sales of 13.3 million for DDGM for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 7.3 million, or 35 , when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in 2024 net sales is the result of decreased production volumes as outlined in the sales statistics table above. Additionally, treatment and refining charges during the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 50 as a result of the decline in third quarter 2024 production as compared to third quarter 2023 production. Total cost of sales Total cost of sales of 21.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 12 from 25.0 million for the same period in 2023. The 3.1 million decrease was primarily related to a 1.8 million decrease in production cost and a 1.6 million decrease in depreciation expense. Production costs of 17.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are 9 lower than the production costs of 19.0 million for the same period in 2023. Mine gross (loss) profit For the three mon ths ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a mine gross loss of 8.7 million, compared to a mine gross loss of 4.4 million for the t hree mon ths ended September 30, 2023. Mine gross loss increased by 4.3 million, or 98 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in loss was primarily due to a 7.3 million, or 35 decrease in net sales, partially offset by a 1.8 million, or 9 decrease in production costs and a 1.6 million, or 28 decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses . The relationship between sales and the cost of sales, and therefore mine gross profit, is not perfectly correlated to the tonnes of ore processed. While both sales and the cost of sales are impacted by the tonnes of ore processed, other factors, such as the grade of ore processed, metal commodity prices, and operating costs have a significant impact on mine gross profit. In the third quarter of 2024, the tonnes of ore processed decreased by 28 , and the total cost of sales decreased by

 12 compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to a 22 lower cost per tonne processed; however, net sales decreased by 35 . The Company expects grades to vary from period to period based upon the potential for unplanned changes to the annual mine plan. Such unplanned changes, related to equipment availability and access limitations, were encountered by the Company in the third quarter of 2024. Based on the current mineral reserve estimate, the gold grades are expected to trend downwards over time, toward the average grade of 1.29 g/t (exclusive of silver, copper, lead, and zinc contained grades). However, as mine development progresses and infill drilling occurs, opportunities to access upgraded resources or refine mining methods and reduce dilution may have a favorable impact on future mined ore grades and updated mineral reserve estimates. Net loss For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of 10.5 million, compared to a net loss of 7.3 million during the same period in 2023. The 3.2 million increase in net loss is mainly attributable to the 35 decrease in net sales. Year-to-date 2024 compared to year-to-date 2023 Sales, net Net sales of 52.8 million for DDGM for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 23.8 million, or 31 , when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in 2024 net sales is the result of decreased sales volumes and lower realized metal prices for lead, as outlined in the sales statistics table above. Additionally, treatment and refining charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 53 as a result of the decline in the 2024 production as compared to the 2023 production. Total cost of sales Total cost of sales of 67.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 15 from 79.2 million for the same period in 2023. The 12.1 million decrease was primarily related to a 8.0 million decrease in production cost and a 5.3 million decrease in depreciation expense. Production costs of 51.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are 14 lower than the production costs of 59.1 million for the same period in 2023. Mine gross (loss) profit For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company had a mine gross loss of 14.4 million, compared to a mine gross loss of 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Mine gross loss increased by 11.7 million, or 433 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in loss was primarily due to a 23.8 million, or 31 decrease in net sales, partially offset by a 8.0 million, or 14 decrease in production costs and a 5.3 million, or 27 decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses . The relationship between sales and the cost of sales, and therefore mine gross profit, is not perfectly correlated to the tonnes of ore processed. While both sales and the cost of sales are impacted by the tonnes of ore processed, other factors, such as the grade of ore processed, metal commodity prices, and operating costs have a significant impact on mine gross profit. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the tonnes of ore processed decreased by 20 , and the total cost of sales decreased by 15 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023; however, net sales decreased by 31 . The Company expects grades to vary from period to period based upon the potential for unplanned changes to the annual mine plan. The gold grades are expected to trend downwards over time, toward the average grade of 1.29 g/t (exclusive of silver, copper, lead, and zinc contained grades), reflected in the Company s mineral reserve estimate. However, as mine development progresses and infill drilling occurs, opportunities to access upgraded resources or refine mining methods and reduce dilution may have a favorable impact on future mined ore grades.

 Underground and Exploration Development: Mine development during the third quarter of 2024 included ramps, access to different areas of the deposit, and ventilation shafts. A total of 19 meters of exploration development was completed on Level 3 during the third quarter of 2024 at a cost of 0.07 million in preparation for future drilling along strike to the northwest on the Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems. Drilling during the third quarter primarily utilized existing infrastructure developed in previous years. As part of ongoing safety initiatives, the Company also invested in additional ground support and improved ventilation for the mine. However, due to the continued reduction in equipment availability and the resulting decrease in production and cash, the Company has not been able to maintain its projected timeline for development of future production zones.

 Non-GAAP Measures Throughout this report, the Company has provided information prepared or calculated according to U.S. GAAP and have referenced certain non-GAAP performance measures that the Company believes will assist with understanding the performance of its business. These measures are based on precious metal gold equivalent ounces sold and include (i) cash cost after co-product credits per ounce and (ii) all-in sustaining cost after co-product credits AISC per ounce, and (iii) all-in cost after co-product credits per ounce. Because the non-GAAP performance measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. For financial reporting purposes, the Company reports the sale of base metals as part of its revenue. Revenue generated from the sale of base metals in the Company s concentrates is considered a co-product of its gold and silver production for the purpose of calculating its total cash cost after co-product credits for DDGM. The Company periodically reviews its revenues to ensure that its reporting of primary products and co-products is appropriate. Because the Company considers copper, lead, and zinc to be co-products of its precious metal production, the value of these metals continues to be applied as a reduction to total cash costs in its calculation of total cash cost after co-product credits per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold. Likewise, the Company believes identifying copper, lead, and zinc as co-product credits is appropriate due to their lower per unit economic value contribution compared to the precious metals and since gold and silver are the primary products it intends to produce. Total cash cost after co-product credits is a measure developed by the Gold Institute to provide a uniform standard for industry comparison purposes, and it includes total cash cost before co-product credits, less co-product credits, or revenues earned from base metals. AISC includes total cash cost after co-product credits plus other costs related to sustaining production, including allocated sustaining general and administrative expenses and sustaining capital expenditures. The Company determined sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. AISC is calculated based on the current guidance from the World Gold Council. Total all-in cost after co-product credits includes total AISC as described above, plus other growth investments, including exploration expenses and non-sustaining capital expenditures.

This represents a 9.1 million, or 60 , decrease from the working capital balance of 15.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The factors influencing the decrease in the Company s working capital were the cash used in investing activities of 5.2 million and the 2.0 million cash outflows from operating activities, partially offset by 2.4 million cash inflows from financing activities due to sales through the ATM agreement, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Interim Statements of Cash Flows . The Company s working capital balance fluctuates as it uses cash to fund its operations, financing, and investing activities, including exploration, mine development, and income taxes. Long-term liabilities assumed with the Aquila acquisition, capital requirements to develop the Back Forty Project, and potential project financing may have an impact on liquidity in the long term. These long-term liabilities are contingent upon the approval of the Back Forty Project by the Company s Board of Directors and securing project financing. Project 

 Gold Resource Corporation Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 48 

Table of Contents 
 financing requirements will not be determined until the Company s Board of Directors approves a decision to proceed on the Project. The Board continues to evaluate options that could lead to the development of the Project. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 decreased to 1.4 million from 6.3 million as of December 31, 2023, a net decrease in cash of 4.9 million. The decrease is primarily due to 5.2 million cash used in investing activities and the 2.0 million cash used in operating activities, partially offset by the 2.4 million cash inflow from financing activities due to the ATM sales. Of the 1.4 million cash balance as of September 30, 2024, 0.5 million was held in foreign subsidiaries, primarily held in U.S. dollar denominated accounts, with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to U.S. dollars. DDGM s primary source of liquidity is the sale of concentrates. DDGM has historically been self-sustaining and has been a source of cash for U.S. operations and projects. However, as a result of recent challenges encountered in mining and processing at DDGM, the Company is not currently generating positive cash flow from the Company s mining operations. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2.0 million, an 71 decrease compared to the 7.0 million net cash used in operating activities for the same period in 2023. While net sales decreased by 31 due to lower grades and lower recoveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, production costs only decreased by 14 due to the higher inflation. Net cash used in investing activities of 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from 9.8 million from the same period in 2023. The decrease is mainly attributed to planned reduction in investing activities to preserve cash. Investing activities in both 2024 and 2023 are mainly attributable to continued reinvestment in DDGM. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.4 million related to the ATM sales. Please see Note 14 Shareholders Equity in Item 1 Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Notes (unaudited) above for additional information. While current macro risk factors, such as economic uncertainties and supply chain interruptions have not had a significant adverse impact on exploration plans, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows during the current fiscal year, future impacts are unknown at this time. Tonnes and grade, with respect to the Company s mining operations at DDGM, have declined during 2024 and are below budget, especially in the third quarter. There are several factors that caused these declines. The Company has encountered significant issues with equipment availability due to the age and condition of some of the critical mining equipment in use at the mine. Due to the continued challenges with equipment availability and the decreased cash due to prior production shortfalls, the Company has not been able to maintain its projected timeline for development of future production zones. As a result, the Company is currently mining only one face at a time in areas that are accessible. The current lack of other available production zones has placed additional pressure on the Company s ability to achieve its production estimates, as any problems encountered at the current production zone cannot be offset by producing elsewhere in the mine. In addition, the mill also experienced some mechanical issues and wet ore handling difficulties due to unusually high rain fall that resulted in lower throughput and a production shortfall. To minimize the mechanical issues and return the mine to a cash positive position, capital is necessary to replace some of the mining fleet and upgrade the mill. The Company believes that the mine has significant potential to generate positive cash flow based on the information to date from the new areas of the Three Sisters as well as other areas that have been discovered near the existing mining zones. In order to develop access and better define these new areas, an investment must be made in the equipment and mine plan. Without the addition of these areas to the life-of-mine plan, the Company does not believe that the mine will generate sufficient free cash flow in the near term. The Company s inability to achieve its production estimates have created substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company currently anticipates that it will require approximately 7 million to obtain additional mining equipment and mill upgrades. These amounts include approximately 2.5 million in upgrades at the mill, including approximately 1.0 million to install a new filter to increase capacity in the filter plant and approximately 0.7

Table of Contents 
 million to obtain a spare ball gear. These investments also include approximately 4.5 million in mining equipment to replace old or inefficient equipment, including underground loaders, bolters, and drills. The Company also expects to require approximately 8 million in working capital in order to fund the initial development to access the Three Sisters and Splay 31 systems, although not all of this capital will be required immediately. Due to the 2024 production challenges described above, the Company does not believe that the mine will generate sufficient cashflow to fund these improvements. The Company is evaluating various financing options in order to fund this development in the near term. If the Company is unable to obtain this additional capital and successfully develop these new mining areas, the continued operation of the mine may not be possible beyond November 2024. If continued operation of the mine is not possible, the Company may be compelled to place the mine on care and maintenance status, which would likely trigger significant severance and other costs which the Company may not be able to pay. Accounting Developments For a discussion of recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see Note 2 New Accounting Pronouncements in Item 1 Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Notes (unaudited) above . Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company uses the words anticipate, continue, likely, estimate, expect, may, could, will, project, should, believe, and similar expressions (including negative and grammatical variations) to identify forward looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding: The Company s strategy for significant future investment in Oaxaca, Mexico, and in Michigan, USA, for development and exploration activities; The Company s expectations regarding future grades and recoveries from mining at DDGM; and its expectations regarding its ability to generate positive cash flow from future production at DDGM; Expectations regarding capital investment, exploration spending, and general and administrative costs, including the Company s near-term estimates for the cost of additional mining equipment, mill upgrades and working capital; The Company s anticipated near-term capital needs, and potential sources of capital; Future exploration plans at DDGM, including vein systems targeted for future exploration activity; Compliance with existing legal and regulatory requirements, including future asset reclamation costs; Estimates of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves; The Company s expectations regarding whether dividends will be paid in the future; The Company s ability to satisfy its obligations and other potential cash requirements over the next twelve months; and The expected timing and success of the Back Forty Project with respect to permitting, detailed engineering, and project financing. 
 Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Rather, they are based only on the Company s current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding the future of its business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy, and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict, and many of which are outside of the Company s control. The Company s actual results and financial condition

Table of Contents 
 may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause the Company s actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: Whether the Company is able to raise the necessary capital required to continue our business on terms acceptable to it or at all; Commodity price fluctuations; Mine protests and work stoppages; Rock formations, faults and fractures, water flow and possible CO2 gas exhalation, or other unanticipated geological challenges; Unexpected changes in business and economic conditions, including supply chain challenges, the rate of inflation, and their impact on operating and capital costs; Changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates; Adverse technological changes and cybersecurity threats; Unanticipated increases in the Company s operating costs and other costs of doing business; Access to land and availability of materials, equipment, supplies, labor and supervision, power, and water; Results of current and future feasibility studies; Interpretation of drill hole results and the geology, grade, and continuity of mineralization; Litigation by private parties or regulatory action by governmental entities; Acts of God, such as excessively wet weather, floods, earthquakes, and any other natural disasters; The inherent uncertainty of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates; and Such other factors are discussed below under Item 1A Risk Factors in Part II Other Information , and under Risk Factors in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Many of these factors are beyond the Company s ability to control or predict. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such expectations may prove to be materially incorrect due to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should not unduly rely on any of the Company s forward-looking statements. These statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by law, the Company is not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company and persons acting on its behalf are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company s exposure to market risks includes, but is not limited to, the following risks: changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, provisional sales contract risks, changes in interest rates, and equity price risks. Currently, the Company does not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk. However, the Company may consider such arrangements in the future as it evaluates its business and financial strategy. Commodity Price Risk The results of the Company s operations, cash flows, and financial condition largely depend upon the market prices of gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc. Metal prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company s control. The level of interest rates, the rate of inflation, government fiscal and monetary policy, the stability of exchange rates, and the world supply of and demand for gold, silver, and other metals, among other factors, can all cause significant fluctuations in commodity prices. Such external economic factors are, in turn, influenced by changes in international investment patterns, monetary systems, and political developments. The metal price markets have fluctuated widely in recent years, and future price declines could cause a mineral project to become uneconomic, thereby having a material adverse effect on the Company s business and financial condition. Currently, the Company is not unitizing derivative contracts to protect the selling price for gold, silver, copper, lead, or zinc. The Company may, in the future, more actively manage its exposure through additional derivative contracts, although the Company has no intention of doing so in the near term. In addition to materially adversely affecting the Company s reserve estimates, results of operations and/or its financial condition, declining gold and silver prices could require a reassessment of the feasibility of a project. Even if a project is ultimately determined to be economically viable, the need to conduct such a reassessment may cause delays in the implementation of a project. Foreign Currency Risk The Company s foreign operation sells its gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do not have a material impact on the Company s revenue since gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc are sold worldwide in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can increase or decrease the Company s costs to the extent that it pays costs in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company is primarily impacted by Mexican peso rate changes relative to the U.S. Dollar, as the Company incurs some costs in the Mexican peso. When the value of the peso rises in relation to the U.S. Dollar, some of the Company s costs in Mexico may increase, thus materially adversely affecting the Company s operating results. Alternatively, when the value of the peso drops in relation to the U.S. Dollar, peso-denominated costs in Mexico will decrease in U.S. Dollar terms. Future fluctuations may give rise to foreign currency exposure, which may affect the Company s financial results. Approximately 50 to 60 of expenses are paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company has not utilized market-risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. However, the Company may, in the future, actively manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. 

 Gold Resource Corporation 52 

Table of Contents 
 Provisional Sales Contract Risk The Company enters into concentrate sales contracts, which, in general, provide for a provisional payment to the Company based upon provisional assays and prices. The provisionally priced sales contracts contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of concentrates determined at the quoted metal prices at the time of shipment delivery to the customer. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is adjusted to market through revenue each period prior to settlement. Changes in the prices of metals between the shipment delivery and the final settlement date will result in adjustments to revenues related to the sales of concentrate previously recorded upon shipment delivery. Please see Note 15 Derivatives in Item 1 Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Notes (unaudited) above for additional information. Interest Rate Risk The Company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time, as the Company s interest rate is related and embedded in immaterial payments for office leases. Equity Price Risk The Company has, in the past, and may in the future, seek to acquire additional funding through the sale of common stock and other equity. The price of the Company s common stock has been volatile in the past and may also be volatile in the future. As a result, there is a risk that the Company may not be able to sell its common stock at an acceptable price should the need for new equity funding arise. ITEM 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures During the fiscal period covered by this report, the Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports are accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATIO N ITEM 1: Legal Proceedings In February 2020, a local Ejido community (who claim to be an indigenous community) filed an injunction against the Mexican federal government through which they demanded the cancellation of several DDGM concession titles. The federal government ordered a suspension to prevent work related to excavating, drilling, opening tunnels and exploiting the mineral resources on the surface and subsoil of the concessions named in the injunction. Presently, DDGM does not perform 

 Gold Resource Corporation 53 

Table of Contents 
 such works in the named concessions in lands of the indigenous community. The lawsuit filed in February 2020 has not progressed to a final ruling. The Company knows of no other material, existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. ITEM 1 A: Risk Factors Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Annual Report includes a discussion of the Company s known material risk factors, other than risks that could apply to any issuer or offering. Except as described below, there have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors from those described in the 2023 Annual Report. There is substantial doubt about whether the Company can continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2024, the Company s aggregate cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately 1.4 million. As a result of challenges encountered in mining and processing at DDGM, the Company is not currently generating positive cash flow from its mining operations. The Company s financial position and recent operating results, along with its inability to achieve its production estimates, raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Failure to raise some form of long-term debt arrangement or additional equity capital will cause the Company to further increase its working capital decline, and the Company may be compelled to place the mine on care and maintenance status and cease operations until sufficient capital is available. Additionally, even if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenue will be sufficient to enable it to achieve a level where it generates profits and positive cash flows from operations. The Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material. ITEM 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. ITEM 3: Defaults upon Senior Securities None. ITEM 4: Mine Safety Disclosures While the Company owns an advanced exploration project in Michigan, USA, the project is not yet subject to the Mine Safety and Health Administration jurisdiction and therefore, the mine safety disclosure requirements are not applicable.
