 anticipate, project, and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Forward-looking statements are made based upon information that is currently available
 or management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon us, speak only as of the date hereof, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly
 update or correct any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that subsequently occur, or of which we later become aware. Actual events, transactions and results may materially differ from the anticipated events, transactions,
 or results described in such statements. Our ability to consummate such transactions and achieve such events or results is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the matters set forth
 below:

 increases in our costs and wages and our ability to increase prices to our customers, negative impacts to the arrangements that have pricing commitments over the term of an agreement and/or the loss of key lenders or constricting credit
 markets as a result of changing interest rates, which may result in adverse changes in our results of operations and financial position;

significant adverse changes in, reductions in, or loss of one or more of our larger volume customers or vendors;

reliance on third-parties to perform some of our service obligations to our customers, and the reliance on a small number of key vendors in our supply chain with whom we do not have long-term supply agreements, guaranteed price
 agreements, or assurance of stock availability;

loss of our credit facility or credit lines with our vendors may restrict our current and future operations;

domestic and international economic regulations uncertainty e.g. , tariffs, sanctions, and trade agreements);

supply chain issues, including a shortage of IT products, may increase our costs or cause a delay in fulfilling customer orders, or increase our need for working capital, or delay completing professional services, or purchasing IT

exposure to changes in, interpretations of, or enforcement trends in, and customer and vendor actions in anticipation of or response to, legislation and regulatory matters;

our inability to identify acquisition candidates, perform sufficient due diligence prior to completing an acquisition, successfully integrate a completed acquisition, or identify an opportunity for or successfully
 complete a business disposition, may affect our earnings;

our service agreements may require external audits and deficiencies in any such reports could negatively affect our client engagements, and our professional and liability insurance policies coverage may be insufficient to cover a claim;

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The below is intended to further the reader s understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. It should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
 consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 2024 Annual Report ). These historical
 financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current
 expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2024 Annual Report, as well as in our other filings with the SEC.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION

We are a leading solutions provider in the areas of security, cloud, networking, collaboration, artificial intelligence AI ), and emerging technologies to domestic and foreign organizations across all industry segments. We deliver actionable
 outcomes for organizations by using information technology IT and consulting solutions to drive business agility and innovation. Leveraging our engineering talent, we assess, plan, deliver, and secure solutions comprised of leading technologies

 As part of our solutions, we provide consulting, professional services, managed services, IT staff augmentation, and complete lifecycle management services in the areas of security, cloud, networking, collaboration, and emerging technologies. With our acquisition of Bailiwick Services, LLC Bailiwick on August 19, 2024, our professional services segment also includes projects supporting digital signage, EV charging solutions, loss prevention and security,
 store openings, and store closings. Additionally, we offer flexible financing for purchases from us and from third parties. We have been in the business of selling, leasing, financing, and managing IT and other assets for more than 30
 years.

Our primary focus is to deliver integrated solutions that address our customers business needs, leveraging the appropriate technologies, both on-premises and in the cloud. Our approach is to lead with advisory consulting to understand our

 Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Proficio, Pure Storage, Rubrik, Splunk, Varonis, and VMware by Broadcom, among many others. We are an authorized reseller for thousands of vendors, which enables us to provide our customers with new and evolving IT

Our go-to-market strategy focuses primarily on diverse end-markets for middle market to large enterprises. We serve customers in markets including telecom, media and entertainment, technology, state and local government and educational
 institutions SLED ), healthcare, retail, and financial services. We sell to customers in the United States US ), which account for most of our sales, and to customers in select international markets including the United Kingdom UK ), the
 European Union EU ), India, and Singapore. Our technology business segments accounted for 97 of our net sales and 77 of our operating income, while our financing business segment accounted for 3 of our net sales and 23 of our operating income,
 for the six months ended September 30, 2024.

BUSINESS TRENDS

We believe the following key factors are impacting our business performance and our ability to achieve business results:

General economic concerns including inflation, rising interest rates, staffing shortages, remote work trends, and geopolitical concerns may impact our customers willingness to spend on technology and services.

From time to time, we experience price increases from our suppliers. While we generally have been able to pass price increases to our customers, rapid inflation could have a material impact on our sales, gross
 profit, or operating costs in the future. Our financing quotes are generally indexed to market rates to enable us to change rates from time of quote to funding. Financing transactions funded with our cash flows, not debt, are subject to
 interest rate risk. If the market interest rate exceeds our internal rate of return, we may not fund the transaction to obtain the proceeds and lock in our profit on the transaction. Also, we are experiencing constriction of funds available
 for certain transactions and more stringent assessment of our financing arrangements from our lender partners.

Our customers top focus areas include AI, security, cloud solutions, hybrid work environments (work from home, work from anywhere, and return to office), as well as digital transformation and modernization. We
 have developed advisory services, assessments, solutions, and professional and managed services to meet these priorities and help our customers attain and maintain their desired outcome.

Modernizing legacy applications, data modernization, reducing operational complexity, securing workloads, the cost and performance of IT operations, and agility are changing the way companies are purchasing and
 consuming technology. These are fueling deployments of solutions on cloud, managed services and hybrid platforms and licensing models, which may include invoicing over the term of the agreement.

Rapid cloud adoption has led to customer challenges around increasing costs, security concerns, and skillset gaps. These challenges are consistent across all industries and business sizes. We have developed a
 Cloud Managed Services portfolio to address these needs, allowing our clients to focus on driving business outcomes via optimized and secure cloud platforms.

KEY BUSINESS METRICS

Our management monitors several financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis to track the progress of our business. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include net sales, gross profit and margin,
 operating income margin, net earnings, and net earnings per common share, in each case based on information prepared in accordance with US GAAP, as well as the non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin,
 Non-GAAP: Net earnings and Non-GAAP: Net earnings per common share - diluted.

29 

Table of Contents 

We also use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the operating performance of our business, develop financial forecasts, make strategic decisions, and prepare and approve annual budgets. We use gross billings as an operational
 metric to assess the volume of transactions or market share for our technology business segments product, professional services, and managed services as well as to understand changes in our accounts receivable and accounts payable balances and our
 statement of cash flows. We believe gross billings will aid investors in the same manner.

These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with US GAAP and presented in our consolidated financial statements, as well as non-GAAP and operational performance measurement tools. Generally, a non-GAAP
 financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are correspondingly not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and
 presented in accordance with US GAAP. Our use of non-GAAP information as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results reported under GAAP, as these measures
 used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

Set forth in footnotes (1) and (2) of the tables that immediately follow the next paragraph, we set forth our reasons for using and presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP: Net earnings and Non-GAAP: Net earnings per common
 share-diluted in the tables and discussion that follow.

Non-GAAP: Net earnings and Non-GAAP: Net earnings per common share diluted are based on net earnings calculated in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted to exclude other (income) expense, share-based compensation, and acquisition and
 integration expenses, and the related tax effects.

We use Non-GAAP: Net earnings and Non-GAAP: Net earnings per common share diluted as supplemental measures of our performance to gain insight into our operating performance and performance trends. We believe that the
 exclusion of other income and acquisition-related amortization expense in calculating Non-GAAP: Net earnings and Non-GAAP: Net earnings per common share diluted provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of
 our business and operating results by excluding items that management believes are not reflective of our underlying operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that Non-GAAP: Net earnings and Non-GAAP: Net earnings per common share diluted
 provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results. However, our use of non-GAAP information as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes
 for analysis of our financial results as reported under US GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate similar Non-GAAP: Net earnings and Non-GAAP: Net earnings per common share diluted or similarly
 titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures. Our acquisition related expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 are related to our acquisition of Bailiwick.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings calculated in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted for the following: interest expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, provision for
 income taxes, and other income. Adjusted EBITDA presented for the technology business segments and the financing business segment is defined as operating income calculated in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted for interest expense, share-based
 compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and depreciation and amortization. We consider the interest on notes payable from our financing business segment and depreciation expense presented within cost of sales, which includes
 depreciation on assets financed as operating leases, to be operating expenses. As such, they are not included in the amounts added back to net earnings in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. In the table below, we provide a reconciliation of
 Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings, which is the most directly comparable financial measure to this non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA margin is our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.

We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into our operating performance and performance trends. We believe that the exclusion of other income in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and
 Adjusted EBITDA margin provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business and operating results by excluding items that management believes are not reflective of our underlying operating performance.
 Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results. However, our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as

Gross billings are the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services including shipping charges during the period, net of customer returns and credit memos, sales, or other taxes. Gross
 billings includes the transaction values for certain sales transactions that are recognized on a net basis, and, therefore, includes amounts that will not be recognized as revenue.

 three-month period in the prior year. The decrease in net sales was driven by lower product revenues offset by higher managed services and professional services revenue from our technology business segments, and higher revenues from our financing
 business segment. For additional information, see the Segment Results of Operations below.

Net sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 8.8 to 1,059.7 million, or a decrease of 102.1 million compared to 1,161.8 million in the same six-month period in the prior year. The decrease in
 net sales was driven by lower product revenues offset by higher managed services and professional services revenue from our technology business segments, and higher revenues from our financing business segment. For additional information, see the
 Segment Results of Operations below.

Gross profit : Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 2.5 , to 148.0 million, compared to 144.4 million in the same three-month period in the prior year as increases in

SEGMENT OVERVIEW

TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Our technology business includes three segments: product, professional services, and managed services as further discussed below.

Product segment: Our product segment consists of the sale of third-party hardware, third-party perpetual and subscription software, and third-party maintenance, software assurance, and other third-party
 services. The product segment also includes internet-based business-to-business supply chain management solutions for IT products.

Professional services segment: Our professional services segment includes our advanced professional services to our customers that are performed under time and materials, fixed fee, or milestone contracts.
 Professional services include consulting, assessments, configuration, logistic services, training, staff augmentation services, and project management services. With the acquisition of Bailiwick, our professional services also include
 projects supporting digital signage, EV charging solutions, loss prevention and security, store openings, and store closings.

Managed services segment: Our managed services segment includes our advanced managed services that encompass managing various aspects of our customers environments that are billed in regular intervals over a
 contract term, usually between three to five years. Managed services also include security solutions, storage-as-a-service, cloud hosted services, cloud managed services, and service desk.

We manage the technology business segments based on gross profit and the operating expenses associated with these segments in total as our technology business.

Our technology business segments sell primarily to corporations and SLED institutions. Customers of our technology business may have a customer master agreement CMA with our company, which stipulates the terms and
 conditions of the commercial relationship. Some CMAs contain pricing arrangements, and most contain mutual voluntary termination clauses. Our other customers place orders using purchase orders without a CMA in place or with other documentation
 customary for the business. Often, our work with state and local governments is based on public bids and our written bid responses. Our service engagements are generally governed by statements of work and are primarily fixed price (with allowance for
 changes); however, some service agreements are based on time and materials.

We endeavor to minimize the cost of sales in our product segment through incentive programs provided by vendors and distributors. The programs we qualify for are generally set by our reseller authorization level with
 the vendor. The authorization level we achieve and maintain governs the types of products we can resell as well as such items as variable discounts applied against the list price, funds provided for the marketing of these products and other special
 promotions. These authorization levels are achieved by us through purchase volume, certifications held by sales executives or engineers and/or contractual commitments by us. The authorization levels are costly to maintain, and these programs
 continually change; therefore, there is no guarantee of future reductions of costs provided by these vendor consideration programs.

FINANCING BUSINESS SEGMENT

Our financing business segment offers financing solutions to corporations, government contractors, and SLED institutions in the US, which accounts for most of our transactions, and to corporations in select international markets including Canada,
 the UK, and the EU. Our financing business segment leases IT equipment, medical equipment, and other equipment, and sells the off-lease equipment at the end of the lease. Additionally, our financing business
 segment finances purchases of third-party software licenses, software assurance, maintenance, and other services.

Financing revenue generally falls into the following three categories:

Portfolio income: Interest income from financing receivables and rents due under operating leases.

Transactional gains: Net gains or losses on the sale of financial assets.

Post-contract earnings: Month-to-month rents; early termination, prepayment, make-whole, or buyout fees; and the sale of off-lease (used) equipment.

FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS

Our operating results may fluctuate due to customer demand for our products and services, supplier costs, product availability, changes in vendor incentive programs, interest rate fluctuations, currency fluctuations,
 the timing of sales of financial assets, general economic conditions, and differences between estimated residual values and actual amounts realized for leased equipment. We expect to continue to expand by hiring additional staff for specific targeted
 market areas and roles whenever we can find both experienced personnel and desirable geographic areas over the longer term, which may impact our operating results.

Net sales : Net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, increased compared to the three and six months
 ended September 30, 2023, due to higher transactional gains and portfolio earnings offset by lower post-contract earnings. Transactional gains increased due to increased volume and higher gains on the sale of financial assets due in part to several
 large transactions in the current quarter. Total proceeds from sales of financing receivables were 277.0 million and 220.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Total proceeds from sales of financing
 receivables were 324.9 million and 282.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Portfolio earnings increased due to higher average investments outstanding as well as a higher average earnings rate.
 Post-contract earnings decreased due to lower proceeds from sales of off-lease equipment, and lower month-to-month rents.

Table of Contents 

Gross Profit : Gross profit for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, increased compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, due to
 the increase in transactional gains. 

Selling, general and administrative : Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended September 30,
 2024, increased compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in variable compensation attributable to the increase in gross profit.

Our financing business segment employed 34 people as of September 30, 2024, compared to 35 people as of September 30, 2023. Certain support functions for the financing business segment are shared resources with the
 technology business and expenses are allocated accordingly.

Interest and financing costs : Interest and financing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, remained flat compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest
 and financing costs for the six months ended September 30, 2024, increased compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher average outstanding borrowings offset by lower interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, our non-recourse
 notes payable decreased to 38.7 million from 51.5 million as of September 30, 2023. Our weighted average interest rate for non-recourse notes payable was 5.75 and 5.84 as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

CONSOLIDATED

Other income : Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.6 million, compared to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
 Higher other income was driven by increased interest income offset by increased foreign exchange losses. We had 2.4 million in interest income for the three months ended September 30 , 2024, compared to 0.4 million for the three months
 ended September 30, 2023. We had foreign exchange losses of 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30 , 2024, compared to losses of 0.3 million for the same three-month period in the prior year.

Other income for the six months ended September 30, 2024, was 2.7 million, compared to 0.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Higher other income was driven by increased interest income offset
 by increased foreign exchange losses. We had 4.9 million in interest income for the six months ended September 30 , 2024, compared to 0.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. We had foreign exchange losses of 2.3 million for the six months ended September 30 , 2024, compared to losses of 0.5 million for the same six-month period in the prior year.

Provision for income taxes : Our provision for income tax expense for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, was 12.0 million and 22.2 million, respectively, as compared to 12.3 million and 25.0
 million for the same three-and six-month periods in the prior year, respectively. Our effective income tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, were 27.7 and 27.4 , respectively, compared to 27.4 and 27.3 for the three
 and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate was higher for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same three- and six-month periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher state
 effective tax rates and more non-deductible executive compensation in the current period.

The OECD's Pillar Two Initiative established a 15 global minimum tax for specific multinational groups surpassing annual revenue thresholds. Several countries where e Plus
 operates have enacted this tax effective January 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, e Plus inc. remains unaffected by the minimum tax due to qualifying for transitional safe harbor exemptions in many
 jurisdictions. We will continue to monitor any future impact as additional countries enact legislation to adopt this tax.

Net earnings : Net earnings for the three months ended September 30 , 2024, were 31.3 million, a decrease of 4.3 or 1.4 million, as compared to 32.7 million for the same three-month period in the prior year. The net earnings decrease was
 due to a decrease in operating profits from our technology business, offset by an increase in operating profits from our financing business segment, an increase in other income, driven by increased interest income, and a decrease in provision for
 income taxes. Net earnings for the six months ended September 30 , 2024, were 58.6 million, a decrease of 11.9 or 7.9 million, as compared to 66.5 million
 in the same six-month period in the prior year. The net earnings decrease was due to the decrease in operating profits from our technology business, offset by an increase in operating profits from our financing business segment, an increase in
 other income, driven by increased interest income, and a decrease in provision for income taxes.

 2024, and 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY OVERVIEW

We finance our operations through funds generated from operations and through borrowings. We use those funds to meet our capital requirements, which have historically consisted primarily of working capital for
 operational needs, capital expenditures, purchases of equipment for lease, payments of principal and interest on indebtedness outstanding, acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock.

Our borrowings in our technology business segments are through our WFCDF Credit Facility. Our borrowings in our financing business segment are primarily through secured borrowings that involve transferring all or part
 of the contractual payments due to us to third-party financing institutions.

We believe that cash on hand and funds generated from operations, together with available credit under our credit facility, will be enough to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, and other requirements
 for at least the next year.

Our ability to continue to expand, both organically and through acquisitions, is dependent upon our ability to generate enough cash flow from operations or from borrowing or other sources of financing as may be
 required. While at this time we do not anticipate requiring any additional sources of financing to fund operations, if demand for IT products declines, or if our supply of products is delayed or interrupted, our cash flows from operations may be
 substantially affected.

To manage our working capital, we monitor our cash conversion cycle for our technology business segments, which is defined as days sales outstanding DSO in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory DIO minus days of purchases
 outstanding in accounts payable DPO ).

The following table presents the components of the cash conversion cycle for our technology business segments:

As of September 30,

(3) 

Represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of accounts payable-trade and accounts payable-floor plan for our technology business segments at the end of the period divided by the direct cost of products and services
 billed to our customers for the same three-month period.

Our cash conversion cycle decreased to 32 days as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 51 days as of September 30, 2023. Our standard payment term for customers is between 30-60 days; however, certain customer orders may be approved for extended
 payment terms. Our DSO decreased 3 days to 66 days as of September 30, 2024, compared to 69 days as of September 30, 2023, reflecting lower sales to customers with terms greater than or equal to net 60 days. Our DIO decreased to 12 days as of
 September 30, 2024, compared to 29 days as of September 30, 2023. Our DPO decreased by 1 day as of September 30, 2024. Invoices processed through our credit facility, or the A/P-floor plan balance, are typically paid within 45-60 days from the
 invoice date, while A/P trade invoices are typically paid around 30 days from the invoice date.

Financing business segment : For the six months ended September 30, 2024, our financing business segment used 35.2 million from operating activities, primarily due to changes in financing receivables,
 offset by net earnings and increases in accounts payable. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, our financing business segment used 5.4 million from operating activities, primarily due to changes in financing receivables and accounts
 receivable, offset by net earnings.

Cash flows related to investing activities : For the six months ended September 30, 2024 , we used 127.7 million in investing activities, consisting of 124.6
 million for the acquisition of Bailiwick, and 3.3 million for purchases of property, equipment and operating lease equipment offset by 0.2 million of proceeds from the sale of property, equipment, and operating lease equipment. For the six months
 ended September 30, 2023 , we used 53.8 million in investing activities, consisting of 48.6 million for the acquisition of Network Solutions Group NSG ), and 5.6 million for purchases of property,
 equipment and operating lease equipment offset by 0.4 million of proceeds from the sale of property, equipment, and operating lease equipment. 

Cash flows from financing activities : For the six months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 14.3 million, consisting of cash used to repurchase outstanding shares of our
 common stock of 23.6 million, net repayments of non-recourse and recourse notes payable of 0.8 million, and 2.3 million paid to the sellers of Peak Resources, Inc. based on adjustments to total net assets delivered in our acquisition, partially
 offset by net borrowings on the floor plan component of our credit facility of 10.6 million, and proceeds of issuance of common stock to employees under an employee stock purchase plan of 1.8 million. For
 the six months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 22.6 million, consisting of net borrowings of non-recourse and recourse notes payable of 11.5 million, net borrowings on the floor plan component of our
 credit facility of 18.0 million, and proceeds of issuance of common stock to employees under an employee stock purchase plan of 1.4 million, partially offset by 8.4 million in cash used to repurchase
 outstanding shares of our common stock . 

Other than recourse borrowings under our WFCDF Credit Facility, our borrowing of recourse and non-recourse notes payable primarily arises from our financing business segment when we transfer contractual payments due to
 us under lease and financing agreements to third-party financial institutions. When the transfers do not meet the requirements for a sale, the proceeds paid to us represent borrowings of recourse or non-recourse notes payable.

Non-cash activities : We transfer contractual payments due to us under lease and financing agreements to third-party financial institutions. In certain assignment agreements, we may
 direct the third-party financial institution to pay some of the proceeds from the assignment directly to the vendor or vendors that have supplied the assets being leased or financed. In these situations, the portion of the proceeds paid directly to
 our vendors are non-cash transactions.

SECURED BORROWINGS

We may finance all or most of the cost of the assets that we finance for customers by transferring all or part of the contractual payments due to us to third-party financing institutions. When we account for the
 transfer as a secured borrowing, we recognize the proceeds as either recourse or non-recourse notes payable. Our customers are responsible for repaying the debt from a secured borrowing. The lender typically secures a lien on the financed assets at
 the time the financial assets are transferred and releases it upon collecting all the transferred payments. We are not liable for the repayment of non-recourse loans unless we breach our representations and warranties in the loan agreements. The
 lender assumes the credit risk and their only recourse, upon default by the customer, is against the customer and the specific equipment under lease. While we expect that the credit quality of our financing arrangements and our residual return
 history will continue to allow us to obtain such financing, such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Interest rates have been rising and may continue to rise. To preserve our expected internal rate of return, we generally
 quote rates that are indexed. Some of our lenders will not commit to rates for a length of time, resulting in exposure to us if the rates rise and we cannot pass such exposure to the customer.

CREDIT FACILITY

We finance the operations of our subsidiaries e Plus Technology, inc., e Plus Technology Services, inc. and SLAIT Consulting, LLC
 (collectively, the Borrowers in our technology business segments through a credit facility with WFCDF. The WFCDF Credit Facility has a floor plan facility and a revolving credit facility.

Please refer to Note 8 , Notes Payable and Credit Facility to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Part I, Item 1.
 Financial Statements" for additional information concerning our WFCDF Credit Facility.

Floor plan facility : We finance most purchases of products for sale to our customers through the floor plan facility. Once our customer
 places a purchase order with us and we have approved their credit, we place an order for the desired products with one of our vendors. Our vendors are generally paid by the floor plan facility and our liability is reflected in accounts
 payable floor plan in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Most customer payments to us are remitted to our lockbox accounts. Once payments are cleared, the monies in the lockbox accounts are automatically and daily transferred to our operating account. We pay down the floor
 plan facility on three specified dates each month, generally 45-60 days from the invoice date. Our borrowings and repayments under the floor plan component are included in net borrowings (repayments) on floor plan facility within cash flows from
 the financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, we had a maximum credit limit, including the revolving credit facility, of 500.0 million, and an outstanding balance on the floor plan facility
 of 115.7 million and 105.1 million, respectively. On our balance sheet, our liability under the floor plan facility is presented as part of accounts payable floor plan.

Revolving credit facility : Our borrowings and repayments under the revolving credit facility are included in borrowings of non-recourse and recourse notes payable and repayments of non-recourse
 and recourse notes payable, respectively, within cash flows from the financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, we did not have any outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility. The maximum credit limit under this facility was 200.0 million as of both September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024.

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES

In the normal course of business, we may provide certain customers with performance guarantees, which are generally backed by surety bonds. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event of
 default in the performance of our obligations. We are in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee, and we believe that any liability incurred in connection with these
 guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or
 special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements, or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we were not involved in any unconsolidated
 special purpose entity transactions.

ADEQUACY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES

The continued implementation of our business strategy will require a significant investment in both resources and managerial focus. In addition, we may selectively acquire other companies that have
 attractive customer relationships and skilled sales and/or engineering forces. We may also open facilities in new geographic areas, which may require a significant investment of cash. We may also acquire technology companies to expand and enhance our
 geographic footprint, or the platform of bundled solutions to provide additional functionality and value-added services. We may require additional capital due to increases in inventory to accommodate our customers IT installation schedules. We may
 continue to use our internally generated funds to finance investments in leased assets or investments in notes receivable due from our customers. These actions may result in increased working capital needs as the business expands. As a result, we may
 require additional financing to fund our strategy, implementation, potential future acquisitions, and working capital needs, which may include additional debt and equity financing. While the future is uncertain, we do not believe our WFCDF Credit
 Facility will be terminated by WFCDF or us. Additionally, while our lending partners in our financing business segment continue to be discerning in their approval processes, we currently have funding resources available for our transactions.

POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS

Our future quarterly operating results and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate. In the event our revenues or earnings for any quarter are less than the level expected by securities analysts or the market
 in general, such shortfall could have an immediate and significant adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. Any such adverse impact could be greater if any such shortfall occurs near the time of any material decrease in any widely
 followed stock index or in the market price of the stock of one or more public equipment leasing and financing companies, IT resellers, software competitors, major customers, or vendors of ours.

Our quarterly results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, reduction in IT spending, shortages of product from our vendors
 due to material shortages, any reduction of expected residual values related to the equipment under our leases, the timing and mix of specific transactions, the reduction of manufacturer incentive programs, and other factors. Quarterly operating
 results could also fluctuate as a result of our sale of equipment in our lease portfolio to a lessee or third-party at the expiration of a lease term or prior to such expiration, and the transfer of financial assets. Sales of equipment and
 transfers of financial assets may have the effect of increasing revenues and net income during the quarter in which the sale occurs and reducing revenues and net income otherwise expected in subsequent quarters. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk
 Factors , in our 2024 Annual Report, as supplemented in subsequently filed reports, and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report. 

We believe that comparisons of quarterly results of our operations are not necessarily meaningful and that results for one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

As disclosed in Note 2 , Recent Accounting Pronouncements, we adopted a new standard on accounting for contract
 assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination in the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023. Under this new standard, we apply Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Contracts with Customers, to
 recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers. Other than this change, our critical accounting estimates have not changed from those reported in Item 7 , Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
 of Operations in our 2024 Annual Report. 

Item 3.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Although a substantial portion of our liabilities are non-recourse, fixed-interest-rate instruments, we utilize lines of credit and other financing facilities that are subject to fluctuations in short-term interest
 rates. Our non-recourse instruments, which are denominated in US dollars, were entered for other than trading purposes and bear interest at a fixed rate. Because the interest rate on these instruments is fixed, changes in interest rates will not
 directly impact our cash flows. Financing transactions funded with our cash flows, not debt, are subject to interest rate risk. If the market interest rate exceeds our internal rate of return, we may not fund the transaction to obtain the proceeds.
 Borrowings under the WFCDF Credit Facility bear interest at a market-based variable rate. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate fair value of our recourse and non-recourse borrowings approximated their carrying value.

We have foreign currency exposure when transactions are not denominated in our subsidiaries functional currency, which include purchases and sales of the products and services we provide, as well as loans with other e Plus entities. Additionally, we lease assets in foreign countries, including Canada, the UK, and several other European countries. As a lessor, we lease assets for amounts denominated in British Pounds, Euros,
 and Canadian dollars. To date, foreign currency exposure associated with purchases and sales of the products and services we provide has not been significant. We have incurred foreign currency transaction gains and losses in certain foreign
 subsidiaries on US dollar denominated loans. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our results of operations and financial position.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief
 Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, or disclosure controls, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed
 to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
 Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and
 CFO, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls include some, but not all, components of our internal control over financial reporting. Based upon that
 evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

On August 19, 2024, our subsidiary, e Plus Technology, inc., acquired 100 of the membership interests of
 Bailiwick. We excluded Bailiwick from our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 . We are in the process of integrating
 Bailiwick into our system of internal control over financial reporting. Other than the foregoing, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have
 materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

LIMITATIONS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system cannot provide
 absolute assurance due to its inherent limitations; it is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. A control system also can be circumvented by collusion
 or improper management override. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of such limitations, disclosure
 controls and internal control over financial reporting cannot prevent or detect all misstatements, whether unintentional errors or fraud. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process; therefore, it is
 possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
