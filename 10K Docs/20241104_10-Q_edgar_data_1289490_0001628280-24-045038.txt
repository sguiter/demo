 the uncertainty of expected future financial performance and results of the combined company following completion of the Life Storage merger; 
 failure to close pending acquisitions and developments on expected terms, or at all; 
 the effect of competition from new and existing stores or other storage alternatives, including increased or unanticipated competition for our properties, which could cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; 
 potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; 
 the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state, and local laws and regulations including, without limitation, those governing real estate investment trusts REITs ), tenant reinsurance and other aspects of our business, which could adversely affect our results; 
 our ability to recover losses under our insurance policies; 
 disruptions in credit and financial markets and resulting difficulties in raising capital or obtaining credit at reasonable rates or at all, which could impede our ability to grow; 
 our reliance on information technologies, which are vulnerable to, among other things, attack from computer viruses and malware, hacking, cyberattacks and other unauthorized access or misuse, any of which could adversely affect our business and results; 
 changes in global financial markets and increases in interest rates; 
 availability of financing and capital, the levels of debt that we maintain and our credit ratings; 
 risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and development of properties, including increased development costs due to additional regulatory requirements related to climate change and other factors;

 our lack of sole decision-making authority with respect to our joint venture investments; 
 the effect of recent or future changes to U.S. tax laws; 
 the failure to maintain our REIT status for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

 The Company did not have any significant assets or liabilities that are re-measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Long-lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. The Company reviews each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. The Company focuses on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. For these stores, the Company determines whether the decrease is temporary or permanent, and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, the Company reviews stores in the lease-up stage and compares actual operating results to original projections. 
 When the Company determines that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, the Company compares the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets. 
 When real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs. The Company compares the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the discounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, the Company would recognize a loss on the assets held for sale. The operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had stores classified as held for sale which are included in real estate assets, net. Of the stores, nine had an

 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss of as the fair value of these nine stores was less than the net carrying value. 
 The Company assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company s investments in unconsolidated real estate entities may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. An investment is impaired if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred, and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. 
 The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events, circumstances, and other related factors indicate that the fair value of the related reporting unit may be less than the carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to exceed the aggregate carrying amount, no impairment charge is recorded. Otherwise, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount in which the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value. No impairments of goodwill were recorded for any period presented herein. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, other financial instruments included in other assets, net, accounts payable and accrued expenses, variable-rate notes payable, investments in debt securities and notes receivable, revolving lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximate fair value. Restricted cash is comprised of funds deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States primarily relating to operating cash reserve for the Company's captive insurance subsidiary and earnest money deposits on potential acquisitions. 
 
 The fair values of the Company s fixed-rate notes payable were estimated using the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made on such debt (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rates used approximated current market rates for loans, or groups of loans, with similar maturities and credit quality.

The Company also paid off in secured loans.

 Fair Value Measurement 
 
 The estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were primarily based on information that was available as of the closing date of the Life Storage Merger. The methodology used to estimate the fair values to apply purchase accounting and the ongoing financial statement impact, if any, are summarized below. 
 
 Real estate assets Real estate assets acquired were recorded at fair value using standard valuation methodologies, including the cost and market approaches. The remaining useful lives for real estate assets, excluding land, were reset to years. Tenant relationships for storage leases were recorded at fair value based on estimated costs the Company avoided to replace them. Tenant relationships are amortized to expense over months, which is based on the Company s historical experience with turnover in its stores. 
 Equity investment in joint venture partnerships Equity investment in joint venture partnerships were recorded at fair value based on a direct capitalization of net operating income. 
 Intangible assets - other Customer relationships relating to tenant reinsurance contracts were recorded at fair value based on the income approach which estimates the potential revenue loss the Company avoided to replace them. These assets are amortized to expense over months, which is based on the Company s historical experience with average length of stay for tenants. 
 Trade name Trade names were recorded at fair value based on royalty payments avoided had the trade name been owned by a third party. This is determined using market royalty rates and a discounted cash flow analysis under the relief-from-royalty method. This method incorporates various assumptions, including projected revenue growth rates, the terminal growth rate, the royalty rate to be applied, and the discount rate utilized. The trade name is an indefinite lived asset and as such is not amortized. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company decided to operate

 In September 2024, the Company amended existing triple-net lease agreements for land and buildings related to stores that had initially been entered into in June and August 2019. The Company also entered into new triple-net lease agreements for land and buildings related to additional stores. Both the initial stores and the additional stores added to the triple net lease structure are categorized as operating leases and have been presented in real estate assets - operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had stores classified as held for sale which are included in real estate assets, net. Of the stores, nine had an estimated fair value, net of selling costs, less than the carrying value of the assets.

 GAAP requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section, but separate from the company s equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations, and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity. 
 
 The Company has evaluated the terms of the OP Units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by the OP Units as stockholders equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying amount, or (2) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) appearing elsewhere in this report and the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Form 10-Q entitled Statement on Forward-Looking Information . 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Our notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report and the audited financial statements contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 describe the significant accounting policies essential to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Preparation of our financial statements requires estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions that we have used are appropriate and correct based on information available at the time they were made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect our reported assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the period presented. If there are material differences between these estimates, judgments and assumptions and actual facts, our financial statements may be affected. 
 
 In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require our judgment in its application. There are areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result, but there are some areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would produce a materially different result. See the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust REIT ), formed to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop self-storage properties stores ). We derive substantially all of our revenues from our two segments: storage operations and tenant reinsurance. Primary sources of revenue for our storage operations segment include rents received from tenants under leases at each of our wholly-owned stores. Our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. Consequently, management spends a significant portion of their time maximizing cash flows from our diverse portfolio of stores. Revenue from our tenant reinsurance segment consists of insurance revenues from the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores. 
 Our stores are generally situated in highly visible locations clustered around large population centers. The clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. To maximize the performance of our stores, we employ industry-leading revenue management systems. Developed by our management team, these systems enable us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions. We believe our systems and processes allow us to more pro-actively manage revenues. 
 We operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose. Competition has impacted, and will continue to impact, our store results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. We believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industry leading technology systems. We consider a store to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1 of the current year, or has been open for three years prior to January 1 of the current year. 

31 

PROPERTIES 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned or had ownership interests in 2,401 operating stores. Of these stores, 1,934 are wholly-owned, seven are in consolidated joint ventures, and 460 are in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we managed an additional 1,461 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own and/or manage to 3,862. These stores are located in 42 states and Washington, D.C. The majority of our stores are clustered around large population centers. The clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. Our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 2,245,000 tenants were leasing storage units at the operating stores that we own and/or manage, primarily on a month-to-month basis, providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually, for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends. Although leases are short-term in duration, the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time. For stores that were stabilized as of September 30, 2024, the average length of stay for tenants who have vacated was approximately 17.2 months. 
 
 The average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores, net of discounts and bad debt, was 20.55 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average annual rent per square foot for new leases was 13.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.63 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average discounts, as a percentage of rental revenues, at all stabilized properties during these periods were 2.2 and 2.7 , respectively. 
 
 Our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations. Most often sites are what we consider hybrid stores, a mix of drive-up and multi-floor buildings.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Amounts in thousands, except store and share data 
 
 Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Overview 
 Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the operations of 2,401 stores (1,934 wholly-owned, seven in consolidated joint ventures, and 460 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which included the operations of 2,369 stores (1,896 wholly-owned, two in a consolidated joint venture, and 471 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method). 
 
 Revenues 
 The following table presents information on revenues earned for the periods indicated: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Revenues: Property rental 710,874 650,887 59,987 9.2 2,096,018 1,525,596 570,422 37.4 Tenant reinsurance 84,048 69,128 14,920 21.6 249,100 165,265 83,835 50.7 Management fees and other income 29,882 28,019 1,863 6.6 89,888 71,609 18,279 25.5 Total revenues 824,804 748,034 76,770 10.3 2,435,006 1,762,470 672,536 38.2 
 
 Property Rental The increase in property rental revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase of 561,324 associated with the merger of Life Storage (the Life Storage Merger ), other acquisitions completed in 2023, and acquisitions completed in the first nine months of 2024. We acquired 771 wholly-owned stores in 2023 and an additional 20 wholly-owned stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Life Storage Merger occurred on July 20, 2023; therefore the three months ended September 30, 2024 include the additional store count for the full quarter compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 only including the significantly increased store count from the Merger date forward. 
 
 Tenant Reinsurance The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of stores operated. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the larger store count from the Life Storage Merger for the entire respective periods, while the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 only include the Life Storage stores from July 20, 2023 forward. We operated 3,862 stores at September 30, 2024 compared to 3,651 stores at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Management Fees and Other Income Management fees and other income primarily represent the fees collected for our management of stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures and other transaction fee income. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to both an increase in the number of stores managed and an increase in the overall revenue of stores under management when compared to the same period last year. As of September 30, 2024, we managed 1,921 stores for unconsolidated joint ventures and third parties, compared to 1,755 stores as of September 30, 2023.

Expenses 
 The following table presents information on expenses for the periods indicated: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Expenses: Property operations 209,035 185,194 23,841 12.9 610,455 416,997 193,458 46.4 Tenant reinsurance 17,510 19,130 (1,620) (8.5) 55,646 37,701 17,945 47.6 Life Storage Merger transition costs 54,174 (54,174) (100.0) 54,174 (54,174) (100.0) General and administrative 39,750 37,406 2,344 6.3 123,373 107,011 16,362 15.3 Depreciation and amortization 195,046 152,338 42,708 28.0 586,821 309,914 276,907 89.3 Total expenses 461,341 448,242 13,099 2.9 1,376,295 925,797 450,498 48.7 
 
 Property Operations The increase in property operations expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists primarily of an increase of 174,964 related to the Life Storage Merger and acquisitions completed in the first nine months of 2024. The Life Storage Merger occurred on July 20, 2023; therefore the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the additional store count for the full quarter, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 only including the significantly increased store count from acquisition date forward. We acquired 771 wholly-owned stores in 2023 and an additional 20 wholly-owned stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 there was an increase of 16,139 at our stabilized stores primarily due to property and casualty insurance, payroll, marketing, and property tax, partially offset by utilities. 
 
 Tenant Reinsurance Tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. The increase is largely due to the number of stores operated during each period. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the larger store count from the Life Storage Merger for the entire respective periods, while the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 only include those stores from July 20, 2023 forward. We operated 3,862 stores at September 30, 2024 compared to 3,651 stores at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Life Storage Merger Transitions Costs Represents the costs that were incurred as part of the Life Storage Merger in July 2023 that did not meet the definition of transaction costs and primarily consist of severance paid as part of employment agreements with certain employees and officers of Life Storage. 
 
 General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores, including corporate payroll, office expense, office rent, travel and professional fees. These expenses are recognized as incurred. Our overall General and Administrative expense has increased primarily as a result of our increased size through acquisitions, business combinations and growth through our joint venture partners and managed portfolio. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. We acquired 771 wholly-owned stores in 2023 (757 wholly-owned stores in the Life Storage Merger on July 20, 2023) and an additional 20 wholly-owned stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result, depreciation expense was higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the increase relates to the amortization of intangibles recorded as part of the Life Storage Merger.

Other Revenues and Expenses 
 The following table presents information on other revenues and expenses for the periods indicated: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Loss on real estate assets held for sale (8,961) (8,961) 100.0 (63,620) (63,620) 100.0 Interest expense (142,855) (122,899) (19,956) 16.2 (412,875) (289,370) (123,505) 42.7 Non-cash interest expense related to amortization of discount on Life Storage unsecured senior notes (11,005) (8,228) (2,777) 33.8 (32,563) (8,228) (24,335) 295.8 Interest income 34,947 22,092 12,855 58.2 89,746 62,607 27,139 43.3 Equity in earnings and dividend income from unconsolidated real estate entities 16,246 15,043 1,203 8.0 48,508 38,602 9,906 25.7 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and sale of a joint venture interest 13,730 13,730 100.0 13,730 13,730 100.0 Impairment of Life Storage trade name (51,763) (51,763) 100.0 (51,763) (51,763) 100.0 Income tax expense (10,857) (6,944) (3,913) 56.4 (27,443) (17,238) (10,205) 59.2 Total other revenues expenses, net (160,518) (100,936) (59,582) 59.0 (436,280) (213,627) (222,653) 104.2 
 
 Loss on real estate assets held for sale As of September 30, 2024, we had 17 stores classified as held for sale. Of the 17 stores, nine had an estimated fair value, net of selling costs, less than the carrying value of the assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded estimated losses of 8,961 and 63,620, respectively. 
 
 Interest Expense The increase in interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of higher outstanding debt and a higher weighted average interest rate compared to the same period in the prior year. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 11.8 billion in total face value of debt, compared to approximately 11.3 billion as of September 30, 2023. The total face value of debt as of September 30, 2023 reflected an additional 3.7 billion of debt issued in connection with closing the Life Storage Merger on July 20, 2023. 
 
 Non-cash Interest Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Life Storage Unsecured Senior Notes Represents the amortization of the discount assigned to the fair value of the Life Storage unsecured senior notes assumed as part of the Life Storage Merger. 
 
 Interest Income Interest income represents interest earned on variable interest rate bridge loans, debt securities and on notes receivable from Common and Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders. The increase in interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase in the amount of bridge loans outstanding combined with an increase in interest rates. The balance of bridge loans was 1,032,244 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 533,000 as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Equity in Earnings and Dividend Income from Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. In these joint ventures, we and our joint venture partners generally receive a preferred return on our invested capital. To the extent that cash or profits in excess of these preferred returns are generated, we receive a higher percentage of the excess cash or profits. We added a total of 154 stores to new and existing joint ventures (145 stores from the Life Storage Merger) during 2023. These additional joint ventures have contributed to the increase. Dividend income represents dividends from our investment in preferred stock of SmartStop Self Storage REIT, Inc. and Strategic Storage Trust VI, Inc. 
 
 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures - Gain on Sale of Real Estate Assets In August 2024, the ESS Bristol Investments LLC joint venture sold five of its eight stores to another of our unconsolidated joint ventures, and we recognized a gain of 10,324 for our pro rata share of the transaction. In September 2024, we sold our membership interest in the Alan Jathoo JV LLC unconsolidated joint venture, which held nine stores, to our partner and recognized a gain of 3,406 on the transaction. 
 
 Impairment of Life Storage Trade Name During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we decided to operate all stores under a single brand. As a result of that decision, we deemed the Life Storage trade name intangible asset to be impaired and recognized a loss for the full value of the asset. 

36 

Income Tax Expense The increase in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase in book income and a decrease in permanent tax deductions related to stock awards. 
 
 FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS 
 
 Funds from operations FFO provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. We believe FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings. Net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe FFO more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. 
 
 The following table presents the calculation of FFO for the periods indicated: 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income attributable to common stockholders 193,210 188,350 592,194 587,064 Adjustments: Real estate depreciation 154,573 121,635 462,162 265,268 Amortization of intangibles 28,160 21,270 85,581 29,049 Loss on real estate assets held for sale 8,961 63,620 Unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization 7,922 6,698 23,771 16,359 Unconsolidated joint venture gain on sale of real estate assets (13,730) (13,730) Distributions paid on Series A Preferred Operating Partnership units (159) Income allocated to Operating Partnership noncontrolling interests 9,735 10,506 30,237 35,982 Funds from operations attributable to common stockholders and unit holders 388,831 348,459 1,243,835 933,563

SAME-STORE RESULTS 
 
 Our same-store pool for the periods presented consists of 1,075 stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80 or more for one calendar year. We believe that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to: occupancy, rental revenue growth, operating expense growth, net operating income growth, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole. The following table presents operating data for our same-store portfolio.

CASH FLOWS 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased when compared to the same period in the prior year. Cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to our acquisition and development of new stores, sales of stores, investments in unconsolidated real estate entities notes receivable from bridge loans, and fluctuate depending on our actions in those areas. Cash flows from financing activities depend primarily on our debt and equity financing activities. A summary of cash flows along with significant components are as follows: 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,479,151 1,037,959 Net cash used in investing activities (877,503) (1,636,052) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (612,406) 723,479 Significant components of net cash flow included: Net income 622,431 623,046 Depreciation and amortization 586,821 309,914 Loss on real estate assets held for sale 63,620 Impairment of Life Storage trade name 51,763 Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities 63,726 117,940 Acquisition and development of real estate assets (461,633) (263,866) Life Storage Merger, net of cash acquired (1,182,411) Investment in unconsolidated real estate entities (7,175) (179,258) Issuance and purchase of notes receivable, net of principal payments (585,731) (137,198) Proceeds from sale of notes receivable 175,335 134,064 Proceeds from unsecured term loans and senior notes and revolving lines of credit 5,542,362 5,194,665 Principal payments on unsecured term loans and senior notes and revolving lines of credit (6,062,896) (4,617,755) Proceeds from issuance of public bonds, net 1,000,000 950,000 Dividends paid on common stock (1,031,044) (704,069) 
 
 We believe that cash flows generated by operations, along with our existing cash and cash equivalents, the availability of funds under our existing lines of credit, and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months. These cash needs include operating expenses, monthly debt service payments, recurring capital expenditures, acquisitions, funding for the bridge loan program, building redevelopments and expansions, distributions to unit holders and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. 
 
 We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2024, and we consider projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds under our existing lines of credit, curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 88,931 available in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. During 2024 and 2023, we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 11,827,208 face value of debt, resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of 22.8 . As of September 30, 2024, the ratio of total fixed-rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 78.3 9,256,376 total fixed-rate debt including 1,382,568 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixed-rate debt). The weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed- and variable-rate debt at September 30, 2024 was 4.5 . Certain real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. We are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. We were in compliance with all financial covenants at September 30, 2024. 

40 

We expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of Operating Partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit. In addition, we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs and growth assumptions. 
 
 We hold a BBB+/Stable rating from S P, which was upgraded from BBB/Stable in July 2023 in connection with the Life Storage Merger, and a Baa2 rating from Moody's Investors Service. We intend to manage our balance sheet to maintain these ratings. Certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 1,705 unencumbered stores as defined by our public bonds. Our unencumbered asset value was calculated as 29,442,214 and our total asset value was calculated as 34,958,852 according to the calculations as defined by our public bonds. 
 
 Our liquidity needs consist primarily of operating expenses, monthly debt service payments, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders and distributions to unit holders necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. We may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt, shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional funds. We may also use Operating Partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners. 
 
 On April 15, 2024, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement with certain sales agents and forward purchasers named therein. Under the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, we may issue and sell, and the forward purchasers may sell, from time to time through or to the sales agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 800 million. The shares of common stock will be offered pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-278690) previously filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, filed with the SEC. As of September 30, 2024, no shares have been sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement, which we refer to as our "at the market" equity program. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 Except as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities, nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships. 

SEASONALITY 
 
 The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 

41 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future income, cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 11.8 billion in total face value of debt, of which approximately 2.6 billion was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). If SOFR was to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable-rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 25.7 million annually. 
 Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 (1) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 We have a disclosure committee that is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining our disclosure obligations on a timely basis. The disclosure committee meets quarterly and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 
 (2) Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

42 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings and are subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. We could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period, notwithstanding the fact that we are currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against us. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the Risk Factors section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 None. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
 
 None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 
 Not Applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers or directors , modified or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
