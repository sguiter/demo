 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 From time to time we make statements concerning our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance and underlying assumptions and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. You can generally identify our forward-looking statements by the words anticipate, believe, can, continue, could, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, intend, may, might, objective, outlook, plan, potential, predict, projection, seek, should, target, trend, will, would or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. 
 We have based our forward-looking statements on beliefs and assumptions based on information available to us at the time the statements are made. We caution you that assumptions, beliefs, expectations, intentions and projections about future events may, and often do, vary materially from actual results. Therefore, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. 
 The following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, including forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other factors described under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K of ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 15, 2024 2023 Form 10-K ), and in other reports we file from time to time with the SEC: 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 Our current and potential customers may reduce spending on sales, marketing, recruiting and other technology and information as a result of weaker economic conditions, which could harm our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows; 
 We may be unable to attract new customers, renew existing subscriptions, expand existing subscriptions, and collect revenue from our customers, which could harm our revenue growth and profitability; 
 If we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate, comprehensive, or reliable data, we could experience reduced demand for our products and services and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition; 
 Larger, well-funded companies with significant resources may shift their existing business models to become more competitive with us; 
 We experience competition from other companies and technologies that allow companies to gather and aggregate sales, marketing, recruiting, and other data, and competing products and services could provide greater appeal to customers; 
 The markets in which we compete are rapidly evolving, which make it difficult to forecast demand for our services; 
 Our platform integrates or otherwise works with third-party systems that we do not control; 
 Our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other traffic-generating arrangements; 
 We depend on our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of or inability to attract, integrate and retain these and other highly skilled employees could harm our business; 
 If we fail to maintain, upgrade, or implement adequate operational and financial resources, including our IT systems, we may be unable to execute our business plan; and 
 We may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, services, databases, and technologies into our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

 Risks Related to Privacy, Technology, and Security 
 Changes in laws, regulations, and public perception concerning data privacy, or changes in the patterns of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could impact our ability to efficiently gather, process, update, and/or provide some or all of the information we currently provide or the ability of our customers and users to use some or all of our products or services; 
 We may be subject to litigation for any of a variety of claims, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition; 
 New or changing laws and regulations may diminish the demand for our platform, restrict access to our platform, constrain the range of services we can provide, or require us to disclose or provide access to information in our possession, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition; 
 We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary and intellectual property rights in our data or technology; 
 Investing in our artificial intelligence AI capability introduces risks, which, if realized, could adversely impact our business; 
 Third-parties could use our products and services in a manner that is unlawful or contrary to our values or applicable law; 
 Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition; and 
 Technical problems or disruptions that affect our customers ability to access our services could damage our reputation and brands and lead to reduced demand for our products and services, lower revenues, and increased costs. 
 Risks Related to Credit and Financial Factors 
 We generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform and data, and any decline in demand for the types of products and services we offer would negatively impact our business; 
 Our failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations; 
 Downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals are not immediately reflected in full within our results of operations; 
 We anticipate increasing operating expenses in the future, and we may not be able to maintain profitability; 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to raise additional capital and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations; 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness; 
 Interest rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition; 
 Changes in our credit and other ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability; 
 Global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business, cash flows, or financial results. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed significant changes to the international tax law framework in the form of the Pillar Two model rules which seek to implement a global minimum tax. The potential effects of Pillar Two may vary depending on the specific provisions and rules implemented by each country that adopts Pillar Two; 
 Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results; and 
 Changes in tax laws or regulations in the various tax jurisdictions we are subject to that are applied adversely to us or our paying customers could increase the costs of our products and services and harm our business.

 Risks Related to Geopolitical Factors 
 Operations and sales outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations; and 
 Global economic uncertainty and catastrophic events, including global pandemics, continued hostilities such as those between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, Israel and Iran, and other conflicts in the Middle East, have and may disrupt our business and adversely impact our business and future results of operations and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure and Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 Our corporate structure and our tax receivable agreements may restrict our ability to make certain payments, increase the costs to consummate certain transactions, and limit our ability to realize the value of certain tax attributes; and 
 The parties to our stockholders agreement have special rights and interests that may conflict with ours or yours in the future. 
 These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, investments, or other strategic transactions we may make. 
 You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law.

 million. The Company reassesses the adequacy of the allowance each reporting period. 
 The assessment of variable consideration to be constrained is based on estimates, and actual consideration may vary from current estimates. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known. Changes in variable consideration are recorded as a component of net revenue. 
 Contract assets represent a contractual right to consideration in the future. Contract assets are generated when contractual billing schedules differ from revenue recognition timing.

Amortization expense related to these capitalized commissions is included in Sales and marketing on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Commissions payable at September 30, 2024 were million, of which the current portion of million was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the long-term portion of million was included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 reporting unit. 
 We first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount or elect to bypass such assessment. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative test by determining the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. 
 Acquired technology, customer relationships, trade names or brand portfolios, and other intangible assets are related to historical acquisitions (refer to Note 5 - Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets). Acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period over which we expect to realize economic value related to the intangible asset. The amortization periods generally range from years to years. Any costs incurred to renew or extend the life of an intangible or long-lived asset are reviewed for capitalization. 
 impairment charges relating to acquired goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets were recorded for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of million and million, respectively, to reduce the carrying values of our existing right-of-use assets associated with our Ra anana, Waltham, Vancouver, and Grand Rapids offices. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of million and million, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of the right-of-use assets associated with certain of our office spaces.

 Tax Receivable Agreements TRA or TRAs with certain non-controlling interest owners (the TRA Holders ). The TRAs generally provide for payment by the Company to the TRA Holders of of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that the Company actually realizes or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances. The Company will retain the benefit of the remaining of these net cash savings. 
 We account for amounts payable under the TRA in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies . Amounts payable under the TRA are accrued by a charge to income when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is estimable. TRA related liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the expected date of payment and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets under the captions Current portion of tax receivable agreements liability and Tax receivable agreements liability, net of current portion, respectively. Subsequent changes to the measurement of the TRA liability are recognized on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of Other income, net . Refer to Note 13 - Tax Receivable Agreements for further details on the TRA liability. 
 . Incentive awards may be in the form of various equity-based awards such as restricted stock and restricted stock units, and common stock options. 
 Compensation expense for incentive awards is measured at the estimated fair value of the incentive units and is included as compensation expense over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award. Compensation expense for performance-based restricted stock units is measured at the estimated fair value of the units and is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the service period when it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. Compensation expense for market-based restricted stock units is measured at the estimated fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which requires the use of various assumptions, including the stock price volatility and risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date corresponding to the length of time remaining in the performance period. This expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the service period and is not reversed if the market condition is not met.

 The derivative interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Consequently, the change in the estimated fair value of the effective portion of the derivative is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to Interest expense, net , when the underlying transaction has an impact on earnings. The Company expects to recognize approximately million of net pre-tax gains from accumulated other comprehensive income as a reduction of interest expense in the next twelve months associated with its interest rate swap. 
 Refer to the Company s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for amounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings related to the Company s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedging instruments for each of the reporting periods. 
 Foreign Currency Hedges 
 We are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates, primarily relating to changes in the Israeli Shekel. Consequently, from time to time, we may use foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company engaged in foreign currency forward contract activities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have settled forward currency contracts with a cumulative notional amount of million and million respectively. These transactions resulted in an immaterial gain due to favorable changes in the foreign currency. At September 30, 2024, our derivative financial instruments consisted of foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional value of million with maturities extending to December 2024. 
 The derivative foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Consequently, the change in the estimated fair value of the effective portion of the derivative is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to revenue or operating expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction, when the underlying transaction has an impact on earnings. Impacts on Cash and cash equivalents are presented as operating cash flows on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the period contracts are settled.

 The Company has elected to use the income approach to value the interest rate derivatives using observable Level 2 market expectations at measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount (discounted) reflecting current market expectations about those future amounts. Level 2 inputs for the derivative valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (specifically futures contracts) and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (specifically SOFR cash and swap rates, implied volatility for options, caps and floors, basis swap adjustments, overnight indexed swap OIS short term rates and OIS swap rates, when applicable, and credit risk at commonly quoted intervals). Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient for most fair value measurements. Key inputs, including the cash rates for very short-term, futures rates and swap rates beyond the derivative maturity, are interpolated to provide spot rates at resets specified by each derivative (reset rates are then further adjusted by the basis swap, if necessary). Derivatives are discounted to present value at the measurement date at SOFR rates unless they are fully collateralized. Fully collateralized derivatives are discounted to present value at the measurement date at OIS rates (short-term OIS rates and long-term OIS swap rates). 
 Inputs are collected from SuperDerivatives, an independent third-party derivative pricing data provider, as of the close on the last day of the period. The valuation of the interest rate swaps also take into consideration estimates of our own, as well as our counterparty s, risk of non-performance under the contract.

Currently, the maximum number of shares that can be purchased by an eligible employee under the ESPP is shares per offering period and there are offering periods that begin in the second and fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The purchase price for one share of common stock under the ESPP is currently equal to of the fair market value of one share of common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or the purchase date, whichever is lower. 
 The maximum aggregate number of shares of the common stock that may be issued under the ESPP is no more than shares (the ESPP Plan Share Reserve ). The ESPP plan also contains a provision that will add an additional number of shares of common stock to the ESPP Plan Reserve on the first day of each year starting with January 1, 2021, equal to the lesser of (i) the positive difference between (x) of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, and (y) the ESPP Plan Share Reserve on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, and (ii) a lower number of shares of common stock as may be determined by the Board.

 Recent Developments 
 Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Our business and financial condition have and may continue to be impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions. See Risk Factors - Geopolitical Risks in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of the possible impact of these issues on our business. 
 Waltham Lease Restructuring 
 In July 2024, the Company executed an agreement to restructure its existing lease commitments in Waltham, Massachusetts. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company made a payment of 59.1 million. The Company also executed a new lease agreement for separate office space in Waltham, Massachusetts with the same landlord, with rent payments expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2025. The lease will terminate on December 31, 2038. See Note 11 - Leases for further information regarding these agreements. 
 Accelerated Share Repurchase 
 In August 2024, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR Transaction with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate 125.0 million of the Company s common stock. The Company repurchased and retired in total 12,431,216 shares for 125.0 million at an average price of 10.06 per share as part of the ASR Transaction. See Note 1 - Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that the growth and future success of our business depends on many factors, including the following: 
 Acquiring New Customers 
 We are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers using our platform in the United States and around the world, and efficiently transacting with those customers. Acquiring new customers while optimizing the profile of those customers and the go-to-market channels we use to attract these customers will play a part in determining our operating results and growth prospects in the future. Acquiring new customers also strengthens the power of our contributory networks. We plan to continue to invest in our efficient go-to-market effort to expand our customer base.

Table of Contents 

 Increasing Usage of Our Platform 
 We believe that expanding the value that we provide to our customers and the corresponding revenue generated as a result is an important measure of the health of our business. We monitor net revenue retention to measure that growth. Net revenue retention is a metric that we calculate based on customers of ZoomInfo at the beginning of the twelve-month period, and is calculated as: (a) the total annual contract value ("ACV") for those customers at the end of the twelve-month period, divided by (b) the total ACV for those customers at the beginning of the twelve-month period. Our net revenue retention rate was 85 as of September 30, 2024. In the near term, we expect our net retention rate to be impacted by macroeconomic conditions. See section "Recent Developments - Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions." Over the long term, we expect our net revenue retention rate to be influenced by our ability to move upmarket, as larger customers have historically exhibited higher net revenue retention. We also measure our success in expanding relationships with existing customers by the number of customers that contract for more than 100,000 in ACV. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,809 customers with over 100,000 in ACV. 
 
 Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations 
 Our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factor impacting the comparability of our results of operations. 
 Changing the Mix of Our Customer Base and Reducing Write-offs and Bad Debts 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we deployed a new business risk model to flag and require upfront pre-payment from prospects at the greatest risk of non-payment. This process was incorporated to mitigate the risk of future write-offs and invest in the long-term health of the Company. Concurrently, our efforts have shifted to customers more likely to pay, renew, and grow with us over time. 
 As a result, we recorded an incremental charge during the second quarter of 2024 impacting our reported Revenue and General and administrative expenses . The charge represents a revision to our reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable, made up primarily of historical transactions with our SMB customers from 2023. 
 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We derive primarily all of our revenue from subscription services and the remainder from recurring usage-based services and other revenue. Our subscription services consist of our SaaS applications. Pricing of our subscription contracts are generally based on the functionality provided, the number of users that access our applications, and the amount of data that the customer integrates into their systems. Our subscription contracts typically have a term ranging from one to three years and are non-cancelable. We typically bill for services in advance either annually, semi-annually, or quarterly, and we typically require payment at the beginning of each annual, semi-annual, or quarterly period. 
 Subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term starting with when our service is made available to the customer. Recurring usage-based revenue is recognized in the period services are utilized by our customers. Other revenue, comprised largely of implementation and professional services fees, is recognized as services are delivered. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. We record a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings to date for that contract.

Table of Contents 

 Unearned revenue results from cash received or amounts billed to customers in advance of revenue recognized upon the satisfaction of performance obligations. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size, and contract timing within the period. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. 
 Cost of service 
 Cost of service, excluding amortization of acquired technology. Cost of service, excluding amortization of acquired technology, includes direct expenses related to the support and operations of our services and research teams including salaries, benefits, equity-based compensation, and related expenses, such as employer taxes, allocated overhead for facilities, technology, third-party hosting fees, third-party data costs, and amortization of internally developed capitalized software. 
 We anticipate continued investment in cost of service, with cost of service as a percentage of revenue expected to remain consistent or modestly increase. This is driven by rising AI consumption costs and customer onboarding expenses as we migrate existing customers to Copilot and acquire and onboard new Copilot customers. 
 Amortization of acquired technology. Amortization of acquired technology includes amortization expense for technology acquired in business combinations. 
 We anticipate that amortization of acquired technology will increase if we make additional acquisitions in the future. 
 Gross profit and Gross margin 
 Gross profit is revenue less cost of service, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including leveraging economies of scale, the costs associated with third-party hosting services and third-party data, the level of amortization of acquired technology, and the extent to which we expand our customer support and research organizations. We expect that our gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors. 
 Operating expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and amortization of other acquired intangibles. The most significant component of our operating expenses is personnel costs, which consists of salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, equity-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits. Operating expenses also include overhead costs for facilities, technology, professional fees, depreciation and amortization expense, marketing, and restructuring and transaction-related expenses. We anticipate that restructuring and transaction-related expenses, including potential impairments, will be influenced by future acquisition activity, strategic restructuring activities, and the commencement of new leases. Specifically, as new leases commence, we may face increased impairment expenses for spaces that we do not intend to occupy and/or that we plan to sublease, which could cause these costs to vary, potentially significantly, from our historic levels. Refer to Note 11 - Leases for further information. 
 Sales and marketing . Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee compensation such as salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, equity-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits for our sales and marketing teams, as well as overhead costs, technology, and marketing programs. Sales commissions and related payroll taxes directly related to contract acquisition are capitalized and recognized as expenses over the estimated period of benefit.

Table of Contents 

 We anticipate that we will continue to invest in sales and marketing capacity to enable future growth. We anticipate that sales and marketing expense excluding equity-based compensation as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of our growing investments in sales and marketing capacity excluding equity-based compensation, the recognition of revenue, and the amortization of contract acquisition costs. 
 Research and development. Research and development expenses support our efforts to enhance our existing platform and develop new software products. Research and development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation such as salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation, and other employee-related benefits for our engineering and product management teams, as well as overhead costs. Research and development expenses do not reflect amortization of internally developed capitalized software. We believe that our core technologies and ongoing innovation represent a significant competitive advantage for us. 
 We anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and development in order to develop new features and functionality to drive incremental customer value in the future and that research and development expense as a percentage of revenue will modestly increase in the short-term, but will modestly decrease in the long-term as we drive efficiencies in that organization. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs such as salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation, and other employee related benefits for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, IT, and business operations and administrative teams, as well as overhead costs. Additionally, we incur expenses related to bad debt and collections, as well as for professional fees including legal services, accounting, banking, and other consulting services. General and administrative expenses also include restructuring and transaction-related expenses, such as impairment charges associated with our leasing activity. Refer to Note 11 - Leases for further information. We also incur charges associated with litigation settlements, such as the Class Action settlement previously disclosed, which are presented within General and administrative on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate during periods when we incur non-recurring restructuring and transaction-related expenses, such as those associated with acquisitions or impairments. Excluding these non-recurring items, we expect a more stable or declining trend over time. 
 Amortization of other acquired intangibles . Amortization of acquired intangibles consists of amortization of customer relationships and brand portfolios. 
 We anticipate that amortization of other acquired intangibles will increase if we make additional acquisitions in the future. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net represents the interest payable on our debt obligations and the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, less interest income. 
 We anticipate that interest expense could be impacted by changes in variable interest rates, the issuance of additional debt, or changes in our interest rate hedging strategies, such as entering into new hedging arrangements or the expiration of existing interest rate swaps. 
 Loss on debt modification and extinguishment 
 Loss on debt modification and extinguishment consists of prepayment penalties and impairment of deferred financing costs associated with the modification or extinguishment of debt, as well as new fees incurred with third parties in connection with debt modifications. 
 We anticipate that losses related to debt modification and extinguishment will only occur if we extinguish indebtedness before the contractual repayment dates or amend our existing financing arrangements.

Table of Contents 

 Other income, net 
 Other income, net consists primarily of the revaluation of TRA liabilities, investment income, and foreign currency realized and unrealized gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency. 
 Changes to existing tax law including changes to the corporate income tax rates and the Company s state tax footprint could lead to substantial revaluations of the TRA liability recorded through Other income, net . Additionally, the magnitude of Other income, net may increase as we expand operations internationally and add complexity to our operations. Refer to the Provision for income taxes section below for further information. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future deductible temporary differences, net operating losses and credits by assessing the carryforward period and adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversing taxable temporary differences, future growth, and forecasted earnings, as well as historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
 The Company has significant U.S. deferred tax assets, including deferred tax assets created by various historical restructuring events. The preponderance of our deferred tax assets have long lives or are otherwise indefinite. We regularly review whether it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will be realizable. As of September 30, 2024, a valuation allowance continues to be recorded against certain state-level attributes. 
 The value of our deferred tax assets are regularly remeasured to consider the impact of statutory changes and other guidance, as well as changes in our state income apportionment factors. Given the amount of our deferred tax assets, minor changes can materially affect our Provision for income taxes . A significant portion of our deferred tax assets are associated with our TRA, and upon a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets, the TRA liability is typically concurrently remeasured with a partially offsetting impact within Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 We have regularly taken tax positions, including with respect to our various corporate events and restructurings in the ordinary course of determining our Provision for income taxes . We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits. We regularly review our tax positions with consideration of a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our Provision for income taxes in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe certain non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. These measures include, but are not limited to, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income and are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources, internal planning and forecasting, and for business strategy purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors because it eliminates certain items that affect period-over-period comparability, and it provides consistency with past financial performance and additional information about our underlying results and trends by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. 
 We view Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income as operating performance measures. We believe that the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to Adjusted Operating Income is U.S. GAAP operating income. We believe that the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to Adjusted Operating Income Margin is U.S. GAAP operating income divided by U.S. GAAP revenue. We believe that the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income is U.S. GAAP Net Income. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. This information should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are limitations to these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items or events being adjusted. In addition, other companies may use different measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, and Adjusted Net Income 
 We define Adjusted Operating Income as income (loss) from operations adjusted for, as applicable, (i) the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue, (ii) amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangibles, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) restructuring and transaction-related expenses, (v) integration costs and acquisition-related expenses, and (vi) legal settlement. We exclude the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue and amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangibles, as well as equity-based compensation, because these are non-cash expenses or non-cash fair value adjustments and we believe that excluding these items provides meaningful supplemental information regarding performance and ongoing cash-generation potential. We exclude restructuring and transaction-related expenses, as well as integration costs and acquisition-related compensation, because such expenses are episodic in nature and have no direct correlation to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis. We have also excluded charges associated with the litigation settlement related to the Class Actions previously disclosed because we believe it represents an extraordinary litigation expense outside of our ordinary course of business and is not indicative of our operative performance. Adjusted Operating Income is presented because it is used by management to evaluate our financial performance and for planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, we believe that it and similar measures are widely used by securities analysts and investors as a means of evaluating a company s operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of operating performance. 
 We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) adjusted for, as applicable, (i) the impact of fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue, (ii) loss on debt modification and extinguishment, (iii) amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangibles, (iv) equity-based compensation expense, (v) restructuring and transaction-related expenses, (vi) integration costs and acquisition-related expenses, (vii) legal settlement, (viii) TRA liability remeasurement (benefit) expense, (ix) other (income) loss, net and (x) tax impacts of adjustments to net income (loss). Adjusted Net Income is presented because it is used by management to evaluate our financial performance and for planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, we believe that it and similar measures are widely used by securities analysts and investors as a means of evaluating a company s operating performance. Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance.

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Management further adjusts EBITDA to exclude certain items of a significant or unusual nature, as applicable, including other (income) expense, net, loss on debt modification and extinguishment, impact of certain non-cash items, such as fair value adjustments to acquired unearned revenue and equity-based compensation, restructuring and transaction-related expenses, integration costs and acquisition-related compensation, and legal settlement. We exclude these items because these are non-cash expenses or non-cash fair value adjustments, which we do not consider indicative of performance and ongoing cash-generation potential or are episodic in nature and have no direct correlation to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it is used by management to evaluate our financial performance and for planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, we believe that it and similar measures are widely used by securities analysts and investors as a means of evaluating a company s operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance.

 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 118.0 million, a decrease of 13.1 million, or 10 , relative to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the lower revenues in the current period as described above. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 329.9 million, a decrease of 56.7 million, or 15 , relative to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the change in accounting estimate of collectibility of accounts receivable resulting in both reduced revenues as well as increased bad debt expense. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 147.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and 250.0 million available under our first lien revolving credit facility. We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and financed various acquisitions through cash generated from operations supplemented with debt offerings. 
 We believe that our cash flows from operations and existing available cash and cash equivalents, together with our other available external financing sources, will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. We are currently in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreements governing our secured credit facilities, and we expect to remain in compliance with our covenants. 
 We generally invoice our subscription customers annually, semi-annually, or quarterly in advance of our subscription services. Therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from such prepayments, which are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as unearned revenue. Unearned revenue consists of billed fees for our subscriptions, prior to satisfying the criteria for revenue recognition, which are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of September 30, 2024, we had unearned revenue of 419.2 million, of which 417.0 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 
 Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability, and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to obtain additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and to fund our capital requirements are dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which would result in additional expenses or dilution. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Cash flows from operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 260.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of net income of 14.5 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of 335.5 million and the net change in our operating and liabilities of 89.6 million. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of equity-based compensation of 104.2 million, depreciation and amortization of 63.3 million, asset impairments and lease abandonment charges of 57.4 million, amortization of deferred commission costs of 49.5 million, provision for bad debt expense of 39.3 million, a decrease in deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 11.0 million, and TRA remeasurement of 9.9 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 64.7 million, an increase in deferred costs and other assets of 30.4 million, a decrease in unearned revenue of 22.6 million, an increase in prepaid and other current expenses of 21.1 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of 17.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 69.7 million. 
 Net cash provided by operations was 306.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of net income of 112.8 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of 330.5 million and the net change in our operating assets and liabilities of 137.2 million. The non-cash charges are primarily comprised of equity-based compensation of 126.9 million, a decrease in deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 68.5 million, depreciation and amortization of 60.5 million, amortization of deferred commission costs of 57.2 million, and provision for bad debt expense of 22.0 million, partially offset by TRA remeasurement of 13.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in deferred costs and other assets of 53.0 million, a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 27.6 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 17.7 million, a decrease in unearned revenue of 16.8 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of 15.2 million. 
 We may make future acquisitions as part of our business strategy which may require the use of capital resources and drive additional future restructuring and transaction-related cash expenditures as well as integration and acquisition-related compensation cash costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we incurred the following cash expenditures:

 (1) Represents cash payments directly associated with acquisition or disposal activities, including employee severance and termination benefits, contract termination fees and penalties, and other exit or disposal costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these payments related primarily to Waltham lease restructuring charges. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, these payments related primarily to a June 2023 reduction in force, legal costs paid related to 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, and Waltham sublease costs. 
 (2) Represents cash payments directly associated with integration activities for acquisitions and acquisition-related compensation, which includes transaction bonuses and retention awards. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these payments related to deferred compensation from the acquisition of Insent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, these payments related to retention compensation from the Insent acquisition.

Table of Contents 

 Future demands on our capital resources associated with our debt facilities may also be impacted by changes in reference interest rates and the potential that we incur additional debt in order to fund additional acquisitions or for other corporate purposes. Future demands on our capital resources associated with transaction expenses and restructuring activities and integration costs and transaction-related compensation will be dependent on the frequency and magnitude of future acquisitions and restructuring and integration activities that we pursue. As part of our business strategy, we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses from time to time; however, we cannot predict the magnitude or frequency of such acquisitions or investments. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.8 million, primarily consisting of maturities of short-term investments of 82.2 million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets of 41.5 million and payments of initial direct costs of 3.4 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 11.1 million, consisting of purchases of short-term investments of 145.0 million, purchases of property and equipment and other assets of 17.6 million, offset by maturities of short-term investments of 151.5 million. 
 As we continue to grow and invest in our business, we expect to continue to invest in property and equipment and opportunistically pursue acquisitions. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 596.8 million and primarily comprised of payments relating to the repurchase of common stock of 542.6 million, TRA payments of 31.6 million, and payments of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of 18.1 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 266.6 million, comprised of payments relating to the repurchase of common stock of 247.0 million, payments of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of 17.0 million, repayment of debt of 4.5 million, payments of debt issuance and modification costs of 2.7 million, and payments of deferred consideration of 0.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of 4.6 million, and proceeds from exercise of stock options of 0.4 million. 
 Refer to Note 6 - Financing Arrangements of our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to each of our borrowings. 
 Debt Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate remaining balance of 650.0 million of 3.875 Senior Notes is due, in its entirety, at the contractual maturity date of February 1, 2029. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears beginning on August 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a remaining balance of 589.6 million with respect to its first lien term loans. The Company is obligated to make principal payments each quarter in the amount of 0.25 of the aggregate outstanding amount as of the latest amendment, with the remaining balance due at the contractual maturity date of February 28, 2030. The foregoing currently represent the only existing required future debt principal repayment obligations that will require future uses of the Company s cash. 
 The first lien term debt has a variable interest rate whereby the Company can elect to use a Base Rate or SOFR plus an applicable rate. The applicable rate is 0.75 for Base Rate loans or 1.75 for SOFR loans. The effective interest rate on the first lien debt was 7.24 and 7.83 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 In addition, the credit agreement governing our first lien term loan contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. These restrictive covenants include, among others, limitations on our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock, prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt, make acquisitions, investments, loans, and advances, or sell or otherwise dispose of assets. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our debt. The Company may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the credit agreements governing our first lien term loan limit, but do not prohibit, the Company from incurring additional indebtedness, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions will also not prevent the Company from incurring obligations that do not constitute Indebtedness as defined in the agreements governing our indebtedness. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures increased by 23.9 million, or 136 , to 41.5 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of increased expenditures related to new facilities and increased capitalization of development expenses.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a liability of 2,794.9 million related to its projected obligations under the TRA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 31.6 million was paid to TRA holders pursuant to the TRA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, no payment was made pursuant to the TRA. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had additional operating leases for office space that have not yet commenced with anticipated undiscounted future lease payments of 72.6 million. In July 2024, the Company executed a termination agreement with the landlord. Pursuant to the amended lease agreement with respect to Waltham, Massachusetts, the Company made a payment of 59.1 million. Refer to Note 11 - Leases of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Except as set forth above and in Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations and commitments disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates are those accounting policies and estimates that are both the most important to the portrayal of our net assets and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the nature of the estimates is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial condition or operating performance is material. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We have operations in the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. 
 Inflation 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material direct effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions, including underlying factors such as inflation. See Risk Factors - Geopolitical Risks in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of the possible impact of these issues on our business. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset higher costs through price increases and our inability or failure to do so could potentially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our operating results are subject to market risk from interest rate fluctuations on our first lien term loan, which bears a variable interest rate based on SOFR. As of September 30, 2024, the total principal balance outstanding was 589.6 million. We have implemented a hedging strategy to mitigate the interest rate risk by entering into certain derivative instruments (refer to Note 6 - Financing Arrangements of our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). Based on the outstanding balances and interest rates of our debt as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical relative increase or decrease in our effective interest rate by 100 basis points or 1 would have caused an immaterial corresponding change over the next 12 months. 
 Additionally, from time to time, we have dedesignated certain cash flow hedging relationships due to repricing of the terms and partial prepayment of the outstanding principal of our first lien term loan since loan inception. As of September 30, 2024, all cash flow hedging relationships are designated as accounting hedges. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 To date, our sales contracts have primarily been denominated in U.S. dollars. We have foreign entities established in Israel, Canada, United Kingdom, India, and Australia. The functional currency of these foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. A stronger U.S. dollar could make our solution more expensive outside the United States and therefore reduce demand, while a weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. Such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of currency fluctuations. 
 To manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk and to reduce the volatility associated with the fluctuation of foreign currencies, we may use foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments from time to time. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company initiated a foreign currency hedging program (see Note 7 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities). This program aimed to mitigate potential adverse effects on our financial results from significant currency movements. 
 Monetary assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are re-measured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the reporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses are re-measured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded to Other income, net . Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above, currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations or our hedging activities will not be material in the future.

 Credit Risk 
 Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. We hold cash with reputable financial institutions that often exceed federally insured limits. We manage our credit risk by concentrating our cash deposits with multiple high-quality financial institutions and periodically evaluating the credit quality of those institutions. The carrying value of cash approximates fair value. Our investment portfolio is comprised of highly rated securities with a weighted-average maturity of less than 12 months in accordance with our investment policy which seeks to preserve principal and maintain a high degree of liquidity. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Interim Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures were developed through a process in which our management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 You will also be eligible to receive future equity awards under the OIP at a level appropriate for your seniority and performance as may be determined from time to time by the Company and the Board at their discretion. Any such equity awards will be subject to the due execution of appropriate agreements in a form acceptable to, and approved by, the Company. 
 Compensation Benefits Connected to Termination By the Company Without Cause and Termination By the Employee For Good Reason Where Termination Is Not Connected to Change in Control 
 The Company is confident you will excel in this position. However, if, absent a Change in Control, for any reason your employment with the Company is involuntarily terminated without Cause or you terminate for Good Reason (each as defined below), the Company will, after due execution of a separation agreement and release of claims on a form specified by the Company in its sole discretion, pay you a cash lump sum equivalent to 50 of your then-current base salary on the date of your termination as well as an additional cash lump sum approximately equivalent to six (6) months of company-paid major medical plan premiums provided you were enrolled in a Company-sponsored major medical healthcare plan on the date of your termination. For clarity, should your termination occur during the period in which you are operating in your capacity as interim Chief Financial Officer, we will consider the base salary for the purposes of the calculation to be 450,000. Should a termination even occur after the date you are confirmed in the role, or the date you return to Vice President, FP&A, the base salary will be the annual salary you are paid at the time of the notification date. In either case, the overlay would be removed. 
 In addition, provided you execute and do not revoke the separation agreement and release of claims, the Company will accelerate any unvested time-based RSUs that would otherwise have become vested within 90 days of your termination date, up to a maximum of 500,000 in fair market value as of the date of acceleration. 
 For purposes of a Termination Without Cause and Not Connected to a Change in Control, Cause shall mean 
 
 (i) Willful failure to perform your duties, including, but not limited to, cooperation in any investigation or formal proceeding as is required by your role and relationship with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) 
 (ii) Willful failure to comply with any valid, legal, and ethical directive of the Company 
 
 (iii) Engagement in dishonesty, illegal conduct, or gross misconduct, which is, in each case, injurious to the Company or its affiliates 
 (iv) Embezzlement, misappropriation, or fraud, whether or not related to your employment with the Company 
 
 (v) Conviction of or plea of guilty or no contest to a crime that constitutes a felony or a crime that constitutes a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude 
 (vi) Violation of a material policy of the Company 
 
 (vii) Willful unauthorized disclosure of Trade Secrets or Confidential Information (as defined below) 

805 Broadway St, Suite 900, Vancouver, WA 98682 800.914.1220 zoominfo.com 

(viii) Material breach of any material obligation under this appointment letter or any other written agreement between you and the Company or 
 (ix) Any material failure by you to comply with the Company s written policies or rules, as they may be in effect from time to time during the your employment term. 
 The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the at will nature of your employment. Except for a failure, breach, or refusal which, by its nature, cannot reasonably expected to be cured, you shall have thirty (30) business days from the delivery of written notice by the Company within which to cure any acts constituting Cause provided, however, that, if the Company reasonably expects irreparable injury from a delay of thirty (30) business days, the Company may give you notice of such shorter period within which to cure as is reasonable under the circumstances, which may include the termination of your employment without notice and with immediate effect. 
 For purposes of a Termination For Good Reason and Not Connected to a Change in Control, Good Reason shall exist in the event of (i) a material diminution in your current base salary amount or target bonus opportunity (other than as contemplated by this appointment letter), (ii) a material change or diminution in your authority, duties or responsibilities (other than as contemplated by this offer letter), (iii) a material change in geographic location at which you are required to perform services, or (iv) any material breach by the Company of your RSU agreement or any other stock award agreement.. In such case, you will be entitled to terminate your employment for Good Reason within thirty 
 (30) days of the existence of such circumstance. If you do not terminate your employment for Good Reason within thirty (30) days of the initial existence of such grounds, then you will have waived your right to terminate for Good Reason with respect to such grounds. 
 Termination in Connection with a Change in Control Within 12 Months Following the Change in Control Event 
 
 You are eligible for certain benefits in the event of your termination of employment in connection with a Change in Control. Change in Control is defined in the OIP. If within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control, (i) you are involuntarily terminated without Cause (as defined in the ZoomInfo 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan), or (ii) you resign for Good Reason (as defined above), all unvested RSUs, options, and all other equity awards that are unvested shall become fully vested upon the date of your Termination. 
 The Company will pay you a cash lump sum equal to 75 of your base salary, twelve (12) months of company-paid major medical coverage, and the greater of (i) 100 of your eligible short-term incentive amount or (ii) 100 of the average of the last two years of the earned short-term incentive amount. For clarity, should your termination occur during the period in which you are operating in your capacity as interim Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, we will consider the base salary for the purposes of the calculation to be 450,000. Should a termination event occur after the date you are confirmed in the role, or the date you return to the role of Vice President, FP&A, we will consider the base salary to be the greater of (i) your salary in effect at the time of the Change in Control, or (ii) the base salary at time of the termination or determination of Good Reason. 
 In addition, provided you execute and do not revoke the separation agreement and release of claims, the Company will accelerate 100 of any unvested RSUs that would otherwise have become vested. Any performance-based RSUs or performance share units will accelerate and vest 100 , provided the terms and conditions of the award agreements for those awards permit acceleration of the entire award in the event of termination connected to change in control. Should the award agreements provide for a different acceleration amount, schedule, or conditions for acceleration upon a Change of Control, the award agreement language for each specific award will control.

Receipt of any of the equity acceleration, cash payment, and other benefits related to termination in connection with a Change in Control are contingent upon your due execution of a lawful separation agreement and release of claims on a form specified by the Company in its sole discretion as long as it is done so in good faith. 
 In the event the Company adopts a Change in Control and executive severance plan in the future or a similar type arrangement in which you are eligible to participate, your participation will be the greater of (i) the benefit and compensation levels provided in this appointment letter, or (ii) the benefits and compensation described in the new plan and participant agreement. If the new plan and participant agreement are more generous, upon due execution of that plan, the terms and conditions related to benefits and severance payments described in this appointment letter are void. 
 You will continue to participate in all other ZoomInfo benefits and programs. You remain a participant in ZoomInfo s Flexible Time Off (FTO) policy for all exempt and salaried non-exempt employees. ZoomInfo s Flexible Time Off policy is offered with the understanding that employees should take the time off they need when they need it. Additionally, ZoomInfo offers a Sick Leave policy, which will be prorated in your first year of employment. Employees will be granted an additional 52 hours of sick leave in January of each year. More information on our FTO and Sick Leave policy can be found in the Employee Handbook. 
 You will continue to be eligible for and participate in, as you elect, our Health, Vision, and Dental Insurance available through Regence, VSP, and Delta Dental. You will be eligible for medical, dental, and vision coverage. You continue to be eligible to contribute to ZoomInfo's 401(k) on the first day of the month following the date of hire with a 50 match on the first 7 of contribution, vesting over 3 years. We also offer the following benefits HSA, Dependent Care FSA, Life Insurance, AD&D, Short Term & Long-Term Disability Insurance, and Pet Insurance. 
 Your employment at the Company will be at-will. This means that you are free to resign at any time with or without cause or prior notice. Similarly, the Company is free to terminate our employment relationship with you at any time, with or without cause or prior notice. Although your job duties, title, compensation, benefits, and the Company s policies and procedures may change from time-to-time, the at-will nature of your employment may only be changed in a document signed by you and the CEO of the Company. Your employment with the Company is subject to ZoomInfo s general employment policies, many of which are described in the ZoomInfo Employee Handbook. 
 By accepting the appointment terms described in this letter, you acknowledge and agree that any materials shared with you that are designated as confidential by ZoomInfo prior to your Start Date are confidential and that you will maintain the confidentiality of such materials and not make any disclosure of such materials or any information contained therein to any third party. In the event of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of such materials of information, you agree to promptly notify ZoomInfo. 
 Please contact me if you have any questions whatsoever about this letter or your employment. We are looking forward to you continuing to work with us as a member of the ZoomInfo team.
