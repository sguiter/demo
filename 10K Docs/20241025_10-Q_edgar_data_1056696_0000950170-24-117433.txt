In the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2024. Remaining Performance Obligations As of September 30, 2024 , approximately billion of revenue - over of which is cloud-native subscriptions - is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations (RPO) with a non-cancelable term greater than 1 year (including deferred revenue as well as amounts that are expected to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods). of these remaining performance obligations over the next with the majority of the remaining balance recognized over the following 36 months. We have elected not to provide disclosures regarding remaining performance obligations for contracts with a term of 1 year or less. Returns and Allowances We have not experienced significant returns or warranty claims to date and, as a result, have not recorded a provision for the cost of returns and product warranty claims. We record an allowance for credit losses utilizing a model of internal historical losses data. In estimating the allowance for credit losses, we considered our historical write-offs, the historical creditworthiness of the customer, and other factors. We also analyzed expected credit losses given future risks in projected economic conditions and future risks of customer collection. Should any of these factors change, our estimates will also change accordingly, which could affect the level of our future allowances. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are recorded in general and administrative expense and were immaterial in all periods presented. Our credit loss reserve was million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We also reduce accounts receivable with a corresponding reduction in services revenue for the most likely amount of potential service revenue adjustments based on a detailed assessment of accounts receivable. The total amount recorded to services revenue was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and

million and million, respectively, for these potential adjustments. Deferred Commissions We consider sales commissions to be incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. We defer and recognize an asset for sales commissions related to performance obligations with an expected period of benefit of more than one year. We amortize these amounts over the expected benefit period, which we estimate by considering several factors, including the rate of technological change and duration of our customer contracts. Sales commission for renewal contracts are amortized over the related contractual renewal period. Deferred commissions were million as of September 30, 2024, of which million is included in other assets and million is included in prepaid expenses. Sales commission expense is included in Sales and Marketing expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Amortization of sales commissions was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million fo r the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. impairment losses were recognized during the periods.

For money market funds, we use quoted prices from active markets that are classified at Level 1, the highest level of observable input in the disclosure hierarchy framework. We had investments classified at Level 2 or Level 3 at September 30, 2024 .

The increase in the effective tax rate for three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to a decrease of benefit in recording return to provision estimates in the quarter,

million primarily due to statute of limitations expiration. We conduct business globally and, as a result, file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, Manhattan is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal, substantially all state and local income tax examinations and substantially all non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2010. Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, we are subject to a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases, net of stock issuances, beginning in 2023. We have included the tax in the cost of our stock repurchases as a reduction of shareholders' equity.

geographic reportable segments: North and Latin America (the Americas Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific (APAC). All segments derive revenue from the sale and implementation of our supply chain commerce solutions. The individual products sold by the segments are similar in nature and are all designed to help companies manage the effectiveness and efficiency of their supply chain commerce. We use the same accounting policies for each reportable segment. The chief operating decision maker (Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) evaluate performance based on revenue and operating results for each reportable segment. The Americas segment charges royalty fees to the other segments based on software licenses and cloud subscriptions sold by those reportable segments. The royalties, which totaled approximately million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in costs of revenue for each segment with a corresponding reduction in the Americas segment s cost of revenue. The revenues represented below are from external customers only. The geography-based costs consist of costs for professional services personnel, direct sales and marketing expenses, infrastructure costs to support the employee and customer base, billing and financial systems, management and general and administrative support. Certain corporate expenses included in the Americas segment are not charged to the other segments. Such expenses include research and development, certain marketing and general and administrative costs that support the global organization, and the amortization of acquired developed technology. Costs in the Americas segment include all research and development costs, including the costs associated with our operations in India.

I tem 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this quarterly report. We also recommend the following discussion be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis and consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted in such forward-looking statements, for a variety of factors. See Forward-Looking Statements below. 
 References in this filing to the Company, Manhattan, Manhattan Associates, we, our, and us refer to Manhattan Associates, Inc., our predecessors, and our wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Business Overview 
 We develop, sell, deploy, service and maintain software solutions designed to manage Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain, inventory and omnichannel operations for retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, logistics providers and other organizations. Our customers include many of the world s most premier and profitable brands. 
 Our business model is singularly focused on the development and implementation of complex commerce enablement software solutions that are designed to optimize supply chains, and retail store operations including point-of-sale effectiveness and efficiency for our customers. 
 We have five principal sources of revenue: 
 cloud subscriptions, including software as a service (SaaS); 

licenses of our software; 

customer support services and software enhancements (collectively, maintenance 

professional services, including solutions planning and implementation, related consulting, customer training, and reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses (collectively, services and 

hardware sales. 

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 266.7 million and 786.6 million in total revenue, respectively. The revenue mix for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was: cloud subscriptions 33 ; software license 1 ; maintenance 13 ; services 51 ; and hardware 2 . The revenue mix for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was: cloud subscriptions 31 ; software license 1 ; maintenance 13 ; services 52 ; and hardware 3 . 
 We have three geographic reportable segments: North and Latin America (the Americas ), Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific (APAC). Geographic revenue is based on the location of the sale. Our international revenue was approximately 88.0 million and 260.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which represents approximately 33 of our total revenue for both three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. International revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the United States. At September 30, 2024, we employed approximately 4,700 employees worldwide. We have offices in Australia, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as representatives in Mexico and reseller partnerships in Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia. 
 Future Expectations 
 While we remain cautious about the global economy, our results for the first nine months of 2024 exceeded our expectations due to solid demand for our cloud solutions. Our solutions are mission critical, supporting complex global supply chains. We believe that favorable secular tailwinds, such as the digital transformation of businesses in manufacturing, wholesale and retail, coupled with our commitment to investing in organic innovation to deliver leading cloud supply chain, inventory and omnichannel commerce solutions is in synergistic alignment with current market demand. We believe that this alignment is contributing to our strong financial results, higher demand and strong win rates for our solutions for the period. We remain committed to investing in our business to drive customer success and expand our total addressable market, which we believe will position us well to achieve long-term sustainable growth and earnings. 
 Going forward, we are investing in our cloud business, including enterprise investments in innovation, and strategic operating expenses to support growth objectives. 
 For the remainder of 2024, our five strategic goals remain to: 
 Focus on employees, customer success and drive sustainable long-term growth; 

Invest in innovation to expand our products and total addressable market; 

14 

Expand our Manhattan Active Suite of Cloud Solutions; 

Develop and grow our cloud business and cloud subscription revenue; and 

Expand our global sales and marketing teams. 

Cloud Subscription 
 Under our Manhattan Active Solutions cloud subscription offering, customers pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software within a cloud environment that we provide and manage over a specified period of time. Adoption of our Manhattan Active cloud solutions continues to increase, with cloud revenue up 33 over the same quarter in the prior year. Cloud revenue now represents about 96 of our total software revenue. Customers on our legacy perpetual license program can convert their maintenance contracts to cloud subscription contracts. 
 Global Economic Trends and Industry Factors 
 Global macro-economic trends, technology spending, and supply chain management market growth are important barometers for our business. In both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 67 of our total revenue was generated in the United States, 18 in EMEA, and the remaining balance in APAC, Canada, and Latin America. In addition, Gartner Inc. Gartner ), an information technology research and advisory company, estimates that approximately 79 of every supply chain software solutions dollar invested is spent in North America and Western Europe; consequently, the health of the U.S. and the Western European economies have a meaningful impact on our financial results. 
 We sell technology-based solutions with total pricing, including software and services, in many cases exceeding 1.0 million. Our software is often a part of our customers and prospects much larger capital commitment associated with facilities expansion and business improvement. We believe that, given the mission critical nature of our software, combined with a challenging global macro environment, our current sales cycles for large cloud subscriptions in our target markets could be extended. While demand for our solutions is solid, the current business climate within the United States and geographic regions in which we operate may affect customers and prospects decisions regarding timing of strategic capital expenditures. 
 While we are encouraged by our results, we remain cautious regarding the pace of global economic growth. We believe global geopolitical and economic volatility likely will continue to shape customers and prospects enterprise software buying decisions. 
 Key Performance Metrics 
 We regularly review metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe cloud subscriptions revenue growth and remaining performance obligation (RPO) growth are the leading indicators of our business performance, primarily derived from cloud subscription fees that customers pay for our Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions. 
 Cloud Subscriptions Revenue Growth 
 Our cloud revenue growth provides insight into our ability to maintain and grow our cloud customer base. Total cloud revenue increased to 246.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 183.2 million for the same period in the prior year, representing a 35 year-over-year increase. Cloud revenue growth is being driven by strong demand for our cloud offerings. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Transaction price allocated to RPO represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable amounts that we expect to invoice and recognize as revenue in future periods. Over 98 of our RPO represent cloud native subscriptions with a non-cancelable term greater than one year. Maintenance contracts typically are for one year and not included in RPO. RPO provides insight into our contracted backlog of future business. As of September 30, 2024, our RPO was approximately 1.7 billion, an increase of 27 over September 30, 2023 on strong demand. 
 Revenue 
 Cloud Subscriptions and Software License Revenue. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, cloud subscriptions revenue totaled 86.5 million or 33 of total revenues. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments recognized 67.7 million, 16.2 million, and 2.6 million in cloud subscriptions revenue, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cloud subscriptions revenue was 96 of total cloud and software license revenue. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cloud subscriptions revenue totaled 246.9 million or 31 of total revenues. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments recognized 193.5 million, 46.0 million, and 7.4 million in cloud subscriptions revenue, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cloud subscriptions revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement, typically five years or more. Cloud subscription revenue growth is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products. These revenues generally have long sales cycles.

In the three months ended September 30, 2024, license revenue totaled 3.8 million, or 1 of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments totaled 3.1 million, 0.3 million, and 0.4 million in license revenue, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, license revenue totaled 9.6 million, or 1 of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments totaled 7.4 million, 1.1 million, and 1.1 million in license revenue, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 14 and 22 , respectively, of the total value of new non-cancelable cloud subscriptions (excluding renewals) signed was with new customers, and 86 and 78 , respectively, was with existing customers. We define new customers as entities from which we either have never earned revenue or have not recognized revenue in the last five years. 
 Our Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions are focused on core omnichannel operation (e-commerce, retail store operations and POS), supply chain commerce operations (Warehouse Management, Transportation Management and Labor Management), and Inventory Optimization, which are intensely competitive markets characterized by rapid technological change. We are a market leader in the supply chain management and omnichannel software solutions market as defined by industry analysts such as ARC Advisory Group and Gartner. Our goal is to extend our position as a leading global supply chain solutions provider by growing our cloud subscriptions revenue faster than our competitors through investment in innovation. 
 Maintenance Revenue. Our maintenance revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 34.5 million, or 13 of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA and APAC segments recognized 27.6 million, 4.7 million, and 2.2 million, respectively, in maintenance revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, maintenance revenue totaled 104.7 million, or 13 of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments totaled 84.0 million, 13.9 million, and 6.8 million in maintenance revenue, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For maintenance, we offer a comprehensive 24 hours per day, 365 days per year program that provides our customers with software upgrades, when and if available, which include additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives. 
 Maintenance relates to our traditional perpetual license sales. We expect maintenance revenues to decline as we continue to develop our cloud offerings, and be offset by additional cloud revenue, including from customers converting their maintenance contracts to cloud subscriptions. The growth of maintenance revenues is influenced by: (1) new software license revenue growth; (2) annual renewal of support contracts; and (3) fluctuations in currency rates. Substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts or convert their maintenance contracts to cloud subscriptions. Maintenance revenue is generally paid in advance and recognized over the term of the agreement, typically twelve months. Maintenance renewal revenue is recognized over the renewal period once we have a contract upon payment from the customer. 
 Services Revenue. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, our services revenue totaled 137.0 million, or 51 of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments recognized 102.6 million, 26.9 million, and 7.5 million, respectively, in services revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, services revenue totaled 406.0 million, or 52 of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments totaled 304.2 million, 80.2 million, and 21.6 million in services revenue, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our professional services organization provides our customers with expertise and assistance in planning and implementing our solutions. To ensure a successful product implementation, consultants assist customers with the initial implementation of a system or service, the conversion and transfer of the customer s historical data to the new system or service, and ongoing training, education, and system/service upgrades. We believe our professional services enable customers to implement our software rapidly, ensure the customer s success with our solutions, strengthen our customer relationships, and add to our industry-specific knowledge base for use in future implementations and product innovations. 
 Although our professional services are optional, the majority of our customers use at least some portion of these services for their planning, implementation, or related needs. Professional services are typically rendered under time and materials-based contracts with services typically billed on an hourly basis. Professional services are sometimes rendered under fixed-fee based contracts with payments due on specific dates or milestones. 
 Services revenue growth is contingent upon cloud sales and customer upgrade cycles, which are influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products. In addition, our professional services business has competitive exposure to offshore providers and other consulting companies. 
 Hardware Revenue. Our hardware revenue, which we recognize net of related costs, totaled 4.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 representing 2 of total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, hardware revenue totaled 19.3 million, or 3 of total revenue. As a convenience for our cloud and software customers, we resell a variety of hardware products developed and manufactured by third parties. These products include computer hardware, radio frequency terminal networks, RFID chip readers, bar code printers and scanners, and other peripherals. We resell all third-party hardware products and related maintenance pursuant to agreements with manufacturers or through distributor-authorized reseller agreements, pursuant to which we 
 16 

are entitled to purchase hardware products and services at discount prices. We generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer. As a result, we do not maintain hardware inventory. 
 Product Development 
 We continue to invest significantly in research and development (R D) to provide leading Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions to enable global retailers, manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and logistics providers to successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating demands as well as the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains, retail store operations and points of sale. Our R D expenses were 34.3 million and 104.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We expect to continue to focus our R D resources on the development and enhancement of our core supply chain, inventory optimization, omnichannel and point-of-sale software solutions. We offer what we believe to be the broadest solutions portfolio in the supply chain solutions marketplace, addressing all aspects of inventory optimization, transportation management, distribution management, planning, and omnichannel operations including order management, store inventory fulfillment, call center and point-of-sale. 
 We also plan to continue to enhance our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address evolving industry standards and market needs. We identify opportunities to further enhance our solutions and to develop and provide new solutions through our customer support organization, as well as through ongoing customer consulting engagements and implementations, interactions with our user groups, association with leading industry analysts and market research firms, and participation in industry standards and research committees. Our solutions address the needs of customers in various vertical markets, including retail, consumer goods, food and grocery, logistics service providers, industrial and wholesale, high technology and electronics, life sciences, and government. 
 Cash Flow and Financial Condition 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash flow from operating activities of 62.3 million and 190.3 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 totaled 215.0 million, with no outstanding debt. We currently have no credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash have been for funding investments in R D in our Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions to drive revenue and earnings growth. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 198.1 million of Manhattan Associates outstanding common stock under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved replenishing the Company s remaining share repurchase authority to an aggregate of 75.0 million of our common stock. 
 For the remainder of 2024, we expect our first priority for use of cash will continue to be investments in our Unified Omnichannel Commerce and Digital Supply Chain solutions. We also expect to prioritize capital allocation in our global teams to fund growth and share repurchases. We do not anticipate any borrowing requirements in 2024 for general corporate purposes.

We have three geographic reportable segments: the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Geographic revenue information is based on the location of sale. The revenues represented below are from external customers only. The geography-based expenses include costs of personnel, direct sales, marketing expenses, and general and administrative costs to support the business. There are certain corporate expenses included in the Americas segment that we do not charge to the other segments, including R D, certain marketing and general and administrative costs that support the global organization, and the amortization of acquired developed technology. Included in the Americas costs are all R D costs, including the costs associated with our operations in India. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we derived the majority of our revenues from sales to customers within our Americas segment.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased 1.0 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same quarter in the prior year primarily due to a 1.0 million decrease in bonus and commission expenses. 
 General and Administrative (G A). G A expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs of executive, financial, human resources, information technology, and administrative personnel, as well as facilities, legal, insurance, accounting, and other administrative expenses. G A expenses decreased slightly by 1.1 million , in the current year quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year, primarily due to a 0.9 million decrease in other taxes.

Other income, net. Other income, net primarily includes interest income, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-operating expenses. Other income, net decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in the prior year, due to an increase in foreign currency losses. We recorded net foreign currency losses of 0.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, and 0.4 million of net foreign currency gains in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Income tax provision. Our effective income tax rate was 16.5 and 10.4 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due a decrease of benefit in recording return to provision estimates in the quarter, offset by a reduction in expense related to statute of limitations expiration on uncertain tax positions.

Cloud Subscription Revenue. Cloud subscriptions revenue increased 63.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Customers have demonstrated a clear preference for cloud-based solutions, including existing customers that are migrating from on-premise to cloud-based offerings. Cloud subscriptions revenue for the Americas, EMEA and APAC segments increased 44.7 million, 16.6 million and 2.4 million, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Software License Revenue. Software license revenue decreased 3.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. We believe the decrease reflects a strong market preference for our cloud-native solutions. 
 The license sales percentage mix across our product suite in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was over 80 warehouse management solutions. 
 Maintenance Revenue. Maintenance revenue decreased 2.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Maintenance revenue for the Americas, EMEA and APAC segments decreased by 0.9 million, 1.0 million and 0.1 million respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Services Revenue. Services revenue increased 37.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Services revenue for the Americas, EMEA and APAC segments increased 28.6 million, 5.0 million and 3.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in cloud subscriptions. The percentage of professional services revenue that relates to cloud subscriptions in nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 74 and 67 , respectively. The remainder of our professional services revenue relates to implementations, ongoing support, and upgrades of licensed software. 
 Hardware Revenue. Hardware revenue increased 0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The majority of our hardware revenue is derived from our Americas segment. Sales of hardware is largely dependent upon customer-specific desires, which fluctuate.

Cost of Cloud Subscriptions, Maintenance and Services. Costs of cloud subscriptions, maintenance and services consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses of employees dedicated to cloud operations; maintenance services; and professional and technical services as well as hosting fees. The 34.0 million increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was principally due to a 32.2 million increase in compensation and other personnel-related expenses, a 3.3 million increase in computer infrastructure cost, a 1.0 million increase in facilities expense, and offset by a 2.6 million decrease in performance-based compensation expense. 
 Cost of Software License. Cost of software license consists of the costs associated with software reproduction; media, packaging and delivery; documentation, and other related costs; and royalties on third-party software sold with or as part of our products. Cost of software license remained relatively flat in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in the prior year.

 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased 1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a 2.2 million increase in compensation and other personnel related expenses, a 0.3 million increase in marketing and campaign programs, and offset by a 1.1 million decrease in performance-based compensation expense. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 3.2 million increase in compensation and other personnel related expenses, and offset by a 1.0 million decrease in other taxes, a 0.5 million decrease in performance-based compensation expense and 0.4 million decrease in computer costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization of intangibles and software expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.7 million and 4.2 million, respectively. 
 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 200.9 million compared to 151.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Operating margin was 25.5 the first nine months of 2024 versus 21.9 for the same period in the prior year. Operating income and margin increased primarily due to increased cloud and services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our cloud business continues to scale.

Other income, net. Other income, net increased 0.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a 0.7 million increase in interest income and a 0.5 million decrease due to foreign currency losses. The decrease driven by foreign currency losses is primarily due to gains or losses on intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies with subsidiaries due to the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee. We recorded net foreign currency losses of 1.5 million in the first nine months of 2024, and 0.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Income tax provision. Our effective income tax rate was 16.5 and 17.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to an increase of excess tax benefits on restricted stock vesting and a reduction in expense related to statute of limitations expiration on uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a decrease of benefit in recording return to provision estimates. 
 
 23 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we funded our business exclusively through cash generated from operations. Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 included 115.2 million held in the U.S. and 99.8 million held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our cash balances in the U.S. are sufficient to fund our U.S. operations. In the future, if we elect to repatriate the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, we would not be subject to additional U.S. income taxes on such earnings, but we could be subject to additional local withholding taxes. 
 Cash flow from operating activities totaled 190.3 million and 157.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Typical factors affecting our cash provided by operating activities include our level of revenue and earnings for the period, the timing and amount of employee bonus and income tax payments, and the timing of cash collections from our customers which is our primary source of operating cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 32.4 million compared to the same period in the prior year, which is primarily due to an increase in earnings and the timing of cash collections from our customers. 
 Cash flow used in investing activities totaled 5.5 million and 2.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our investing activities for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of capital spending to support company growth. 
 Cash flow used in financing activities totaled 241.2 million and 195.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The principal use of cash for financing activities in both periods was to purchase our common stock, including shares withheld for taxes due upon vesting of restricted stock. Repurchases of our common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 241.2 million and 195.7 million, respectively, including shares withheld for taxes of 43.0 million and 29.7 million , respectively. 
 Periodically, opportunities may arise to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary products, and technologies. Any material acquisition could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount, timing, and nature of the consideration to be paid. We believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs at least for the next twelve months, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. We continue to focus on managing liquidity, while investing in and growing our headcount capacity to support our customers and grow our business. For the remainder of 2024, we anticipate that our priorities for use of cash will be similar to prior years, with our first priority being continued investment in product development and profitably investing in our business to extend our market leadership. We will continue to weigh our share repurchase options against cash for acquisitions and investing in the business. We will also continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our product footprint and technology direction. At this time, we do not anticipate any borrowing requirements for the remainder of 2024 for general corporate purposes. 
 Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 Our principal commitments consist of multiple non-cancellable contracts for cloud infrastructure services and obligations under operating leases. As of September 30, 2024, our cloud infrastructure obligations are approximately 248.8 million over the next 6 years. We also enter into non-cancellable subscriptions in the ordinary course of business for internal software to support our operations. Our obligations, as of September 30, 2024, are approximately 25.3 million over the next 6 years. We expect to fulfill all these commitments from our working capital. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In the first nine months of 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
