CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Quarterly Report, contains, and management may make, certain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained
in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
terms such as believe, expect, intend, plan, may, 
 should, anticipate, could, might, seek, target, 
 will, project, forecast, continue or their negatives or variations of these
words or other comparable words. These statements include, without limitation, our statements about: our product candidates 
development, including the timing and design of the Phase 1 clinical trial of Decoy20; our expectations regarding the recommended
Phase 2 dose for subsequent multi-dosing and combination studies and related timing; our expectations and plans regarding our
clinical supply agreement with BeiGene and our plans to advance clinical evaluation of the combination of BeiGene s anti-PD-1
antibody, tislelizumab, with Decoy20; our plans to seek FDA approval and to initiate a combination trial, and the timing thereof;
the anticipated effects of our product candidates; our plans to develop and commercialize our product candidates; the market
potential and treatment potential of our product candidates, including Decoy20; our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing
capabilities and strategy; our expectations about the willingness of healthcare professionals to use our product candidates; our
general business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations; our research and development activities
and costs; our future results of operations and condition; the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to fund our ongoing
activities and our ability to continue as a going concern; and the impact of current macroeconomic conditions on our operations,
ability to access capital, and liquidity. 

The
forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions and are based largely on our current expectations and projections
about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and assumptions, including those described under the sections in this Quarterly Report entitled Summary Risk Factors, 
Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Because
forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some
of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events
and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties
may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. 

Except
as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as
a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. We intend the forward-looking statements contained
in this Quarterly Report to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

Summary
Risk Factors 

The
principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our common stock risky, include, among others: 

We
 are a clinical-stage company with a limited operating history. We are not currently profitable, do not expect to become profitable
 in the near future and may never become profitable. 

We
 have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as going concern. 

Given
 our lack of current cash flow, we will need to raise additional capital. If we are unable to raise a sufficient amount of capital
 when needed on acceptable terms or at all, we may be forced to delay, limit or eliminate some or all of our research programs, product
 development activities and commercialization efforts. 

Raising
 additional capital would cause dilution to our existing shareholders and may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish
 rights to our technologies or product candidates. 

Clinical
 and preclinical development involves lengthy and expensive processes with uncertain outcomes. Any difficulties or delays in the commencement
 or completion, or the termination or suspension, of our current or planned clinical trials could result in increased costs to us,
 delay or limit our ability to generate revenue or adversely affect our commercial prospects. 

We
 expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses and other operating expenses, which may make it difficult
 for us to attain profitability. 

We
 may expend our limited resources to pursue a limited number of research programs, product candidates and specific indications and
 fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of
 success. 

Our
 product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization
 or have other significant adverse implications on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The
 commercial success of our product candidates depends upon their market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and
 the medical community. 

We
 rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and perform other tasks. If these third parties do not
 successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able
 to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business, financial condition and results of operations
 could be substantially harmed. 

We
 currently rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates during clinical development, and expect to continue
 to rely on third parties for the foreseeable future. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient
 quantities of our product candidates, or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development
 or potential commercialization efforts. 

The
 successful commercialization of Decoy20 or any future product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which
 governmental authorities and health insurers establish coverage, adequate reimbursement levels and favorable pricing policies. Failure
 to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease
 our ability to generate revenue. 

iii 

Recently
 enacted legislation, future legislation and healthcare reform measures may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing
 approval for and commercialize Decoy20 and any future product candidates and may affect the prices we may set. 

If
 our competitors have product candidates that are approved faster, marketed more effectively, are better tolerated, have a more favorable
 safety profile or are demonstrated to be more effective than our product candidates, our commercial opportunity may be adversely
 affected. 

Any
 product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated. 

We
 may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary or licensed technology in the marketplace. 

We
 may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses. 

We
 are subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, which could increase compliance costs, and
 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our results of operations and financial condition. 

Actual
 or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements
 could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

A
 pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, may materially and adversely affect our business and operations. 

Our
 business and operations may suffer in the event of information technology system failures, cyberattacks or deficiencies in our cybersecurity. 

Maintaining
 and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s
 attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members. 

Unfavorable
 global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

The
 market price of our common stock is volatile and you may sustain a complete loss of your investment.

Notes
to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 

million, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of approximately million. In addition, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company used approximately 
million of cash in operations and expects to continue to incur significant cash outflows and incur future additional losses as clinical
trials and commercialization of the Company s product candidates will require significant additional financing. The Company believes
that, as of the date of the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, it has adequate cash to fund its
ongoing activities into the first quarter of 2025 based on its current operating plan. The Company plans to execute its operating plan
by obtaining additional capital, principally through entering into collaborations, strategic alliances, or license agreements with third
parties and/or additional public or private debt and equity financing, such as through the registered direct offering and concurrent
private placement that the Company completed in August 2024 (the August 2024 Offering ), raising a total of approximately
 million, net of placement agent and other offering expenses in the amount of approximately million. For more details see Note
6(c). However, there is no assurance that additional capital and/or financing will be available to the Company, and even if available,
whether it will be on terms acceptable to the Company or in the amounts required. If the Company is unsuccessful in securing sufficient
financing, it may need to delay, reduce, or eliminate its research and development programs, which could adversely affect its business
prospects, or cease operations. 

As
a result of these uncertainties, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classifications of assets and
liabilities that would result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.

such amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 

The
Company estimates the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model requires estimates of highly subjective assumptions, which affect the fair value of each stock option. The weighted
average inputs used to measure the value of the options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are presented in the
table below. The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was per share.

b. 
 On
 June 1, 2022, the Company entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement which was amended on
 September 1, 2022 with a sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through the sales agent,
 shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share. The issuance and sale of common stock by the Company under
 the ATM Agreement is being made pursuant to the Company s effective shelf 
 registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on September 1, 2022 and declared effective on September 9, 2022. In
 2024, the Company sold shares of the Company s common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million.
 The Company s ability to issue shares under the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 is limited by General Instruction
 I.B.6 to Form S-3. On August 6 , 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to reduce the
 amount of shares registered under the prospectus for the ATM to and to suspend the ATM program, but the ATM Agreement remains
 in full force and effect. 

c. 
 On
 August 8, 2024, the Company completed a registered direct offering, pursuant to which the Company sold and issued to certain

 In addition, in a concurrent private placement, the Company also issued to the purchasers in the August 2024 Offering unregistered
 warrants to purchase 
 shares of the Company s common stock (the PIPE Warrants ). The PIPE Warrants are immediately exercisable at an
 exercise price of per
 share and expire from the date of issuance. The total net proceeds were approximately 
 million, after deducting placement agent and other offering expenses in the amount of approximately 
 million. In September 2024, the Company filed a registration statement to register the resale by the investors of the shares
of common stock issuable upon exercise of the PIPE Warrants. The registration statement was declared effective on September 20, 2024.

Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 13, 2024

of this Quarterly Report. 

Overview 

We
are a clinical biotechnology company developing a novel and patented systemically-administered anti-cancer and anti-viral immunotherapy.
We have evolved from more than a century of immunotherapy advances. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that efficient activation
of both innate and adaptive immune cells and associated anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses will require a multi-targeted package
of immune system activating signals that can be administered safely intravenously. Our patented technology is composed of single strains
of attenuated and killed, non-pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria, designed to have reduced i.v. toxicity, but largely uncompromised ability
to prime or activate many of the cellular components of innate and adaptive immunity. This approach has led to broad anti-tumor and anti-viral
activity in preclinical models, including durable anti-tumor response synergy observed with each of four different classes of existing
agents, including NSAIDs, checkpoint therapy, targeted antibody therapy and low-dose chemotherapy. Tumor eradication by our technology
was associated with induction of both innate and adaptive immunological memory and, importantly, did not require provision of or targeting
a tumor antigen in preclinical models. We have carried out successful current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) manufacturing of our
lead clinical candidate, Decoy20. 

In
May 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, allowed us to proceed under our IND for a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients
with advanced solid tumors where currently approved therapies have failed. In December 2022, we initiated an open label, multi-center,
dose escalation and expansion, single arm (monotherapy) Phase 1 study conducted in 2 parts. The Phase 1 study began with single dose
administration and has now been followed with continuous weekly dosing of Decoy20 in tumor-specific expansion cohorts. The study is enrolling
patients with any one of six advanced/metastatic solid tumors, who have exhausted approved treatment options. The study s objectives
are to assess the safety and tolerability of Decoy20, to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the optimal biologically active and recommended
Phase 2 dose, as well as to assess Decoy20 pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and clinical activity. The primary endpoints of the
study are incidence, relatedness and severity of adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events and determining the number of subjects
per cohort with dose limiting toxicity-based adverse events. Secondary endpoints include the incidence of anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing
antibodies pre- and post-treatment, change in Decoy20 PK parameters over time, objective response rate and duration of response. 

In
August 2023, we evaluated the first four patients who received a single dose of 7 x 10 7 Decoy20 in Part 1 of the Phase 1 clinical trial.
All four patients who enrolled were evaluable in the first cohort. These patients experienced generally anticipated transient adverse
events including hemodynamic changes such as changes in pulse or blood pressure that resolved within 30 minutes and laboratory abnormalities
such as grade 1-3 elevations in transaminases (liver function tests) and grade 4 reductions in lymphocytes that generally resolved within
three days. One patient had a dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 bradycardia (slow heart rate) and grade 2 hypotension (low blood pressure)
which resolved within approximately 90 minutes with i.v. fluids. Patients also experienced transient induction of over 50 different biomarkers
associated with innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. After the end of infusion, Decoy20 was cleared from the blood within
30 to 120 minutes. Peak cytokine and chemokine induction occurred within ~4 to 24 hours and most cytokine/chemokines returned to the
patient s respective baseline by 24-72 hours. This rapid clearance and associated transient cytokine/chemokine induction are desired
to avoid prolonged toxicity, often associated with longer term cytokine exposure. 

In
September 2023, we began the second cohort of the Phase 1 clinical trial after receiving authorization from the Safety Review Committee.
The second cohort dose was a reduction from 7 x 10 7 Decoy20 dose to 3 x 10 7 Decoy20. In March 2024, we completed the second cohort
of patients who received a single dose of 3 x 10 7 Decoy20 in Part 1 of the clinical trial Patients on the second (lower dose) cohort
experienced adverse events similar in frequency and severity to the higher dose cohort with one dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 ALT
elevation that required one week to resolve. Pharmacodynamic effects included transient induction of multiple biomarkers. Clearance of
Decoy20 was similarly rapid. Following authorization from the Safety Review Committee, we advanced into the weekly dosing part of the
trial. 

In May and June 2024, we enrolled two additional patients in the first cohort who received a single dose of 7 x 10 7
Decoy20, and in August 2024 we received the authorization from the Safety Review Committee to initiate the weekly dosing with 7 x 10 7
Decoy20. 

As of October 2024, we completed one month of the weekly dosing part in the first six patients at the 3 x 10 7 Decoy20 dose and
following the review of the safety data by the Safety Review Committee we received the authorization to initiate unrestricted enrollment
of patients at the 3 x 10 7 Decoy20 dose. 

1 

In October 2024, we entered into a clinical supply agreement (the Supply Agreement with BeiGene Switzerland
GmbH BeiGene to advance clinical evaluation of Decoy20 in combination with BeiGene s anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab
(the BeiGene Product for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors (the Combination Study ). This
Combination Study builds on preclinical results where Decoy20, combined with a PD-1 inhibitor, demonstrated high tumor eradication rates
and established immunological memory. We intend to seek approval from the FDA to initiate the Combination Study, which is anticipated
to begin in 2025. 

Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, we will pay for all costs associated with the Combination Study (other than
the cost of the BeiGene Product), BeiGene will supply the BeiGene Product to us for the purposes of the study, and we will supply Decoy20
for the purposes of the Combination Study. The Supply Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the
date that we provide BeiGene with the Combination Study s final clinical study report or (ii) the date of termination of the Combination
Study, subject to early termination in certain circumstances. 

Impact
of Macroeconomic Conditions on our Operations 

Economic
developments such as inflation and interest rates have negatively affected the global financial markets and may reduce our ability to
access capital, which could negatively impact our short-term and long-term liquidity. The ultimate impact of current economic conditions
is highly uncertain and subject to change. While it is unknown how long these conditions will last and what the complete financial effect
will be to us, capital raise efforts and additional development of our technologies may be negatively affected. In addition, our business
operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics. 

Components
of Operating Results 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily
of fees paid to contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, as well as compensation
expenses for certain employees involved in the planning, managing, and analyzing the work of the CROs and CMOs and materials used for
research and development activities. We expense research and development costs as incurred. 

We
accrue expenses for manufacturing, preclinical studies and clinical trial activities performed by third parties based on estimates of
services received and efforts expended pursuant to agreements with CROs, CMOs, and other outside service providers. We determine these
estimates based on contracted amounts applied to the proportion of work performed and determined through analysis with internal personnel
and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services. In the event advance payments are made to a
CRO, CMO, or outside service provider, we record the payments as a prepaid asset, which will be amortized or expensed as the contracted
services are performed. However, actual costs and timing of these activities are highly uncertain, subject to risks and may change depending
upon a number of factors, including our clinical development plan. 

We
expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to ramp up our clinical
development activities and incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts.
Our expenditures on future nonclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to
completion. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials and development of product candidates will depend
on a variety of factors, including: 

the
 timing and receipt of regulatory approvals 

the
 scope, rate of progress and expenses of preclinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development activities 

potential
 safety monitoring and other studies requested by regulatory agencies and 

significant
 and changing government regulation. 

2 

The
process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain FDA and other regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and the
successful development of product candidates is highly uncertain. These risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development
projects are discussed more fully in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors - We expect to continue to incur significant research and
development expenses and other operating expenses, which may make it difficult for us to attain profitability . As a result
of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research
and development projects, or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our
product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses include compensation, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for executive management, finance administration
and human resources, facility costs (including rent), professional service fees, and other general overhead costs, including depreciation,
to support our operations. 

We
expect our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to support our research and development activities and operations generally, the growth of our business and, if any of our product candidates
receive marketing approval, commercialization activities. We also expect to continue to incur expenses as a result of operating as a
public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, additional director and officer insurance
expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services. 

Other
Income, Net 

Other
income, net includes interest earned on deposits and investments and other items of income, expense, gain and loss that are incidental
to the core operations of the Company.

Research
and Development Expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our research and development expenses were approximately 1.5 million, which represented
a decrease of approximately 0.7 million, or approximately 34 , compared to approximately 2.2 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. This decrease was attributable primarily to the development of our manufacturing processes of Decoy20 that were
conducted in the three months ended September 30, 2023. We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the
remainder of the year as our Phase 1 clinical trial progresses. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

Our
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to approximately 1.7 million, a decrease
of approximately 0.3 million, or approximately 17 , compared to approximately 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023. This decrease was attributable primarily to stock-based compensation, legal fees and recruitment costs. 

Other
Income, Net 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our other income, net was approximately 0.1 million, which represented a decrease of approximately
 0.2 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The other income generated in the period consists primarily of
income earned on the Company s cash and cash equivalent accounts, the balances of which were lower during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2023.

Research
and Development Expenses 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our research and development expenses were approximately 4.8 million, which represented a
decrease of approximately 0.8 million, or approximately 15 , compared to approximately 5.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. This decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease of approximately 1.1 million in the development of our
manufacturing processes of Decoy20 that were conducted in 2023 and was offset by an increase of approximately 0.3 million in our
Phase 1 clinical trial and in payroll and related expenses. We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the
remainder of the year as our Phase 1 clinical trial progresses. 

4 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

Our
 general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted
to approximately 6.4 million, a decrease of approximately 0.2 million, or approximately 3 , compared to approximately 6.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease of approximately 0.7 million in
legal fees, payroll and related expenses, recruitment costs and directors and officers insurance expenses, and was
offset by an increase of approximately 0.5 million in investor relations and business development expenses. 

Other
Income, Net 

During
the nine months ended September 30,
2024, our other income, net was approximately 0.3 million, which represented a decrease of approximately 0.5 million as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The other income generated in the period
consists primarily of income earned on the Company s cash and cash equivalent accounts, the balances of which were lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Resources 

We
do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. Since our inception, we have funded
our operations primarily through public and private offerings of our equity securities. 

On
August 8, 2024, we completed a registered direct offering, pursuant to which we sold and issued to certain investors, including an
officer of Indaptus, 1,643,837 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per share of 1.825. In addition, in a concurrent
private placement, we also issued to the purchasers in the August 2024 Offering unregistered warrants to purchase 1,643,837 shares
of our common stock (the PIPE Warrants ). The PIPE Warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of 1.70
per share and expire five years from the date of issuance. The total net proceeds were approximately 2.5 million, after deducting
placement agent and other offering expenses in the amount of approximately 0.5 million. 

In
June 2022, we entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement which was amended on September 1,
2022 with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC, as sales agent Wainwright ), pursuant to which we may offer and sell,
through Wainwright, shares of our common stock from time to time. The issuance and sale of common stock by us under the ATM
Agreement is being made pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on
September 1, 2022 and declared effective on September 9, 2022. In 2024, we sold 152,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate
gross proceeds of approximately 0.4 million. On August 6, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to reduce the amount of shares
registered under the prospectus for the ATM to 0.00 and to suspend the ATM program, but the ATM Agreement remains in full force and
effect. 

In
December 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park pursuant to which we have the
right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to 20.0 million of our common stock
(subject to certain limitations) from time to time over the term of the purchase agreement. We also filed a registration statement on
Form S-1 to cover the resale of shares of our common stock issuable under the purchase agreement. 

Upon
execution of the purchase agreement, we issued to Lincoln Park 142,450 initial commitment shares and are obligated to issue additional
shares of common stock to Lincoln Park with a value of 125,000, calculated in accordance with the purchase agreement, on the date we
have sold over 10.0 million in shares of common stock under the purchase agreement, up to a maximum of 76,220 shares of common stock
(to be appropriately adjusted for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar transaction), in each case as consideration for Lincoln Park s irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of our common
stock at our direction under the purchase agreement. Additionally, we have reserved up to 3,781,330 shares of our common stock for issuance
and sale to Lincoln Park under the purchase agreement from time to time, if and when we determine to sell additional shares to Lincoln
Park. No shares of common stock have been sold under the program. 

5 

We
believe that the cash and cash equivalents of approximately 7.4 million that we had as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund
our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2025. As of the date of this report, despite our best efforts, we have been unable to raise new
financing since the completion of the August 2024 registered direct offering and we do not have any committed arrangements in place
for future financing, other than as described above. We will need to increase our capital resources through equity or debt
financings, and we may need to do so sooner than we expect. We may also seek to finance our cash needs through collaborations,
strategic alliances, or license agreements with third parties. If sources of financing are available, they may result in substantial
dilution to our stockholders. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable
terms or in the amounts required, if at all. If we are unable to consummate a financing or other transaction, we may
need to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or cease
operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report. For additional information, see Note 1 to our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. 

We
have no ongoing material financing commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees, that are expected to affect our liquidity over
the next five years. 

Cash
Flows 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with net
cash used in operating activities of approximately 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease
resulted primarily from a decrease in our research and development activities and general and administrative expenses and by net
changes in operating asset and liability items. 

Investing
Activities 

There
was no net cash provided by or used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by investing
activities was approximately 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was related to the maturity of 24.0 million
in marketable securities, offset by net investment of approximately 6.9 million in marketable securities. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September
 30, 2024 was approximately 2.9 million, which was provided by issuance and sale of our
common stock under the ATM Agreement and issuance and sale of our common stock and warrants in the August 2024 Offering .
 There was no net cash provided by or used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Funding
Requirements 

Our
operating expenses are expected to continue to increase in the future in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we expect
to continue to ramp up our clinical development activities and incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support
our research and development efforts. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur
significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to
continue to incur significant costs associated with operating as a public company. 

We
believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 are
adequate to fund our ongoing activities into the first quarter of 2025. 

6 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 

the
 scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials 

the
 scope, prioritization and number of our clinical trials and other research and development programs 

the
 amount of revenues we receive under future licensing, collaboration, development and commercialization arrangements with respect
 to our product candidates 

the
 impact of any pandemic, epidemic or other future health crisis on our business and operations 

the
 costs of the development and expansion of our operational infrastructure 

the
 costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates 

the
 ability of us, or our collaborators, to achieve development milestones, marketing approval and other events or developments under
 our potential future licensing agreements 

the
 costs of filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights 

the
 costs and timing of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production 

the
 costs of contracting with third parties to provide sales and marketing capabilities for us or establishing such capabilities ourselves 

the
 costs of acquiring or undertaking development and commercialization efforts for any future products, product candidates or technology 

the
 costs associated with being a public company; and 

any
 cost that we may incur under future in- and out-licensing arrangements relating to one or more of our product candidates. 

Identifying
potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process
that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and
achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues,
if any, will be derived from sales of product candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available for the next couple of years,
if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. The trading prices for our and other biopharmaceutical
companies stock have been highly volatile as a result of current macroeconomic conditions and market volatility. As a result, we have faced and may continue to face difficulties raising
capital through sales of our common stock. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or in the amounts
required, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in
securing sufficient financing, we may need to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs, which could adversely
affect our business prospects, or cease operations. For additional information, see Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and Risk Factors in Part II. Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. 

Contractual
Obligations 

Operating
lease liabilities represent our commitment for future rent made under a non-cancelable lease for our offices in San Diego, CA. The total
future payments for our operating lease obligation on September 30, 2024 were approximately 0.1 million which is due through October
2025. For additional details regarding our lease, see Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in
this Quarterly Report. 

We
did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the SEC
rules.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

This
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities and expenses. Significant accounting
policies employed, including the use of estimates, are presented in the notes to our annual financial statements included in our 2023
Annual Report on Form 10-K. We periodically evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal
of our financial condition and results of operations and require our subjective or complex judgments, resulting in the need to make estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual performance should differ from historical experience or if the underlying
assumptions were to change, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted. 

Our
critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those discussed in our 2023 Annual Report
on Form 10-K. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standard 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ,
which sets forth improvements to the current segment disclosure requirements in accordance with Topic 280 Segment Reporting, 
including clarifying that entities with a single reportable segment are subject to both new and existing segment reporting requirements.
ASU 2023-07 will be effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2024. Adoption of this ASU is currently being evaluated. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09
requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income
taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item 3. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply
judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of September 30,
2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Part
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 

There
are currently no pending material legal proceedings, and we are currently not aware of any legal proceedings or claims against us or
our property that we believe will have any significant effect on our business, financial position or operating results. None of our officers
or directors is a party against us in any legal proceeding. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

You
should carefully consider the factors described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report,
including the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report beginning
on page F-1, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business,
financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our
common stock to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks
Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements 

We
have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
have incurred net losses and utilized cash in operations since inception as described above. In addition, as of September 30, 2024,
we had approximately 7.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, and during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we used
 8.9 million of cash in operations and expect to continue to incur significant cash outflows and incur future additional losses to
execute our operating plan. We believe that the cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our
operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2025. We will need to increase our capital
resources through equity or debt financings. We may also seek to finance our cash
needs through collaborations, strategic alliances, or license agreements with third parties and/or debt or equity financings. As of the date of this report, despite our best efforts, we have been unable to raise new financing since the completion
of the August 2024 registered direct offering and we do not have any committed arrangements in place for future financing, other than
as described above. If
sources of financing are available, they may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. We cannot provide any assurance
that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or in the amounts required, if at all. Due to the
uncertainty in securing additional funding, and as existing cash resources are not sufficient to fund planned operations for at
least 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly Report, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to
continue as a going concern. If we are unsuccessful in securing sufficient financing, we may need to delay, reduce, or eliminate our
research and development programs, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or cease operations. 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report have been prepared on a going concern basis under
which an entity is able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments relating to the carrying values and classification of assets
and liabilities that would be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. 

Our
future operations are dependent upon the successful entry into collaborations, strategic alliances, or license agreements with third
parties and/or on the identification and successful completion of equity or debt financing and the achievement of profitable operations
at an indeterminate time in the future. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in completing these collaborations or alliances,
equity or debt financing or in achieving profitability. As such, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going
concern. 

Substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock, and
it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing. If potential collaborators decline to do business with us or potential investors
decline to participate in any future financing due to such concerns, our ability to increase our cash position may be limited. The perception
that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability
to meet our contractual obligations. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, you could lose all or part of your investment in
our Company. 

Given
our lack of current cash flow, we will need to raise additional capital. If we are unable to raise a sufficient amount of capital when
needed in required amounts and on acceptable terms or at all, we may be forced to delay, limit or eliminate some or all of our research
programs, product development activities and commercialization efforts. 

Since
we will be unable to generate sufficient, if any, cash flow to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, we will need to seek additional
equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations. 

There
can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. If such additional financing
is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available in sufficient amounts, we may be required to delay, limit or eliminate some
or all of our research programs, product development activities and commercialization efforts, and our ability to achieve our business
objectives, our competitiveness, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
In addition, we may be required to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and
market ourselves. Our inability to fund our business could lead to the loss of your investment. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 

the
 scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials 

the
 scope, prioritization and number of our clinical trials and other research and development programs 

10 

the
 amount of revenues we receive under future licensing, collaboration, development and commercialization arrangements with respect
 to our product candidates 

the
 impact of any pandemic, epidemic or other future health crisis on our business and operations 

the
 costs of the development and expansion of our operational infrastructure 

the
 costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates 

the
 ability of us, or our collaborators, to achieve development milestones, marketing approval and other events or developments under
 our potential future licensing agreements 

the
 costs of filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights 

the
 costs and timing of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production 

the
 costs of contracting with third parties to provide sales and marketing capabilities for us or establishing such capabilities ourselves 

the
 costs of acquiring or undertaking development and commercialization efforts for any future products, product candidates or technology 

the
 costs associated with being a public company; and 

any
 cost that we may incur under future in- and out-licensing arrangements relating to one or more of our product candidates. 

Even
if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may continue to seek additional capital if market
conditions are favorable or in light of specific strategic considerations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on
acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding on a timely basis, in required amounts or on favorable terms,
we may be required to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our research or product development programs and/or commercialization
efforts. We may also be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on business opportunities as desired. Any of these events
could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business prospects. 

We
are a clinical-stage company with a limited operating history. We are not currently profitable, do not expect to become profitable in
the near future and may never become profitable. 

We
are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused primarily on developing a novel and patented systemically-administered anti-cancer
and anti-viral immunotherapy. All of our product candidates are in the preclinical or early clinical development stage, and none of our
product candidates have been approved for marketing or are being marketed or commercialized. 

As
a result, we have no meaningful historical operations upon which to evaluate our business and prospects and have not yet demonstrated
an ability to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates or successfully overcome the risks and uncertainties frequently
encountered by companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. As a result, we have not been profitable and have incurred significant operating
losses in every reporting period since our inception. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we reported a net loss of approximately
 10.9 million and as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 56.3 million. 

For
the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to incur losses, which will increase significantly from historical levels as we expand
our development activities, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, and begin to commercialize them if they are approved
by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, or comparable foreign authorities. Further, the net losses we incur may fluctuate
significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not
be a good indication of our future performance. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more product candidates,
we may never become profitable, or even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent
periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders 
equity and working capital. 

Raising
additional capital would cause dilution to our shareholders and may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our
technologies or product candidates. 

Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity
and/or debt financings and collaborations, licensing agreements or other strategic arrangements. We may seek additional capital through
a combination of private and public equity offerings, at-the-market issuances, equity-linked and structured transactions,
debt (straight, convertible, or otherwise) financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional
capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include
liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a shareholder. For example, in June 2022, we entered into an at
the market offering agreement, which was amended on September 1, 2022, with a sales agent pursuant to which, based on the prospectus
supplement that was filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024, we may offer and sell from time to time shares of our common stock from time
to time. On August 6, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to reduce the amount
of shares registered under the prospectus for the ATM to 0.00 and to suspend the ATM program, but the ATM Agreement remains in full force
and effect. Additionally, in December 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park Capital
Fund, LLC (Lincoln Park) pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to 20.0 million of our common stock from time to
time over a 36-month period (unless extended to a 48-month period pursuant to the terms thereof). On August 8, 2024, we completed a registered
direct offering and concurrent private placement, raising a total of approximately 2.5 million, net of placement agent and other offering
expenses. We may also issue in the future equity securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our
common stock. Given our need for cash and that equity issuances are the most common type of fundraising for similarly situated companies,
the risk of dilution is particularly significant for our stockholders. Depending upon market liquidity at the time, additional sales
of shares registered at any given time could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Debt financing, if available, would
result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to
take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through
collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies,
future revenue streams or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.

Risks Related to the Discovery and Development
of Our Product Candidates 

We
are dependent on the success of one or more of our current product candidates, and we cannot be certain that any of them will receive
regulatory approval or be commercialized. 

We
have spent significant time, money and effort on the development of our lead product candidate, Decoy20. As a result, our business is
largely dependent on the commencement of and success of clinical trials evaluating Decoy20 and our ability to complete the development
of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize Decoy20 in a timely manner. The process to develop, obtain regulatory
approval and commercialize Decoy20 is long, complex, costly and uncertain as to the outcome. 

To
date, no clinical trials designed to provide substantial evidence of safety, purity, potency or efficacy have been completed with any
of our product candidates. All of our product candidates will require additional development, including clinical trials as well as further
preclinical studies to evaluate their toxicology and optimize their formulation and regulatory approvals before they can be commercialized.
Positive results obtained during early development do not necessarily mean later development will succeed or that regulatory approvals
will be obtained. Our development efforts may not lead to commercial products, either because our product candidates fail to be safe
and effective, or in the case of our product candidates regulated as biologics, safe, pure and potent, or because we have inadequate
financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical development and approval processes. If any of our
product candidates fail to demonstrate safety, purity, potency or efficacy at any time or during any phase of development, we would experience
potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of the product candidate. 

We
do not anticipate that any of our current product candidates will be eligible to receive regulatory approval from the FDA, the EMA or
comparable foreign authorities and begin commercialization for a number of years, if ever. Even if we ultimately receive regulatory approval
for any of these product candidates, we or our potential future partners, if any, may be unable to commercialize them successfully for
a variety of reasons. These include, for example, the availability of alternative treatments, lack of cost-effectiveness, the cost of
manufacturing the product on a commercial scale and competition with other products. The success of our product candidates may also be
limited by the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects. If we fail to commercialize one or more of our current product candidates,
we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to attain or maintain profitability, and our financial condition may decline. 

Clinical
and preclinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. Any difficulties or delays in the commencement
or completion, or the termination or suspension, of our current or planned clinical trials could result in increased costs to us, delay
or limit our ability to generate revenue or adversely affect our commercial prospects. 

Before
obtaining approval from regulatory authorities for the commercialization of any of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive
clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency, or efficacy of the product candidate in humans. Preclinical and clinical
drug development is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any
time during the preclinical study or clinical trial process. Despite promising preclinical or clinical results, any product candidate
can unexpectedly fail at any stage of preclinical or clinical development. The historical failure rate for product candidates in our
industry is high. 

The
results from preclinical studies or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results of later clinical trials
of the product candidate, and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. Product candidates
in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy characteristics despite having progressed through
preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. It is not uncommon to observe results in clinical trials that are unexpected based on
preclinical studies and early clinical trials, and many product candidates fail in clinical trials despite very promising early results.
Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical development even after achieving promising results in earlier
studies. 

12 

Before
we can initiate clinical trials for any product candidates, we must submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA, the EMA or
comparable foreign regulatory authorities along with other information, including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing
and controls and our proposed clinical trial protocol, as part of an IND or similar regulatory submission. The FDA, the EMA or comparable
foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional preclinical studies for any product candidate before it allows us
to initiate clinical trials under any IND or similar regulatory submission, which may lead to delays and increase the costs of our preclinical
development programs. Moreover, even if we commence clinical trials, issues may arise that could cause regulatory authorities to suspend
or terminate such clinical trials. Any such delays in the commencement or completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our
product candidates could significantly affect our product development timelines and product development costs and harm our financial
position. 

We
do not know whether our planned clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement, data readouts
and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to: 

inability
 to generate sufficient preclinical, toxicology, or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation or continuation of clinical
 trials; 

failure
 in obtaining allowance or approval from regulatory authorities to commence a trial or reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities
 on trial design; 

the
 FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials; 

any
 failure or delay in reaching an agreement with CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation
 and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites; 

delays
 in identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators; 

failure
 in obtaining approval from one or more institutional review boards (IRBs) or ethics committees at clinical trial sites; 

IRBs
 refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects,
 or withdrawing their approval of the trial; 

changes
 or amendments to the clinical trial protocol; 

clinical
 sites deviating from the trial protocol or dropping out of a trial; 

failure
 by our CROs to perform in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements or applicable regulatory rules and guidelines
 in other countries; 

failure
 in manufacturing sufficient quantities of our product candidates, or obtaining sufficient quantities of combination therapies, for
 use in clinical trials; 

subjects
 failing to enroll or remain in our trials at the rate we expect, or failing to return for post-treatment follow-up, including subjects
 failing to remain in our trials; 

patients
 choosing an alternative product for the indications for which we are developing our product candidates, or participating in competing
 clinical trials; 

lack
 of adequate funding to continue a clinical trial, or costs being greater than we anticipate; 

13 

subjects
 experiencing severe or serious unexpected drug-related adverse effects; 

occurrence
 of serious adverse events in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other companies that could be considered similar to
 our product candidates; 

selection
 of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or extended analysis of the resulting data; 

transfer
 of manufacturing processes to larger-scale facilities operated by a contract manufacturing organization (CMO), delays or failure
 by our CMOs or us to make any necessary changes to such manufacturing process, or failure of our CMOs to produce clinical trial materials
 in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), regulations or other applicable requirements; and 

third
 parties being unwilling or unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner. 

Clinical
trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities legal requirements, regulations
and guidelines, and remain subject to oversight by these governmental agencies and ethics committees or IRBs at the medical institutions
where such clinical trials are conducted. We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the
IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by a Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial or by the FDA, the
EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors,
including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or applicable clinical trial protocols, adverse
findings from inspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, unforeseen safety
issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations
or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements
and policies may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to comply with these changes. Amendments may require us to
resubmit our clinical trial protocols to regulators or to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion
of a clinical trial. 

Moreover,
principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation
in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA, the
EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may conclude that a financial
relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study.
The FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable
clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection,
of our marketing applications by the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately
lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates. 

In
addition, the FDA s, the EMA s and other regulatory authorities policies with respect to clinical trials may change
and additional government regulations may be enacted. For instance, the regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU recently
evolved. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR) which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became
applicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (CTA) to be submitted
in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, the CTR introduces a centralized
process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single
submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state.
The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate
assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member
state s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development
may proceed. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by
the CTR varies. Clinical trials for which an application was submitted (i) prior to January 31, 2022 under the Clinical Trials Directive,
or (ii) between January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023 and for which the sponsor has opted for the application of the Clinical Trials
Directive remain governed by said Directive until January 31, 2025. After this date, all clinical trials (including those which are ongoing)
will become subject to the provisions of the CTR. Compliance with the CTR requirements by us and our third-party service providers, such
as CROs, may impact our developments plans. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of
new requirements or policies governing clinical trials, our development plans may be impacted. 

In
addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, the termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion
of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any resulting delays to our
clinical trials could shorten any period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates. In such
cases, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could
be significantly reduced. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects. 

14 

We
expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses and other operating expenses, which may make it difficult for
us to attain profitability. 

We
expect to expend substantial funds in research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates,
and to manufacture and market any product candidates in the event they are approved for commercial sale. We also may need additional
funding to develop or acquire complementary companies, technologies and assets, as well as for working capital requirements and other
operating and general corporate purposes. Moreover, our planned increases in staffing will dramatically increase our costs in the near
and long-term. 

Because
the successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to precisely estimate the actual funds we will require
to develop and potentially commercialize them. In addition, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue, even if we are able to
commercialize any of our product candidates, to become profitable. 

We
may expend our limited resources to pursue a limited number of research programs, product candidates and specific indications and fail
to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. 

Due
to our limited financial and managerial resources, we must focus on a limited number of research programs and product candidates and
on specific indications. As such, we are currently focused on the development of Decoy20. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit
of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications for anti-cancer and anti-viral immunotherapy that later prove
to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products
or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific
indications may not yield any commercially viable products. 

Our
product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization, cause
us to suspend or discontinue clinical trials, abandon a product candidate, limit the commercial profile of an approved product, or result
in other significant adverse implications on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

As
is the case with pharmaceuticals generally, it is likely that there may be side effects and adverse events associated with our product
candidates use. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or
unexpected characteristics. For example, because the mechanism of action of our product candidates depends on stimulation of the immune
system, there is the potential for over-stimulation or undesirable immune reactions. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates,
whether used alone or in combination with other therapies, could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical
trials or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, or, if such product
candidates are approved, result in a more restrictive label and other post-approval requirements. Any treatment-related side effects
could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or could result in potential product
liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. 

If
our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have unexpected characteristics in preclinical studies or clinical
trial, when used alone or in combination with other approved products or product candidates, we may need to interrupt, delay or abandon
their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics
are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. 

Patients
in our ongoing and planned clinical trials may, in the future, suffer significant adverse events or other side effects not observed in
our preclinical studies or previous clinical trials. Patients treated with our product candidates may also be undergoing surgical, radiation
or chemotherapy treatments, which can cause side effects or adverse events that are unrelated to our product candidate, but may still
impact the success of our clinical trials. The inclusion of critically ill patients in our clinical trials may result in deaths or other
adverse medical events due to other therapies or medications that such patients may be using or due to the gravity of such patients 
illnesses. If such significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials, we
may have difficulty recruiting patients to the clinical trials, or we may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts
of that product candidate altogether. We, the FDA, other comparable regulatory authorities or an IRB may suspend clinical trials of a
product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable
health risks or adverse side effects. Even if the side effects do not preclude the product candidate from obtaining or maintaining regulatory
approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance due to tolerability concerns as compared to other available therapies.
Any of these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects. 

Additionally,
if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such
product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result. For example, the FDA could require us to adopt a Risk
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), to ensure that the benefits of treatment with such product candidate outweigh the risks for
each potential patient, which may include, among other things, a communication plan to health care practitioners, patient education,
extensive patient monitoring or distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled, restrictive and more costly than what
is typical for the industry. We or our collaborators may also be required to adopt a REMS or engage in similar actions, such as patient
education, certification of health care professionals or specific monitoring, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects
caused by any product that we develop alone or with collaborators. Other potentially significant negative consequences associated with
adverse events include: 

we
 may be required to suspend marketing of a product, or we may decide to remove such product from the marketplace; 

regulatory
 authorities may withdraw or change their approvals of a product; 

regulatory
 authorities may require additional warnings on the label or limit access of a product to selective specialized centers with additional
 safety reporting and with requirements that patients be geographically close to these centers for all or part of their treatment; 

we
 may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of a product for patients, or to conduct post-marketing studies; 

we
 may be required to change the way a product is administered; 

we
 could be subject to fines, injunctions, or the imposition of criminal or civil penalties, or be sued and held liable for harm caused
 to subjects or patients; and 

a
 product may become less competitive, and our reputation may suffer. 

15 

Any
of these events could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of our product candidates and prevent us from achieving
or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. 

We
may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials. If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials,
our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. 

Patient
enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, and the timing of our clinical trials depends, in part, on the speed
at which we can recruit patients to participate in our trials, as well as completion of required follow-up periods. We may not be able
to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible
patients to participate in these trials to such trial s conclusion as required by the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities.
The conditions for which we currently plan to evaluate our product candidates are diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw
for clinical trials. The eligibility criteria of our clinical trials, once established, may further limit the pool of available trial
participants. 

Patient
enrollment for any of our clinical trials may be affected by other factors, including: 

size
 and nature of the targeted patient population; 

severity
 of the disease or condition under investigation; 

availability
 and efficacy of approved therapies for the disease or condition under investigation; 

patient
 eligibility criteria for the trial in question as defined in the protocol; 

perceived
 risks and benefits of the product candidate under study; 

clinicians 
 and patients perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available
 therapies, including any products that may be approved for, or any product candidates under investigation for, the indications we
 are investigating; 

efforts
 to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; 

patient
 referral practices of physicians; 

the
 ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; 

proximity
 and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; 

continued
 enrollment of prospective patients by clinical trial sites; and 

the
 risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of such trials before completion. 

Additionally,
other pharmaceutical companies targeting these same diseases are recruiting clinical trial patients from these patient populations, which
may make it more difficult to fully enroll our clinical trials. We also rely on, and will continue to rely on, CROs and clinical trial
sites to ensure proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and preclinical studies. Though we have entered into agreements governing
their services, we will have limited influence over their actual performance. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients
for our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment
delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to obtain
regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates. Furthermore, even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients
for our clinical trials, we may have difficulty maintaining enrollment of such patients in our clinical trials. 

16 

Interim,
 topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials and preclinical studies that we announce or publish from time to
time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material
changes in the final data. 

From
time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, topline, or preliminary data from our clinical trials and preclinical studies, which
is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change
following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations
and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate
all data. As a result, the interim, topline, or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies
or trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated.
Topline and preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially
different from the topline or preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline and preliminary data should be viewed with
caution until the final data is available. 

Interim
data from clinical trials that we may complete are further subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially
change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data becomes available. Adverse differences between interim, topline, or preliminary
data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of such data by us or by our competitors could
result in volatility in the price of our common stock. 

Further,
others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses
or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability
or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose
to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others
may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information
we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or
otherwise regarding a particular product candidate or our business. If the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report differ
from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval
for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial
condition. 

Our
efforts to discover product candidates beyond our current product candidates may not succeed, and any product candidates we recommend
for clinical development may not actually begin clinical trials. 

We
intend to expand our existing pipeline of core assets. However, the process of researching and developing new product candidates is expensive,
time-consuming and unpredictable. Data from our current preclinical programs may not support the clinical development of our product
candidates, and we may not identify any additional products suitable for recommendation for clinical development. Moreover, any product
candidate we recommend for clinical development may not demonstrate, through preclinical studies, indications of safety and potential
efficacy that would support advancement into clinical trials. Such findings would potentially impede our ability to maintain or expand
our clinical development pipeline. Our ability to develop new product candidates and advance them into clinical development also depends
upon our ability to fund our research and development operations, and we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available
on acceptable terms, or at all. 

The
regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the EMA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable,
and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed. 

The
clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution
of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and by comparable foreign regulatory authorities
in foreign markets, such as the EMA in Europe. In the U.S., we are not permitted to market our product candidates in the U.S. until we
receive regulatory approval of a Biologics License Application (BLA) or New Drug Application (NDA) from the FDA. The process of obtaining
such regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and can vary substantially
based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, as well as the target indications and patient population.
Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA, EMA and comparable regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the
approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and
expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval of a product candidate is never guaranteed. Of the
large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory approval processes
and are commercialized. 

17 

Prior
to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the U.S. or abroad, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from
adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, that
such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses, and in the case of biological products, that such product candidates
are safe, pure and potent. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe
available nonclinical or clinical data support the safety purity, potency or efficacy of our product candidates, such data may not be
sufficient to obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory
authorities, as the case may be, may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates
either prior to or post-approval, or may object to elements of our clinical development program. 

The
FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including: 

such
 authorities may disagree with the design or execution of our clinical trials; 

negative
 or ambiguous results from our clinical trials or results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA,
 EMA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies for approval; 

serious
 and unexpected drug-related side effects may be experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs
 similar to our product candidates; 

the
 population studied in the clinical trial may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population
 for which we seek approval; 

such
 authorities may not accept clinical data from trials that are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard
 of care is potentially different from that of their own country; 

we
 may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; 

such
 authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

such
 authorities may not agree that the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are acceptable or sufficient to
 support the submission of a BLA, NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. or elsewhere, and such authorities
 may impose requirements for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

such
 authorities may disagree with us regarding the formulation, labeling and/or the product specifications of our product candidates; 

approval
 may be granted only for indications that are significantly more limited than those sought by us, and/or may include significant restrictions
 on distribution and use; 

such
 authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of the third-party manufacturers with which we contract
 for clinical and commercial supplies; or 

such
 authorities may not accept a submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission. 

18 

With
respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the foregoing risks, may involve additional
product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. Even if we eventually complete clinical trials
and receive approval of a BLA, NDA or comparable foreign marketing application for our product candidates, the FDA or comparable foreign
regulatory authority may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials and/or the implementation
of a REMS, which may be required because the FDA believes it is necessary to ensure safe use of the product after approval. Any delay
in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of that product candidate
and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects. 

Even
if we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates in the United States, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize such
candidates in any other jurisdiction, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. 

In
order to market any products in any particular jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements
on a country-by-country basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval by the FDA in the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory
authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our
ability to obtain approval elsewhere. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities
in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. 

Approval
processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation, as well as additional administrative review
periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and increased costs for us and require additional preclinical
studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country
and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale
in any jurisdiction, including in international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international
markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or
if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market
potential of any product we develop will be unrealized. 

Disruptions
at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain
or deploy key leadership and other personnel, prevent new or modified products from being developed, reviewed, approved or commercialized
in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business. 

The
ability of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including
government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA s or foreign regulatory authorities 
ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA s
or foreign regulatory authorities ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the FDA and foreign regulatory
authorities have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research
and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 

Disruptions
at the FDA and other agencies, such as the EMA following its relocation to Amsterdam and resulting staff changes, may also slow the time
necessary for new drugs, and biologics or modifications to approved drugs and biologics to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government
agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several
times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities. 

19 

Even
if we receive regulatory approval for any product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory
review, which may result in significant additional expenses. 

Any
regulatory approvals that we may receive for our product candidates will require the submission of reports to regulatory authorities
and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate, may contain significant limitations related to use restrictions
for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, and may include burdensome post-approval study or risk management
requirements. For example, the FDA may require a REMS in order to approve our product candidates, which could entail requirements for
a medication guide, physician training and communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution
methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve our
product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion,
import, export and recordkeeping for our product candidates will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements
include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as on-going compliance with cGMPs
and GCP for any clinical trials that we may conduct. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to
continual review and periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations
and standards. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated
severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions
on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension
of manufacturing. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory requirements may subject our company
to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including: 

restrictions
 on the marketing or manufacturing of our products, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; 

restrictions
 on product distribution or use, or requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials; 

fines,
 restitutions, disgorgement of profits or revenues, warning letters, untitled letters or holds on clinical trials; 

refusal
 by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us or suspension or revocation of
 approvals; 

product
 seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our products; and 

injunctions
 or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The
occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue
and could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. 

The
FDA s and other regulatory authorities policies may change and additional government regulations may be promulgated that
could prevent, limit or delay marketing authorization of any product candidates we develop. We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature
or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not
able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 

The
FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. 

The
FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drugs. These regulations include standards and
restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving
the internet and off-label promotion. Any regulatory approval that the FDA grants is limited to those specific diseases and indications
for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by FDA. While physicians in the United States may choose, and are generally permitted,
to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical
trials and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote any products will be narrowly limited to those indications
that are specifically approved by the FDA. 

20 

If
we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The U.S. federal government has levied
large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined several companies from
engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under
which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of any product candidates,
if approved, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

Risks
Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 

The
commercial success of our product candidates depends upon their market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the
medical community. 

Even
if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, our products, if any, may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients,
healthcare payors and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates will depend on
a number of factors, including: 

the
 effectiveness of our approved product candidates as compared to currently available products; 

patient
 willingness to adopt our approved product candidates in place of current therapies; 

our
 ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy; 

relative
 convenience and ease of administration; 

the
 prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects; 

restrictions
 on use in combination with other products; 

availability
 of alternative treatments; 

pricing
 and cost-effectiveness assuming either competitive or potential premium pricing requirements, based on the profile of our product
 candidates and target markets; 

effectiveness
 of our or our partners sales and marketing strategy; 

our
 ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and 

potential
 product liability claims. 

In
addition, the potential market opportunity for our product candidates is difficult to precisely estimate. Our estimates of the potential
market opportunity for our product candidates include several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications,
third-party research reports and other surveys. Independent sources have not verified all of our assumptions. If any of these assumptions
prove to be inaccurate, then the actual market for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of our potential market
opportunity. If the actual market for our product candidates is smaller than we expect, our product revenues may be limited, it may be
harder than expected to raise funds, and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability. If we fail to achieve
market acceptance of our product candidates in the U.S. and abroad, our revenue will be limited and it will be more difficult to achieve
profitability. 

21 

We
rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and perform other tasks. If these third parties do not successfully
carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory
approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially
harmed. 

We
rely upon third-party CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to monitor and manage data for our
ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. These CROs, investigators and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct and
timing of these trials and subsequent collection and analysis of data. Though we expect to carefully manage our relationships with such
CROs, investigators and other third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future,
or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. Further,
while we have and will have agreements governing the activities of our third-party contractors, we have limited influence over their
actual performance. Nevertheless, we maintain responsibility for ensuring that each of our clinical trials and preclinical studies is
conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on these third parties
does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with requirements for
cGMP, or similar foreign requirements, GCP, and good laboratory practice (GLP), which are a collection of laws and regulations enforced
by the FDA, the EMA and comparable foreign authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities
enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of preclinical study and clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators, preclinical
study and clinical trial sites, and other contractors. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fail to comply with applicable regulations,
the data generated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign
authorities may require us to perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.
We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical
trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced consistent with cGMP regulations,
or similar foreign requirements. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require it to repeat clinical trials, which would delay
the development and regulatory approval processes. 

We
may not be able to enter into arrangements with CROs on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our CROs will not be our
employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we will not be able to control whether or not
they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their
contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they
obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials
may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product
candidates. CROs may also generate higher costs than anticipated. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations
and the commercial prospects for our product candidates could be materially and adversely affected, our costs could increase, and our
ability to generate revenue could be delayed. 

In
addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may be asked to serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time
to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation
result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation
of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical
trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection by the FDA of any BLA or NDA we submit. Any such delay
or rejection could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. 

In
addition, our CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach and under other specified
circumstances. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative
third parties on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Switching or adding additional CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators
or contract laboratories involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition
period when a new CRO commences work replacing a previous CRO. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to
meet our desired clinical development timelines. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in
the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations. 

22 

We
currently rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates during clinical development, and expect to continue to
rely on third parties for the foreseeable future. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient
quantities of our product candidates, or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development
or potential commercialization efforts. 

We
do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and have no current plans to develop our own clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing
capabilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates, and related raw
materials for clinical development, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval.
The facilities used by our third-party manufacturers must be approved for the manufacture of our product candidates by the FDA, EMA,
or any comparable foreign regulatory authority, pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an NDA or BLA to the FDA,
or submit a comparable marketing application to a foreign regulatory authority. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are
completely dependent on, third-party manufacturers for compliance with cGMP requirements for manufacture of our product candidates. If
these third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory
requirements of the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval
for the use of their manufacturing facilities. 

In
addition, we have no control over the ability of third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and
qualified personnel. If the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture
our product candidates, or if such authorities withdraw any such approval in the future, we may be required to find alternative manufacturing
facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates,
if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions
being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures
or recalls, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our financial position. 

Our
or a third party s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements on commercially reasonable terms and in compliance with
cGMP or other regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including: 

an
 inability to initiate or complete clinical trials of our product candidates in a timely manner; 

delay
 in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for our product candidates; 

subjecting
 third-party manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory authorities; 

requirements
 to cease development or to recall batches of our product candidates; and 

in
 the event of approval to market and commercialize any product candidate, an inability to meet commercial demands. 

In
addition, we do not have any long-term commitments or supply agreements with any third-party manufacturers. We may be unable to establish
any long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms, which increases the risk of failing to
timely obtain sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost. Even if we are able to establish
agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including: 

failure
 of third-party manufacturers to comply with regulatory requirements and maintain quality assurance; 

breach
 of the manufacturing agreement by the third party; 

failure
 to manufacture our product candidates according to our specifications; 

failure
 to manufacture our product according to our schedule or at all; 

misappropriation
 of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and 

termination
 or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. 

23 

Any
performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval, and any
related remedial measures may be costly or time consuming to implement. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant
supply or a second source for all required raw materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates. If our existing or future
third-party manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers and we may be unable to replace
them on a timely basis or at all, which would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. 

Any
clinical supply or collaboration arrangement that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely
affect our ability to develop and commercialize our current and potential future product candidates. 

We
may seek clinical supply or collaboration arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies for the development or commercialization of our
current and potential future product candidates. For example, in October 2024, we entered into a clinical supply agreement with
BeiGene to advance the clinical trial evaluation of Decoy20 in combination with BeiGene s anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab (the
 BeiGene Product for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors (the Combination Study ). Under
our agreement with BeiGene, we will rely on BeiGene for the supply of the Beigene Product. If BeiGene cannot perform as agreed, we may
be unable to initiate or complete the Combination Study in a timely manner or at all. 

To the extent that we decide to enter into collaboration agreements, we will
face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time
consuming to negotiate, execute and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or
other alternative arrangements should we choose to enter into such arrangements, and the terms of the arrangements may not be
favorable to us. If and when we collaborate with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can
expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third party. 

The
success of our clinical supply and collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our
collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to
these collaborations. 

Disagreements
between parties to a clinical supply or collaboration arrangement can lead to delays in developing or commercializing the applicable
product candidate and can be difficult to resolve in a mutually beneficial manner. In some cases, collaborations with
biopharmaceutical companies and other third parties are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination or
expiration would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If
we are unable to develop our own commercial organization or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates,
we may be unable to generate significant revenues. 

We
do not have a sales and marketing organization, and we have no experience as a company in the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical
products. If any of our product candidates are ever approved for commercialization, we may be required to develop our sales, marketing
and distribution capabilities, or make arrangements with a third party to perform sales and marketing services. Developing a sales force
for any product resulting from any of our product candidates is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. We may
be unable to establish and manage an effective sales force in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all, and any sales force we do
establish may not be capable of generating sufficient demand for our product candidates. To the extent that we enter into arrangements
with collaborators or other third parties to perform sales and marketing services, our product revenues are likely to be lower than if
we marketed and sold our product candidates independently. If we are unable to establish adequate sales and marketing capabilities, independently
or with others, we may not be able to generate significant revenues and may not become profitable. 

24 

Risks
Related to Commercialization 

The
successful commercialization of Decoy20 or any future product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which governmental
authorities and health insurers establish coverage, adequate reimbursement levels and favorable pricing policies. Failure to obtain or
maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability
to generate revenue. 

The
availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private
health insurers and other third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford prescription medications such as Decoy20
and any future product candidates, if approved. Our ability to achieve coverage and acceptable levels of reimbursement for our products
by third-party payors will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize those products. Accordingly, we will need to successfully
implement a coverage and reimbursement strategy for any approved product candidate. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product by
a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably
high. 

If
we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs, in certain circumstances, our products would
be subject to ceiling prices set by such programs, which could reduce the revenue we may generate from any such products. Participation
in such programs would also expose us to the risk of significant civil monetary penalties, sanctions and fines should we be found to
be in violation of any applicable obligations thereunder. 

For
products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult
because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment
or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. We cannot be sure that coverage
and reimbursement in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will be available, or at an acceptable level, for any product
that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future. 

Third-party
payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for biopharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse
to provide coverage and reimbursement for particular drugs when an equivalent generic drug or a less expensive therapy is available.
It is possible that a third-party payor may consider our products as substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the less
expensive product. Even if we are successful in demonstrating improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our products,
pricing of existing drugs may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our products. These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement
status of a given product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize
an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels,
we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on products
that we may develop. 

There
is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States,
third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in
determining the extent to which new drugs will be covered. Some third-party payors may require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative
devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. It is difficult to predict at this
time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for Decoy20 and any future product candidates. 

Obtaining
and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming, costly and uncertain. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used
as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs. However,
no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage
and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often
a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each
payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently and, in some cases, at short notice, and we believe that
changes in these rules and regulations are likely. 

Outside
the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations,
and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries has and will continue to put pressure
on the pricing and usage of our products candidates, if approved in these jurisdictions. In many countries, the prices of medical products
are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own
prices for medical products but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation
could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our products. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, if any, the
reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable
revenue and profits. 

25 

Moreover,
increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause
such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover
or provide adequate payment for our products. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our products
due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes.
The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and prescription drugs, surgical procedures and other treatments in particular,
has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. 

Recently
enacted legislation, future legislation and healthcare reform measures may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing
approval for and commercialize Decoy20 and any future product candidates and may affect the prices we may set. 

In
the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and
regulatory changes to the healthcare system, including cost-containment measures that may reduce or limit coverage and reimbursement
for newly approved drugs and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In
particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare
costs and improve the quality of healthcare.

way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity
that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; extended manufacturers Medicaid rebate
liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; expanded eligibility criteria
for Medicaid programs; expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B drug pricing program; increased the statutory minimum
rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute
to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
establishes a Center for Medicare Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare
and Medicaid spending. 

Since
its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and on June 17, 2021,
the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling
on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court s decision, President Biden had issued an executive order to initiate
a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through
the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies
and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that
include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid
or the ACA. It is unclear how the healthcare reform measures will impact our business. 

In
addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue
Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory cap on the Medicaid drug rebate, beginning January 1, 2024 at 100 
of a drug s AMP. Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices
in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed
and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship
between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products.
Most recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, included a number of significant drug pricing reforms, which include the
establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (beginning in 2026)
that requires manufacturers to charge a negotiated maximum fair price for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for
noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases
that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and a redesign of the Part D benefit, as part of which manufacturers are required to provide
discounts on Part D drugs (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the HHS Secretary to implement many of these provisions through guidance,
as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. On August 29, 2023, HHS announced the list of the first ten drugs that will be subject
to price negotiations, although the drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. For that and other reasons,
it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated. Additional drug pricing proposals could appear in future legislation. Further,
it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

26 

At
the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and
biological product pricing, including price or reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing
cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding
procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare
programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for Decoy20 and any future product candidates, if approved, or put pressure on our product
pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

We
expect that these new laws and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions
in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure
on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may
result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms
may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize Decoy20 and any future product candidates,
if approved. 

Product
liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any product candidates
that we may develop. 

We
will face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and
will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any product candidates that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves
against claims that our product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome,
liability claims may result in: 

decreased
 demand for any product candidates that we may develop; 

injury
 to our reputation and significant negative media attention; 

regulatory
 investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications; 

withdrawal
 of clinical trial participants; 

significant
 costs to defend the related litigation; 

substantial
 monetary awards to trial participants or patients; 

loss
 of potential revenue; 

the
 diversion of management s attention away from managing our business; and 

the
 inability to commercialize any product candidates that we may develop. 

27 

Although
we maintain product liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur and is subject to
deductibles and coverage limitations. We anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage when and if we successfully
commercialize any product candidate. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage
at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. If we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable
cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially
and adversely affect our business and financial position. These liabilities could prevent or interfere with our commercialization efforts. 

We
are subject to a multitude of manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit the supply of our product
candidates. 

The
process of manufacturing our product candidates is complex, highly regulated, and subject to several risks. For example, the process
of manufacturing our product candidates is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper
installation or operation of equipment, or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes for any
of our product candidates could result in reduced production yields, product defects, and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral,
or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are
made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination.
In addition, the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures,
labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors. 

In
addition, any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our product candidates may result in shipment delays, inventory
shortages, lot failures, withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our product candidates. We also may need to
take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for product candidates that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly
remediation efforts, or seek costlier manufacturing alternatives. 

Risks
Related to Competition, Retaining Key Employees and Managing Growth 

If
our competitors have product candidates that are approved faster, marketed more effectively, are better tolerated, have a more favorable
safety profile or are demonstrated to be more effective than our product candidates, our commercial opportunity may be adversely affected. 

The
industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary
products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide it with competitive advantages,
we face potential competition from many different sources, including commercial biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government
agencies and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete
with existing immunotherapies and new immunotherapies that may become available in the future. 

Many
of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical
studies, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also
prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our competitors
may succeed in developing technologies and therapies that are more effective, better tolerated or less costly than any which we are developing,
or that would render our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product
candidates, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products earlier than we do. We will also face competition
from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites
and patient registration for clinical trials, and in acquiring and in-licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs
or advantageous to our business. 

The
key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety,
tolerability, frequency and route of administration, convenience and price, the level of branded and generic competition, market acceptance
by physicians and patients, and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 

28 

Any
product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated. 

The
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition
and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or
interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be
submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval
of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed.
During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves
a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical
trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. 

We
believe that any of our future product candidates approved as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period
of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to Congressional action or otherwise, or that the
FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for
generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, could be substituted for any
one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products will depend on
a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. 

Our
future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. 

We
are highly dependent on our current senior management. If we fail to retain current members of our senior management and scientific personnel,
or to attract and keep additional key personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates. We
are highly dependent on our chief executive officer, Jeffrey A. Meckler, and our chief scientific officer, Michael J. Newman, Ph.D. Our
success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel. However,
competition for qualified personnel is intense. We may not be successful in attracting qualified personnel to fulfill our current or
future needs on a full-time employment basis, or at all. In the event we are unable to fill critical open employment positions, we may
need to delay our operational activities and goals, including the development of the company s product candidates, and may have
difficulty in meeting our obligations as a public company. We do not currently maintain key person insurance on any of
our employees. 

In
addition, competitors and others are likely in the future to attempt to recruit our employees. The loss of the services of any of our
key personnel, the inability to attract or retain highly qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring such personnel, particularly
senior management and other technical personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. In addition, the replacement of key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay
or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. From time to time, our management seeks the advice and guidance of certain scientific
advisors and consultants regarding clinical and regulatory development programs and other customary matters. These scientific advisors
and consultants are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may
limit their availability to us. In addition, our scientific advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies
in developing products or technologies that may compete with us. 

We
will need to increase the size of our organization and may not successfully manage our growth. 

We
are an early clinical-stage biotechnology company with a small number of employees, and our management systems currently in place are
not likely to be adequate to support our future growth plans. Our ability to grow and to manage our growth effectively will require us
to hire, train, retain, manage and motivate additional employees and to implement and improve our operational, financial and management
systems. These demands also may require the hiring of additional senior management personnel or the development of additional expertise
by our senior management personnel. Hiring a significant number of additional employees, particularly those at the management level,
would increase our expenses significantly. Moreover, if we fail to expand and enhance our operational, financial and management systems
in conjunction with our potential future growth, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

29 

Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property 

We
may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary or licensed technology in the marketplace. 

We
depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and products, or those that we may license. We intend to rely on trade secret,
patent, copyright and trademark laws, confidentiality, license, and other agreements with employees and third parties to protect our
intellectual property. Our success depends in large part on our ability and any licensor s or licensee s ability to obtain
and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our proprietary or licensed technology and products. We
cannot be certain that patent enforcement activities by future licensors will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations
or will result in valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property rights. We also cannot be certain that future licensors
will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize their or our enforcement of such patents. Even if we are not a party to these legal
actions, an adverse outcome could prevent us from licensing intellectual property that we may need to operate our business, which would
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
believe we will be able to obtain, through prosecution of patent applications covering our owned technology, adequate patent protection
for our proprietary technology. If we are compelled to spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents and future
patents that we may own, designing around patents held by others or licensing or acquiring, potentially for large fees, patents or other
proprietary rights held by others, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
If we are unable to effectively protect the intellectual property that we own or in-license, other companies may be able to offer the
same or similar products for sale, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The patents of others from whom we may license technology, and any future patents we may own, may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated
or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing the same or similar products or limit the length of
term of patent protection that we may have for our products. 

We
may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses. 

We
may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other intellectual property rights from third parties
that we identify as necessary for our current or future product candidates. We may face competition with regard to acquiring and in-licensing
third-party intellectual property rights, including from a number of more established companies. These established companies may have
a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.
In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license intellectual property rights to us.
We also may be unable to acquire or in- license third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate
return on our investment. 

We
may enter into collaboration agreements with U.S. and foreign academic institutions to accelerate development of our current or future
preclinical product candidates. Typically, these agreements include an option for the company to negotiate a license to the institution s
intellectual property rights resulting from the collaboration. Even with such an option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within
the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to license rights from a collaborating institution,
the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our desired program. 

If
we are unable to successfully obtain required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain our existing intellectual property
rights, we may need to abandon development of the related program and our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected. 

30 

Obtaining
and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements
imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection for licensed patents, pending patent applications and potential future
patent applications and patents could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 

Periodic
maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or patent applications will be due to
be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the
U.S. in several stages over the lifetime of the applicable patent and/or patent application. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental
patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent
application process. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the
applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application,
resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs with respect to our in-licensed patents
or patent applications we may file in the future, our competitors might be able to use our technologies, which would have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The
patent positions of products are often complex and uncertain. The breadth of claims allowed in patents in the U.S. and many jurisdictions
outside of the U.S. may not be consistent. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other
countries may diminish the value of our licensed or owned intellectual property or create uncertainty. In addition, publication of information
related to our current product candidates and potential products may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to these
product candidates and potential products, including without limitation composition-of-matter patents, which are generally believed to
offer the strongest patent protection. 

Patents
that we may own now or may own or license in the future do not necessarily ensure the protection of our licensed or owned intellectual
property for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the following: 

the
 patents may not be broad or strong enough to prevent competition from other products that are identical or similar to our product
 candidates; 

there
 can be no assurance that the term of a patent can be extended under the provisions of patent term extensions afforded by U.S. law
 or similar provisions in foreign countries, where available; 

the
 issued patents and patents that we may own now or may obtain or license in the future may not prevent generic or biosimilar entry
 into the market for our product candidates; 

we,
 or third parties from whom we in-license or may license patents, may be required to disclaim part of the term of one or more patents; 

there
 may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim; 

there
 may be prior art of which we are aware, which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a patent claim, but which,
 nonetheless, ultimately may be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim; 

there
 may be other patents issued to others that will affect our freedom to operate; 

if
 the patents are challenged, a court could determine that they are invalid or unenforceable; 

there
 might be a significant change in the law that governs patentability, validity and infringement of our licensed patents or any future
 patents we may own that adversely affects the scope of our patent rights; 

a
 court could determine that a competitor s technology or product does not infringe our patents or any future patents we may
 own; and 

31 

the
 patents could irretrievably lapse due to failure to pay fees or otherwise comply with regulations or could be subject to compulsory
 licensing. If we encounter delays in our development or clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our potential
 products under patent protection would be reduced. 

Our
competitors may be able to circumvent patents or future patents that we may own by developing similar or alternative technologies or
products in a non-infringing manner. Our competitors may seek to market generic or biosimilar versions of any approved products by submitting
abbreviated new applications or biosimilar biological product applications to the FDA in which our competitors claim that our licensed
patents or any future patents we may own are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, our competitors may seek approval
to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or
assert our patents or any future patents we may own, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types
of proceedings, a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our licensed patents or any future patents we may own invalid or unenforceable.
We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Even
if we own or in-license valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes
sufficient to achieve our business objectives. 

The
issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, ownership, priority, validity or enforceability. In this regard,
third parties may challenge our patents or any future patents we may own in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such
challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable,
in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products,
or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and potential products. In addition, given the amount of time required
for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire
before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. 

Patent
terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time. 

Patents
have a limited lifespan, and the protection patents afford is limited. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid,
the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Even if patents covering
our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for patents covering a product or product candidate, we may be
open to competition from competitive products and services. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights
to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. We may infringe the intellectual property rights of others,
which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and prevent us from commercializing, or increase the costs of commercializing,
our products. 

Our
commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights
of third parties. For example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our current or potential future product candidates
infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe upon, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe upon. 

Moreover,
patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific
or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications
were filed. Because patents can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may
later result in issued patents that our product candidates or potential products infringe. For example, pending applications may exist
that claim or can be amended to claim subject matter that our product candidates or potential products infringe. Competitors may file
continuing patent applications claiming priority to already issued patents in the form of continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part
applications, in order to maintain the pendency of a patent family and attempt to cover our product candidates. 

32 

Third
parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization and may sue us for patent or other intellectual
property infringement. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations
and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate
that our product candidates, potential products or methods either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent
claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the U.S., proving invalidity
requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are
successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel
could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient
resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. If a court holds that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and
cover our products or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our products unless
it acquires or obtains a license under the applicable patents or until the patents expire. 

We
may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any inability
to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our products or lead to prohibition of the
manufacture or sale of products by us. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors
access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing
technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble
damages and attorneys fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from
commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential
information or trade secrets could have a similar material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect
on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. 

Any
claims or lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights brought by or against us will be costly and time consuming
and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
may be required to initiate litigation to enforce or defend our licensed and owned intellectual property. Lawsuits to protect our intellectual
property rights can be very time consuming and costly. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual
property rights in the biopharmaceutical industry generally. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating
expenses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. 

In
any infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial
amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information
could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other
resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are resolved. Further, any claims we
assert against a perceived infringer could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we have infringed their
patents. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because
of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. 

In
addition, our patents and patent applications, and patents and patent applications that we may apply for, own or license in the future,
could face other challenges, such as interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, re-examination proceedings and other forms of
post-grant review. Any of these challenges, if successful, could result in the invalidation of, or in a narrowing of the scope of, any
of our patents and patent applications and patents and patent applications that we may apply for, own or license in the future subject
to challenge. Any of these challenges, regardless of their success, would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve
and would divert our management and scientific personnel s time and attention. 

33 

Changes
in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products. 

As
is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining
and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is costly, time-consuming and
inherently uncertain. For example, the U.S. previously enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation.
Specifically, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law and included a
number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, and many of the provisions became effective in March 2013. However, it may take the
courts years to interpret the provisions of the Leahy-Smith Act, and the implementation of the statute could increase the uncertainties
and costs surrounding the prosecution of our licensed and future patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our licensed and
future patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In
addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available
in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard
to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents,
once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents
could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we might obtain in
the future. 

We
may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 

Filing,
prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates throughout the world could be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our
licensed and owned technologies in jurisdictions where we have not licensed or obtained patent protection to develop their own products
and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain or license patent protection, but where patent
enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any
issued or licensed patents and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent
them from competing. 

Many
companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The
legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual
property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our licensed patents and future patents we may
own, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Further, the laws of some foreign countries
do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the U.S. As a result, we may encounter significant
problems in protecting and defending our licensed and owned intellectual property both in the U.S. and abroad. Proceedings to enforce
our future patent rights, if any, in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from
other aspects of our business. 

We
may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information. 

In
order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners,
employees, consultants, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements
may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized
disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.
Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. 

34 

We
may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents, any future patents we may own, and other intellectual property. 

Although
we are not currently experiencing any claims challenging the inventorship of our patents or our owned intellectual property, we may in
the future be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other
owned intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations
of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and
other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable
intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending
against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. 

Risks
Related to Healthcare Laws and Other Legal Compliance Matters 

We
are subject to various U.S. federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, which could increase compliance costs, and our
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our results of operations and financial condition. 

Our
business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors,
patient organizations and customers expose us to broadly applicable foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws
and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations,
including how we research, market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include: 

the
 federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting,
 offering, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or certain rebates), directly or indirectly, overtly
 or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase, lease, or order, or arranging
 for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole
 or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge
 of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 

the
 federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit, among other things,
 individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval
 that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false
 or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation
 to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting
 from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims
 Act; 

the
 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among
 other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or
 knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection
 with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti- Kickback Statute, a person
 or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 

the
 federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for
 which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to
 report annually to the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS), information related to payments and other transfers
 of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician
 practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology
 assistants and certified nurse-midwives), and teaching hospitals and other healthcare providers, as well as ownership and investment
 interests held by such healthcare professionals and their immediate family members; and 

35 

analogous
 state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing
 arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private
 insurers; some state laws require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry s voluntary compliance
 guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report
 information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures;
 some state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products; and some state
 and local laws that require the registration or pharmaceutical sales representatives. 

Efforts
to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare and privacy laws
and regulations will involve ongoing substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business
practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare
laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that
may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines,
disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity
oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment
or restructuring of our operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant financial
and personnel resources. 

Therefore,
even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. Further,
if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance
with applicable laws or regulations, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions
from government-funded healthcare programs. 

Actual
or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements
could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

The
global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous state, federal and foreign laws, requirements
and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal information. Implementation standards
and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws,
regulations, standards, or perception of their requirements may have on our business. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business,
affect our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate
the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. Each of these laws
is subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues. If we fail to comply with
applicable laws and regulations, we may face government investigations and/or enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties,
private litigation or adverse publicity that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. For example,
we may be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a covered
entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the
Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder or applicable state
laws. 

Violations
of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could subject us to fines, penalties or other costs that
could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. 

We
are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, the handling,
use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Our operations involve
the use of potentially hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous
waste products. We could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements in connection
with our operations or property, including fines, penalties and other sanctions, investigation and cleanup costs and third-party claims.
Although we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of hazardous materials and wastes from our operations, we cannot eliminate
the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous
materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. 

36 

Furthermore,
environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact
of changes to applicable laws and regulations and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs
in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations
may impair our research, development or production efforts. 

Although
we maintain workers compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting
from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain
insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal
of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials. 

Other
Risks Related to Our Business 

Our
business and operations may suffer in the event of information technology system failures, cyberattacks or deficiencies in our cybersecurity. 

We
collect and maintain information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information
technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit
large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information
of customers and our employees and contractors. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity
of such confidential information. 

Our
information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers, strategic partners and other contractors or consultants
are vulnerable to attack and damage or interruption from computer viruses and malware (e.g. ransomware), malicious code, natural disasters,
terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, hacking, cyberattacks, phishing attacks and other social engineering schemes,
employee theft or misuse, human error, fraud, denial or degradation of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported
actors or unauthorized access or use by persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. We
have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result a number of third-party vendors may or could
have access to our confidential information. 

Further,
attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and
are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. We may also face
increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which
may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain
unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may
be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may
remain undetected for an extended period. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches
due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove
or obfuscate forensic evidence. 

We
and certain of our service providers are from time to time subject to cyberattacks and security incidents. While we do not believe that
we have experienced any significant system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions
in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a
loss, corruption or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, personal information or other proprietary or sensitive information
or other similar disruptions. If a security breach or other incident were to result in the unauthorized access to or unauthorized use,
disclosure, release or other processing of personal information, it may be necessary to notify individuals, governmental authorities,
supervisory bodies, the media and other parties pursuant to privacy and security laws. We could also incur liability, including litigation
exposure, penalties and fines, and we could become the subject of regulatory action or investigation. Our competitive position could
be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our products and services could be delayed. We maintain cyber liability
insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result
from an interruption or breach of our systems. While we have implemented a cybersecurity risk management program, there can be no assurance
that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented,
complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information. 

37 

We
may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our
management. 

From
time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing
of products, product candidates or technologies. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different
business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations
and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures
and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including: 

exposure
 to unknown liabilities; 

disruption
 of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates
 or technologies; 

incurrence
 of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for any of these transactions; 

higher-than-expected
 transaction and integration costs; 

write-downs
 of assets or goodwill or impairment charges; 

increased
 amortization expenses; 

difficulty
 and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses or product lines with our operations and personnel; 

impairment
 of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses or product lines due to changes in management and ownership;
 and 

inability
 to retain key employees of any acquired businesses. 

Accordingly,
although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any
transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

The
market price of our common stock is volatile and you may sustain a complete loss of your investment. 

Our
common stock currently trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue
to be, volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are
beyond our control, such as: 

inability
 to obtain the approvals necessary to commence clinical trials; 

38 

results
 of clinical and preclinical studies; 

announcements
 of regulatory approval or the failure to obtain it, or specific label indications or patient populations for its use, or changes
 or delays in the regulatory review process; 

announcements
 of technological innovations, new products or product enhancements by us or others; 

adverse
 actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities; 

changes
 or developments in laws, regulations or decisions applicable to our product candidates or patents; 

any
 adverse changes to our relationship with manufacturers, suppliers or partners; 

announcements
 concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries in general; 

achievement
 of expected product sales and profitability or our failure to meet expectations; 

our
 commencement of or results of, or involvement in, litigation, including, but not limited to, any product liability actions or intellectual
 property infringement actions; 

any
 major changes in our board of directors, management or other key personnel; 

legislation
 in the United States, Europe and other foreign countries relating to the sale or pricing of pharmaceuticals; 

announcements
 by us of significant strategic partnerships, out-licensing, in-licensing, joint ventures, acquisitions or capital commitments; 

expiration
 or terminations of licenses, research contracts or other collaboration agreements; 

public
 concern as to the safety of therapeutics we, any licensees or others develop; 

success
 of research and development projects; 

developments
 concerning intellectual property rights or regulatory approvals; 

variations
 in us and our competitors results of operations; 

changes
 in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts; 

future
 issuances of common stock or other securities; 

general
 market conditions, including the volatility of market prices for shares of biotechnology companies generally, and other factors,
 including factors unrelated to our operating performance; 

political
 and economic instability, war or acts of terrorism (such as Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East)
 or natural disasters, emergence of a pandemic, or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an
 emergency, similar to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic); and 

the
 other factors described in this Risk Factors section. 

39 

These
factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which would
result in substantial losses by our investors. 

Further,
the stock market in general, the Nasdaq Capital Market and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like theirs.
See also General Risk Factors - Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations . Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common
stock regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, a systemic decline in the financial markets and related factors beyond
our control may cause our share price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly. Price volatility of our common stock might be worse if the
trading volume of our common stock is low. In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have often instituted securities
class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant for us because biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock
price volatility in recent years. If we face such securities litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s
resources and attention, which could harm our business. Future sales of our common stock could also reduce the market price of our stock. 

Moreover,
the liquidity of our common stock will be limited, not only in terms of the number of shares of common stock that can be bought and sold
at a given price, but by potential delays in the timing of executing transactions in our common stock and a reduction in security analyst
and media s coverage of us, if any. These factors may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained
and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices for our common stock. In addition, without a large float, our
common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our
common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment
in our common stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our common
stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the
future. 

An
active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. 

An
active public trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell
your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce
the fair value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling
shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports, or publish unfavorable reports about us, our
business or our market, our share price and trading volume could be negatively impacted. 

The
trading market for our common stock could be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish
about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and cannot provide any assurance
that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation
regarding our common stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our share price would likely decline.
If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in
the financial markets, which in turn could negatively impact our share price or trading volume. 

Sales
of a substantial number of our shares in the public market by our existing shareholders could cause our share price to decline. 

Sales
of a substantial number of our shares in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price
of our securities and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are not able to
predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our securities. 

40 

We
are a smaller reporting company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make
our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are considered a smaller reporting company. We are therefore entitled to rely on certain reduced disclosure requirements,
such as an exemption from providing selected financial data and executive compensation information. These exemptions and reduced disclosures
in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations
and financial prospects. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these
exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common
stock and our stock prices may be more volatile. 

Maintaining
and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s
attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members. 

As
a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) rules. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial
compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and place strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial
condition. 

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we disclose whether we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in
place is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. 

We
may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge.
Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and
employees, entail substantial costs, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in
maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate
financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business.
Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. 

In
accordance with Nasdaq rules, we will be required to maintain a majority independent board of directors. The various rules and regulations
applicable to public companies make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain directors and officers liability
insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage. If we are unable
to maintain adequate directors and officers insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors
will be significantly curtailed. 

It
is expected that the rules and regulations applicable to public companies will result in us incurring substantial legal and financial
compliance costs. These costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas
of our business. 

Failure
to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could
have a material adverse effect on our share price. 

As
a public company in the U.S., we incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses in order to comply with requirements of the SEC,
and the Nasdaq Capital Market, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Pursuant to Section
404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, so long as we remain
a smaller reporting company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued
by our independent registered public accounting firm. The process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting
to achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period is both costly and challenging. If we fail to maintain the adequacy
of our internal control over financial reporting as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not
be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC. If we cannot in the future favorably
assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports
may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our share price. 

41 

If
the Domestication Merger (defined below), taken together with the Merger (defined below), fails to qualify as a Section 351(a) Exchange,
former U.S. holders of Intec Pharma (Intec Israel) ordinary shares may recognize taxable gain as a result of the Domestication Merger. 

On
July 27, 2021, Intec Israel, Indaptus Therapeutics, Inc. and Domestication Merger Sub Ltd., an Israeli company and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Indaptus, completed a domestication merger (the Domestication Merger ), pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement
and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated April 27, 2021, whereby Domestication Merger Sub Ltd. merged with and into Intec Israel,
with Intec Israel being the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Indaptus Therapeutics, Inc. On August 3, 2021, Indaptus
Therapeutics, Inc. completed its merger with Decoy, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger
Agreement ), dated March 15, 2021, following which Decoy became the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Indaptus
Therapeutics, Inc. and the business conducted by Decoy became the business conducted by the combined company. Intec Israel intended for
the Merger to qualify as a Section 351(a) Exchange. The position of Intec Israel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and Intec Israel
does not intend to request a ruling from the IRS with respect to the Merger. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will
not challenge the qualification of the Domestication Merger and the Merger as a Section 351(a) Exchange or that a court will not sustain
such a challenge. If the IRS were to be successful in any such contention, or if for any other reason the Domestication Merger was not
treated as part of a Section 351(a) Exchange, the Domestication Merger could be a taxable event to the former U.S. holders of ordinary
shares of Intec Israel. Former holders of Intec Israel s ordinary shares are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with
respect to the tax consequences of the Domestication Merger. 

Notwithstanding
that the Domestication Merger and the Merger together are intended to qualify as a Section 351(a) Exchange, the Domestication Merger
could be a taxable event for certain former U.S. Holders of Intec Israel ordinary shares. 

Subject
to the limitations and qualifications described in The Merger - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Domestication
Merger and the Merger , described in the registration statement on Form S-4, as amended (File No. 333-255389), filed by us
with the SEC, or the Form S-4, including the application of the passive foreign investment company, or PFIC rules, the Domestication
Merger is intended to qualify, taken together with the Merger, as a Section 351(a) Exchange. Nonetheless, certain former U.S. Holders
of Intec Israel s ordinary shares are likely to be taxed under the PFIC rules of the Code because of the likelihood that Intec
Israel is classified as a PFIC. 

General
Risk Factors 

Unfavorable
global economic or geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our
results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. For
example, the U.S. and global markets have been experiencing and are continuing to experience extreme volatility and disruptions in the
capital and credit markets and commodity prices due to rising inflation and interest rates, geopolitical tensions such as the conflict
between Russia and Ukraine and the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza, and other macroeconomic factors. A severe or prolonged economic
downturn, such as the current macroeconomic environment, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, our ability to
raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers of raw
materials used to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Furthermore, our
stock price may decline due in part to the volatility of the stock market and any general economic downturn. 

Changes
in tax law and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

New
income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could affect the
tax treatment of any of our future earnings. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted,
changed, modified or applied adversely to us. Generally, future changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation
and application, potentially with retroactive effect, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. We are unable to predict whether such changes will occur and, if so, the ultimate impact on our business. We urge investors
to consult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of potential changes in tax laws on an investment in our common
stock.
