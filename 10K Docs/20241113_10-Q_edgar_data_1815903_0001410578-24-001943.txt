 (the Settlement Agreement ). As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance of the note is million. The terms of this promissory note are discussed in Note 8 and Note 13. The Company does not currently have sufficient available liquidity to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. In response to these conditions and events, the Company is evaluating various financing strategies to obtain sufficient additional liquidity to meet its operating, debt service and capital requirements for the next twelve months following the date of this Quarterly Report. The potential sources of financing that the Company is evaluating include one or any combination of secured or unsecured debt, convertible debt and equity in both public and private offerings. The Company also plans to finance near-term operations with its cash on hand, including the gross proceeds of million raised in the Private Placement (as defined herein), as well as by exploring additional ways to raise capital and increasing cash flows from operations. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the Private Placement to fund its OTC progress throughout 2024. There is no assurance the Company will manage to raise additional capital or otherwise increase cash flows, if required. The sources of financing described above that could be available to the Company and the timing and probability of obtaining sufficient capital depend, in part, on expanding the use of Stendra and continuing to invest in research and development pursuant to the Company s Non-Prescription / OTC strategies related to Stendra , which the Company believes has the potential to dramatically increase product sales in the future and future capital market conditions. If the Company s current assumptions regarding timing of these events are incorrect or if there are any other changes or differences in the Company s current assumptions that negatively impact the Company s financing strategy, the Company may have to further reduce expenditures or significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of Stendra OTC in order to extend its cash resources. NASDAQ Capital Market Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard On May 15, 2024, the Company received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq (the Staff indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock for the consecutive business day period between April 3, 2024, through May 14, 2024, the Company did not meet the minimum bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Rule ). The letter also indicated that the Company was provided with a compliance period until November 11, 2024, in which to regain compliance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). On November 12, 2024, the Company received notice from the Staff granting the Company s request for a 180-day extension to regain compliance with the Rule, or, until May 12, 2025 (the Compliance Period ).In order to regain compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement, the Company s common stock must maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 for at least ten consecutive business days during the Compliance Period. However, if it appears to Nasdaq that the Company will be unable to cure the deficiency Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company s common stock will be subject to delisting. There can be no assurance that the Nasdaq staff would grant the Company s request for continued listing subsequent to any delisting notification. In the event of such a notification, the Company may appeal the Nasdaq staff s determination to delist its securities.

The Company s plans include, or may include, utilizing cash on hand, as well as exploring additional ways to raise capital in addition to increasing cash flows from operations. In January 2022, the Company executed a promissory note in favor of Vivus in connection with the Vivus Settlement Agreement in the principal amount of 10,201,758, net of a prepayment of 900,000. The terms of this promissory note are discussed in the section titled Vivus Settlement Agreement, Promissory Note and the Security Agreement above. To date, the Company s principal sources of capital used to fund operations have been the revenues from product sales, private sales, registered offerings and private placements of equity securities. The Company does not currently have sufficient available liquidity to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. July 2023 Private Placement On July 13, 2023, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors (the Investors ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell in a private placement to the Investors (i) an aggregate of 15,000 shares of the Company s newly-designated Series A Preferred Stock initially convertible into up to 6,666,668 shares of the Company s common stock at an initial conversion price of 2.25 per share and (ii) warrants to acquire up to an aggregate of 6,666,668 shares of common stock (the Warrants at an initial exercise price of 2.25 per share (collectively, the Private Placement ).

As of September 30, 2024, the Conversion Price and the exercise price of the Warrants was equal to 2.25 per share.

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was 5,854,696 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of 5,089,417 of redemptions of Series A Preferred Stock and 765,279 of principal payments of the promissory note. Net cash provided by financing activities was 13,910,320 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisted of the gross proceeds of the Private Placement, offset by payments of the promissory note. Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements The Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financial guarantees or other off-balance sheet commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. The Company has not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to the Company s shares and classified as stockholder s equity or that are not reflected in the Company s financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Furthermore, the Company does not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. The Company does not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us. Contingencies Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company s management, in consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable, but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by management to evaluate the Company s performance on a comparable basis. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the ongoing operations of the Company s business as Adjusted EBITDA may enhance investors ability to compare historical periods as it adjusts for the impact of financing methods, tax law and strategy changes, and depreciation and amortization and to evaluate the Company s ability to service debt. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measurement that management and the Company s Board of Directors use in their financial and operational decision-making and in the determination of certain compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the Company s industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with GAAP). The Company s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is adjusted to exclude certain items that affect comparability. The adjustments are itemized in the tables below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reason the Company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating adjustments, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below. The presentation of these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or recurring items.

 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude (i) interest expense, net, (ii) depreciation and amortization and (iii) income taxes, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance or that are non-recurring in nature. For example, Adjusted EBITDA: does not reflect the Company s capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company s working capital needs; does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company s debt; and does not reflect payments related to income taxes, if applicable. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023: 

For the Nine Months Ended For the Three Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net Loss (5,045,350) (8,481,338) (2,220,661) (4,549,508) Interest income (347,028) (287,722) (75,817) (168,481) Interest expense, promissory note 393,450 410,317 158,730 131,351 Depreciation and amortization expense 2,175,126 2,480,385 739,449 826,795 EBITDA (2,823,802) (5,878,358) (1,398,299) (3,759,843) Stock based compensation 197,215 204,492 30,840 Change in fair value of derivative liability (3,550,000) 430,000 (202,000) 430,000 Change in fair value of warrant liability (11,739,000) (11,739,000) Loss on issuance of Series A Preferred Stock 11,088,997 11,088,997 Adjusted EBITDA (6,176,587) (5,893,869) (1,600,299) (3,949,006) Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP. Gross Billings Gross billings is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized as a key performance metric by management and the Company s Board of Directors in their financial and operational decision-making as well as for the preparation of the annual budget. The Company believes that gross billings is useful to investors as a supplemental way to provide an alternative measure of the total demand for the products sold by the Company. Gross billings is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the Company s industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net sales as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with GAAP). The Company s presentation of gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Gross billings is adjusted to exclude certain items that affect comparability. The adjustments are itemized in the tables below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reason the Company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating adjustments, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below. The presentation of these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or recurring items. The Company defines gross billings as the amount of its aggregate sales billed to customers at standard prices before the application of certain adjustments that reduce the net amount received from customers, including product returns, certain rebates and coupon redemptions, discounts and fees.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) as of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 5) or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As disclosed in Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weaknesses in internal control related to (1) Petros has an insufficient level of monitoring and oversight controls and does not enforce the implementation of key controls reflected on its internal control process matrices; (2) the sizes of Petros accounting and IT departments make it impracticable to achieve an appropriate segregation of duties; and (3) Petros does not have appropriate IT access related controls. Management plans to expand the scope of its remediation of its internal controls over financial reporting at the consolidated level and has developed a plan to address the remediation of the foregoing deficiencies. Petros remediation efforts are ongoing and it will continue its initiatives to implement and document policies, procedures, and internal controls. The remediation efforts include the implementation of additional controls to ensure all risks have been addressed. Management is further emphasizing compliance with existing internal controls. The Company has continued to utilize an external consultant to assist in the remediation of the deficiencies. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and 

 41

 instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than as noted above.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The information set forth in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated by reference herein. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors associated with our business, financial condition and results of operations previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in our annual report, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements and Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We defaulted on certain covenants included in the Note with Vivus that could result in the acceleration of the related debt or the exercise of other remedies. On October 1, 2024, we failed to make the payment due pursuant to the Note and related Security Agreement in the amount of 0.5 million, constituting an event of Default (as defined in the Note) under the Note and Security Agreement. The outstanding principal amount on the Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was 7.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the Note and Security Agreement are secured by the Company s Stendra API and products and the Company s rights under the License Agreement (the Collateral ). Pursuant to the Note, upon and at all times after the occurrence of any Event of Default, all principal outstanding under the Note will bear increased interest at a rate of 9 per year until the full and final payment of all principal and interest under the Note is paid (regardless of whether any default is waived or cured). Further, Vivus, at its option, may declare any or all amounts owing under the Note (whether principal, interest, or otherwise), to be due and payable, and, subject to the terms of the Security Agreement, foreclose on the Collateral. If the Note is placed in the hands of any attorney for collection, or if it is collected through any legal proceeding at law or in equity or in bankruptcy, receivership, or other court proceedings, the Company will also be required to pay all costs of collection including, but not limited to, court costs and attorneys fees. Any such actions could further impair our ability to operate our business and may result in the loss of key assets necessary for our operations. If we are unable to cure the default, obtain a waiver, or restructure the terms of the Note, we may be forced to seek additional financing on unfavorable terms, restructure our operations, or pursue other alternatives, including bankruptcy. If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. Our common stock is currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market. We must satisfy Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share or risk delisting, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. A delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities. On November 12, 2024, the Company received notice from the Staff granting the Company s request for a 180-day extension to regain compliance with the Rule, or, until May 12, 2025 (the Compliance Period ). 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 On May 15, 2024, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business day period between April 3, 2024, through May 14, 2024, we did not meet the minimum bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Rule ). The letter also indicated that we were provided with a compliance period until November 11, 2024in which to regain compliance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). In order to regain compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement, the Company s common stock must maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 for at least ten consecutive business days during the Compliance Period. However, if it appears to Nasdaq that the Company will be unable to cure the deficiency Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company s common stock will be subject to delisting. There can be no assurance that the Nasdaq staff would grant the Company s request for continued listing subsequent to any delisting notification. In the event of such a notification, the Company may appeal the Nasdaq staff s determination to delist its securities. There is no assurance that we will maintain compliance with such minimum listing requirements. If our common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, trading of our common stock would most likely take place on an over-the-counter market established for unlisted securities, such as the OTCQB or the Pink Market maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc. An investor would likely find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an over-the-counter market, and many investors would likely not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons. In addition, as a delisted security, our common stock would be subject to SEC rules as a penny stock, which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers. The regulations relating to penny stocks, coupled with the typically higher cost per trade to the investor of penny stocks due to factors such as broker commissions generally representing a higher percentage of the price of a penny stock than of a higher-priced stock, would further limit the ability of investors to trade in our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities. For these reasons and others, delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and to raise capital. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. On August 13, 2024, the Company issued 136,986 shares of common stock to Maxim Group LLC Maxim in connection with a services agreement with Maxim. The Company relied upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation D promulgated thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES. None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not applicable. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION. On September 16, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company determined that the Company s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the 2024 Annual Meeting will be held on Wednesday, November 20, 2024, and that the record date for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting shall be the close of business on October 14, 2024. The time and location of the 2024 Annual Meeting will be as set forth in the Company s definitive proxy statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Due to the fact that the date of the 2024 Annual Meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company is providing the due date for submission of any qualified stockholder proposal or qualified stockholder nominations.
