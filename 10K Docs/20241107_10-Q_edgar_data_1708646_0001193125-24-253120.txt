The Trust issues the Shares in blocks of at least 25,000 Shares called Baskets in exchange for gold from certain registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants (the Authorized Participants ), which is then allocated as physical gold and stored by the Custodian. The Trust issues and redeems Baskets on an ongoing basis at net asset value NAV or Net Asset Value to and from Authorized Participants who have entered into a contract with the Sponsor and the Trustee. As of September 30, 2024, each of Virtu Americas LLC and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC has signed an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee, and may create and redeem Baskets. The Trust s investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold less the expenses of the Trust s operations. The Trust is not actively-managed. The Shares trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. Cboe BZX Exchange under the symbol AAAU. Effective February 3, 2022, the listing of the Trust was transferred from NYSE Arca to Cboe BZX Exchange. The Trust s fiscal year-end is December 31. Valuation of Gold and Computation of Net Asset Value On each business day that the Cboe BZX Exchange is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. New York City time, the Trustee values the gold held by the Trust and determines the Net Asset Value of the Trust, as described below. The Net Asset Value of the Trust is the aggregate value of gold and other assets, if any, of the Trust (other than amounts credited to the Trust s reserve account, if any) including cash, if any, less liabilities of the Trust, which include estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities. The reserve account, if established, will be a separate non-interest bearing account with the Trustee or such other banking institution specified by the Sponsor, or if the Sponsor fails so to specify, as selected by the Trustee, in the name, and for the benefit, of the Trust, subject only to draft or order by the Trustee acting pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will hold in such account all cash that it has credited to such account to reflect the reserves for taxes or other governmental charges and other contingent liabilities payable out of the Trust that the Trustee has determined from time to time to be required by GAAP. The Trustee determines the Net Asset Value per Share by dividing the Net Asset Value of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange (which includes the net number of any Shares deemed created or redeemed on such evaluation day).

Table of Contents 

All gold is valued based on its fine troy ounce Fine Ounce content, calculated by multiplying the weight of gold by its purity. The same methodology is applied independent of the type of gold held by the Trust; similarly, the value of up to 430 Fine Ounces of unallocated gold the Trust may hold is calculated by multiplying the number of Fine Ounces with the price of gold determined by the Trustee. The Trustee values the gold held by the Trust based on the LBMA Gold Price PM. The LBMA Gold Price PM is set at 3:00 p.m. London time via an auction independently operated and administered by ICE Benchmark Administration IBA ). The price is set in U.S. dollars per Fine Ounce. If no LBMA Gold Price PM is available for the required day, the Trustee uses the LBMA Gold Price AM. If no LBMA Gold Price PM or LBMA Gold Price AM is available for the day, the Trustee values the Trust s gold based on the most recently announced LBMA Gold Price PM or LBMA Gold Price AM. If the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use, it must identify an alternate basis for evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. The Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to use a different price which is reasonably available to the Trustee at no cost to the Trustee that the Sponsor determines to represent fairly the commercial value of the Trust s gold. The Trustee s estimation of accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities is conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust, and no revision or correction in any computation made under the Trust Agreement is required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those actually paid. The Sponsor and the investors may rely on any evaluation or determination of any amount made by the Trustee, and, except for any determination by the Sponsor as to the price to be used to evaluate gold, the Sponsor has no responsibility for the evaluation s accuracy. The determinations the Trustee makes are made in good faith upon the basis of, and the Trustee will not be liable for any errors contained in, information reasonably available to it. The Trustee is not liable to the Sponsor, Authorized Participants, investors or any other person for errors in judgment. However, the preceding liability exclusion will not protect the Trustee against any liability resulting from bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties.

Other than the Sponsor Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume and be responsible for the payment of most of the expenses incurred by the Trust, up to a maximum amount equal to the greater of 500,000 per annum and the amount that is equal to 0.15 of the average total value of the gold held by the Trust, as determined by the Trustee on each business day, plus the value of all other assets of the Trust (other than any amount credited to the Trust s reserve account), including cash, if any. As such, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor Fee. The Sponsor Fee accrues daily based on the prior business day s NAV and is payable in cash from the Trust Property or the sale of gold in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will, when directed by the Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction may, in its discretion, sell gold in such quantity and at such times as may be necessary to permit payment in cash of the Trust s extraordinary expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Trust did not have any cash balances. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Trust did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Analysis of Movements in the Price of Gold As movements in the price of gold are expected to directly affect the price of the Trust s Shares, it is important for investors to understand and follow movements in the price of gold. Past movements in the gold price are not indicators of future movements. The following chart shows movements in the price of gold based on the LBMA PM Gold Price in U.S. dollars per ounce over the period from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024.

The Trust is a passive investment vehicle. It is not actively managed. The Trust s investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold less the expenses of the Trust s operations. Accordingly, fluctuations in the price of gold will affect the value of the Trust s Shares. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Table of Contents 

The Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor, who perform functions similar to those the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of such duly authorized officers of the Sponsor, the Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor, who perform functions similar to those the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had officers concluded that the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Trust s most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls. Part II. OTHER INFORMATION. Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Not applicable. Item 1A. Risk Factors. The operations of the Trust are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. As a result, the risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K should be carefully considered.
