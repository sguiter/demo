Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 

The following tables sets forth certain information as of December 11, 2024, with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common shares by: (1) all of our directors; (2) our named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table; (3) all of directors and executive officers as a group; and (4) each person known by us to beneficially own more than 5 of our outstanding common shares.

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC, based on a review of filings with the SEC and information known to us. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all common shares that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws.

Common shares subject to options, warrants or restricted share units currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 11, 2024 are deemed outstanding for computing the share ownership and percentage of the person holding such options, warrants and restricted share units, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of any other person.
