Bluebird Express has over of experience in providing these services, is a fully accredited cargo agent certified by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and an indirect air carrier (IAC) authorized and regulated by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The Bluebird Express acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, and, therefore, the total purchase price was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. Fair values were determined by management based in part on an independent valuation performed by a third-party valuation specialist and required the use of significant assumptions and estimates. Critical estimates included, but were not limited to, future expected cash flows, including projected revenue and expenses, and the applicable discount rates. These estimates were based on assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. We review our available-for-sale investments for other-than-temporary declines in fair value below our cost basis each quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the cost basis of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below our cost basis, as well as adverse conditions related specifically to the security such as any changes to the credit rating of the security and the intent to sell or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future based on new developments or changes in assumptions related to that particular security. Corporate debt securities Total For U.S. Treasury notes, the unrealized losses were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, except in the case of an economic reason, such as the need to support a debt repurchase

We carry the Convertible Senior Notes (see Note 11) at face value less the unamortized discount and issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets and present fair value for disclosure purposes only. We estimate the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes using the net present value of the payments, discounted at an interest rate that is consistent with market and risk-adjusted interest rates, which is a Level 2 input. 2025 Senior Notes Under the terms of the Critical Transport Solutions Australia CTSA acquisition, contingent consideration may be payable in cash based on the achievement of a certain EBITDA target for 2024, with no maximum limit as to the contingent consideration achievable.

Based on our analysis, we concluded that there has been no impairment of the goodwill associated with the CRYOPDP reporting unit as its carrying value did not exceed its estimated fair value. We further concluded that our MVE reporting unit s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, and as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of million related to full impairment of the goodwill related to the MVE reporting unit in the consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our goodwill impairment test was performed using a combination of both an income and a market approach to determine the fair value of the MVE reporting unit. The income approach utilized the estimated discounted cash flows for MVE while the market approach utilized comparable peer group information. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach included projected cash flows for MVE and a discount rate determined using a weighted average cost of capital for risk factors specific to MVE and other market and industry data. The discount rate selected was . The other key estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include, but are not limited to, revenue and EBITDA growth rates, and a terminal growth rate. The estimates and assumptions used in our assessment represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our own assumptions in measuring fair value.

We have adequate property damage and business interruption insurance under which we filed a claim with the insurance carrier. The Company received a total of million of insurance proceeds, of which the final payment of million was received in the first quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a gain of million related to business interruption insurance proceeds. Proceeds from insurance settlements, except for those directly related to investing activities, were recognized as cash inflows from operating activities. The losses related to such an event are recognized as incurred. Insurance proceeds are recorded to the extent of the losses and then, only if recovery is realized or probable. Any gains in excess of losses are recognized only when the contingencies regarding the recovery are resolved, and the amount is fixed or determinable. Employment Agreements We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our officers under which payment and benefits would become payable in the event of termination by us for any reason other than cause, or upon a change in control of our Company, or by the employee for good reason. Litigation The Company may become a party to product litigation in the normal course of business. The Company accrues for open claims based on its historical experience and available insurance coverage. We record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We also disclose material contingencies when we believe a loss is not probable but reasonably possible. Accounting for contingencies requires us to use judgment related to both the likelihood of a loss and the estimate of the amount or range of loss. The outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for a particular period. Indemnities and Guarantees The Company has made certain indemnities and guarantees, under which it may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party, in relation to certain actions or transactions. The guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, the Company has not been obligated nor incurred any payments for these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company indemnifies its directors, officers, employees and agents, as permitted under the laws of the States of California and Nevada. In connection with its facility and equipment leases, the Company has indemnified its lessors for certain claims arising from the use of the facilities and equipment. The duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies and is generally tied to the life of the agreements. authorized shares of common stock with a par value of per share, and undesignated or blank check preferred stock, with a par value of , of which shares have been designated as Class A

 - - Risk-free interest rate - - Volatility - - Dividend yield The expected option life assumption is estimated based on the simplified method as the Company s history is not indicative of future expected lives. Accordingly, the Company has utilized the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all options to calculate the expected option term. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of our employee stock options. The expected volatility is based on the average of the historical volatility and the implied volatility of our stock commensurate with the expected life of the stock-based award. We do not anticipate paying dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. We recognize stock-based compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest. Forfeitures are recorded when recognized. Total stock-based compensation expense related to all of our share-based payment awards is comprised of the following (in thousands): Selling, general and administrative Engineering and development A summary of stock option activity is as follows: Granted (weighted-average fair value of per share) Exercised ) Forfeited ) Outstanding September 30, 2024 Vested (exercisable) September 30, 2024 Expected to vest after September 30, 2024 (unexercisable)

Gross margin for our Life Sciences Products revenue was 42.1 of products revenue, as compared to 44.9 of products revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Life Sciences Products revenue, related cost of revenue and resulting gross margins were primarily driven by our MVE Biological Solutions business. Our cost of products revenue was primarily comprised of materials, direct and indirect labor, inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving, inspection, and distribution and warehousing of inventory. In addition, shop supplies, facility maintenance costs and depreciation expense for assets used in the manufacturing process were included in cost of products revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses include the costs associated with selling our services and products, costs required to support our marketing efforts including legal, accounting, patent, and shareholder services, amortization of intangible assets and other administrative functions. SG A expenses increased by 1.6 million, or 4.5 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was due to 1.3 million increase in wages and associated employee costs from 16.1 million in 2023 to 17.5 million in 2024, an increase in depreciation and amortization of 0.7 million, primarily due to additional fixed assets purchased or acquired in our recent business acquisitions, an increase of 0.6 million as a result of cost alignment and reprioritization initiatives. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 1.0 million. Engineering and development expenses . Engineering and development expenses decreased by 1.0 million, or 19.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 0.4 million in development, testing and consulting costs, and a decrease of 0.3 million in subscription fees resulting from the realignment of initiatives and related cost reductions. We continually strive to improve and expand the features of our solutions and portfolio of temperature-controlled services and products.

 Other income (expense), net . Other income (expense), net increased by 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to an increase of 2.4 million related to foreign currency due to current period net gains. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 1.2 million in short-term investment net unrealized gains. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in effective tax rates of 44.6 and negative 3.7 , respectively. The increase in tax expense and the increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher taxable foreign earnings. The effective tax rate of 44.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance that we maintain against our deferred tax assets, income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries being taxed at different rates than the U.S. federal statuary rate, and excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Paid-in-kind dividend on Series C convertible preferred stock . The paid-in-kind dividend relates to the private placement of Series C Preferred Stock with Blackstone.

Life Sciences Products revenue decreased by 14.2 million, or 20.6 , from 68.9 million to 54.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was a result of an overall decrease in demand for cryogenic systems globally, driven primarily by the APAC region, particularly in China, which commenced during the second quarter of 2023, and the Americas. Life Sciences Products revenue consists primarily of revenue from our portfolio of cryogenic stainless-steel freezers, aluminum dewars and related ancillary equipment used in the storage and transport of life sciences commodities, which includes the rapidly growing Cell and Gene Therapy market through a global network of distributors and direct client relationships. Gross margin and cost of revenue. Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 42.8 of total revenue, as compared to 43.2 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of total revenue decreased 3.4 million to 96.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 99.9 million in the same period in 2023. Gross margin for our Life Sciences Services revenue was 44.0 of services revenue, as compared to 44.1 of services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our cost of revenue is primarily comprised of freight charges, payroll and associated expenses related to our global logistics and supply chain centers, depreciation expenses of our Cryoport Express Shippers and supplies and consumables used for our solutions. Gross margin for our Life Sciences Products revenue was 40.5 of products revenue, as compared to 41.9 of products revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our cost of products revenue was primarily comprised of materials, direct and indirect labor, inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving, inspection, and distribution and warehousing of inventory. In addition, shop supplies, facility maintenance costs and depreciation expense for assets used in the manufacturing process were included in cost of products revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses include the costs associated with selling our products and services and costs required to support our marketing efforts including legal, accounting, patent, shareholder services, amortization of intangible assets and other administrative functions. SG A expenses increased by 3.9 million, or 3.6 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase is driven by the further buildout of our competencies and infrastructure to support the continuing scaling of our business and demand for Cryoport s systems and solutions and buildout of new competencies, such as the IntegriCell TM platform, a standardized integrated apheresis collection, cryopreservation and distribution solution for cell therapies. In October 2024, we announced the launch of our new state-of-the-art IntegriCell facility within our Houston campus. This offering addresses another critical aspect in optimizing the supply chain for the development and commercialization of cell-based therapies. Wages and associated employee costs increased 7.1 million from 49.3 million in 2023 to 56.4 million in 2024. Depreciation and amortization increased 1.9 million, primarily due to additional fixed assets purchased or acquired in our recent business acquisitions and the launch of Cryoportal 2 Logistics Management Platform in May 2023, an increase of 1.0 million as a result of cost alignment and reprioritization initiatives, an increase of 1.0 million related to facility and other overhead allocations and an increase of 0.9 million in public company related expenses (including legal, audit and internal control audit fees). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 5.4 million in integration and acquisition costs primarily as a result of actively exploring a strategic business opportunity in 2023 that did not occur in 2024, a decrease of 1.6 million in the change in contingent consideration and a decrease in stock compensation expense of 1.5 million. Engineering and development expenses. Engineering and development expenses increased by 0.3 million, or 2.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 0.8 million in wages and associated employee costs to add software development and engineering resources, which was partially offset by

 0.3 million of development and testing expenses. We continually strive to improve and expand the features of our solutions and portfolio of temperature-controlled services and products. Our primary developments are directed towards facilitating the safe, reliable and efficient transport and storage of life science commodities through innovative and technology-based solutions. This includes significantly enhancing our Cryoportal Logistics Management Platform and related technology solutions as well as developments to expand our Cryoport Express and Cryoport ELITE shipper fleets. We supplement our internal engineering and development resources with subject matter experts and consultants to enhance our capabilities and shorten development cycles. Impairment loss. As a result of the interim impairment assessment performed as of June 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment loss of 63.8 million, primarily related to full impairment charge of goodwill related to the MVE Biological Solutions reporting unit. Investment Income. Investment income increased by 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. Interest expense . Interest expense increased by 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. Gain on extinguishment of debt, net. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 185.0 million in principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes for a repurchase price of 163.1 million in cash, plus accrued and unpaid interest, resulting in a net gain of 18.5 million, which is net of the write off of 2.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and 0.7 million of transaction costs. Other income, net . Other income, net decreased by 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the gain on insurance claim of 2.6 million in 2023 related to the New Prague fire that did not occur in the current year and a decrease of 0.9 million for foreign currency due to current period losses. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in effective tax rates of negative 1.3 and negative 4.5 , respectively. The decrease in tax expense and increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the impairment loss and lower foreign taxable earnings for the nine month period. The negative effective tax rate of 1.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the impairment loss, changes in the valuation allowance that we maintain against our deferred tax assets, income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries being taxed at different rates than the U.S. federal statuary rate, and excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Paid-in-kind dividend on Series C convertible preferred stock . The paid-in-kind dividend relates to the private placement of Series C Preferred Stock with Blackstone. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide adjusted EBITDA and revenue at constant currency, both non-GAAP financial measures, as supplemental measures to U.S. GAAP measures regarding our operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and revenue at constant currency, should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, cost reduction initiatives, investment income, unrealized gain or loss on investments, foreign currency gain or loss, gain on insurance claim, net gain on extinguishment of debt, impairment loss, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and charges or gains resulting from non-recurring events, as applicable.

 Management believes adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure of our operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into our ongoing operating performance. Further, management and our board of directors utilize adjusted EBITDA to gain a better understanding of our comparative operating performance from period-to-period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Adjusted EBITDA is also a significant performance measure used by us in connection with our incentive compensation programs. Management believes adjusted EBITDA, when read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP financials, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating results, including results of operations, against investor and analyst financial models, identifying trends in our underlying business and performing related trend analyses, and it provides a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is presented below.

Under U.S. GAAP, revenue received in local (non-U.S. dollar) currency is translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the period presented. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. When we use the term constant currency, it means that we have translated local currency revenue for the current reporting period into U.S. dollars using the same average foreign currency exchange rates for the conversion of revenue into U.S. dollars that we used to translate local currency revenue for the comparable reporting period of the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on our results of operations and cash flow from our operations in EMEA and APAC during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our revenue would have been 0.1 million lower and in constant currency for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and cash flow from our operations in EMEA and APAC during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our revenue would have been 0.1 million higher in constant currency for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 However, we also believe that data on constant currency period-over-period changes have limitations, particularly as the currency effects that are eliminated could constitute a significant element of our revenue and could significantly impact our performance. We therefore limit our use of constant currency period-over-period changes to a measure for the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of local currency revenue into U.S. dollars. We do not evaluate our results and performance without considering both period-over-period changes in non-GAAP constant currency revenue on the one hand and changes in revenue prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP on the other. We caution the readers of this report to follow a similar approach by considering revenue on constant currency period-over-period changes only in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, changes in revenue prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in the foreseeable future and to incur operating losses in the near term while we make investments in new supply chain initiatives, geographic expansion and technology to support our anticipated growth. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and debt instruments. The Company s management recognizes that the Company may need to obtain additional capital to fund its operations and potential acquisitions until sustained profitable operations are achieved. Additional funding plans may include obtaining additional capital through equity and/or debt funding sources. No assurance can be given that additional capital, if needed, will be available when required or upon terms acceptable to the Company. The Company s management believes that, based on its current plans and assumptions, the current cash and cash equivalents on hand, short-term investments, together with projected cash flows, will satisfy our operational and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.

 Operating activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash used in operating activities of 10.8 million reflects the net loss of 96.1 million offset by non-cash expenses of 91.0 million primarily comprised of 63.8 million impairment loss, 22.9 million of depreciation and amortization, 15.3 million of stock-based compensation, 4.4 million of non-cash operating lease expense, and a loss on available-for-sale investments of 4.0 million, which was partially offset by a gain on the extinguishment of debt of 18.5 million. Also contributing to the cash impact of our net operating loss, excluding non-cash items was a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 4.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of 3.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 1.1 million, and a decrease in net deferred tax liability of 0.4 million, which were partially offset by a decrease in inventories of 2.7 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 0.5 million. Investing activities Net cash provided by investing activities of 173.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the maturity of short-term investments of 240.0 million which was partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of 50.7 million, and facility expansions (including leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment) and additional purchases of Cryoport Express Shippers, Smart Pak II TM Condition Monitoring Systems, freezers and computer equipment for 12.0 million. Financing activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled 163.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of 163.8 million paid for the repurchase of 2026 Senior Notes, partially offset by proceeds of 0.6 million from the exercise of stock options. Repurchase Program In March 2022, Company s Board of Directors authorized a Repurchase Program through December 31, 2025, authorizing the repurchase of common stock and/or convertible senior notes in the amount of up to 100.0 million from time to time, on the open market or otherwise, in such quantities, at such prices, and in such manner as determined by the Company s management at its discretion (the 2022 Repurchase Program ). The size and timing of any repurchase will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company s common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. In July 2024, May 2024 and September 2023, the Company repurchased 15.0 million, 10.0 million and 31.3 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes for a repurchase price of 12.9 million, 8.7 million and 25.0 million, respectively, in cash under the 2022 Repurchase Plan. In August 2024, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a Repurchase Program through December 31, 2027, authorizing the repurchase of common stock and/or convertible senior notes in the amount of up to 200.0 million from time to time, on the open market or otherwise, in such quantities, at such prices, and in such manner as determined by the Company s management at its discretion (the 2024 Repurchase Program and, with the 2022 Repurchase Program, the Repurchase Programs ). The size and timing of any repurchase will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company s common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. Also in August 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 160.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes for a repurchase price of 141.6 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest under the 2024 Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately 186.2 million in principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes outstanding and has approximately 73.9 million of repurchase authorization available under the Repurchase Programs. There were no shares repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately 200.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes and 2026 Senior Notes outstanding and has approximately 73.9 million of repurchase authorization available under the Repurchase Programs.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing when interest rates are declining and declining when interest rates are increasing. We invest our excess cash in high investment grade money market funds and investment grade short to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes was 178.5 million. For additional information about the Convertible Senior Notes, see Note 11 in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Foreign Exchange Risk We operate in the United States and other foreign countries, which creates exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international business are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding subsidiaries and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, Chinese Yuan, and Indian Rupee. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally focused business are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, revenues and other operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record material gain or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues from our international business, which accounted for 38 of our consolidated revenues, decreased by 0.2 million in comparison with the same period in the prior year as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates is derived by applying the average currency rates for the same period of the prior year to the current period revenues. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash and cash equivalents. Based on the foreign-denominated cash balance as of September 30, 2024 of 32.5 million, an assumed 5 , 10 , and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of 1.6 million, 3.3 million, and 6.5 million, respectively, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , a separate component of stockholders equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our long and short-term foreign-denominated intercompany loan balances. Based on the long-term intercompany loan balances as of September 30, 2024, an assumed 5 , 10 , and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 4.7 million, 9.5 million, and 19.0 million, respectively, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Based on the short-term intercompany loan balances as of September 30, 2024, an assumed 5 , 10 , and 20 adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of 4.1 million, 8.1 million, and 16.2 million, respectively, reported as Other income (expense), net . ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to various legal proceedings and disputes, including product liability claims. We currently are not aware of any such legal proceedings or claim that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or cash flows. It is our practice to accrue for open claims based on our historical experience and available insurance coverage. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2023 Annual Report, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors do not identify all of the risks that we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Recent Sale of Unregistered Securities There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable ITEM 5.
