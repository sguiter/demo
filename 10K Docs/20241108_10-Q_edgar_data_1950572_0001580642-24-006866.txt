FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about BIP Ventures Evergreen BDC (the Company , we , us , our ), current and prospective portfolio investments, industry, beliefs and the Company s assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company s control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including: 

our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

the effect of investments that we expect to make and the competition for those investments; 

our ability to raise capital; 

geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war; 

general economic, logistical and political trends and other external factors, including pandemics and supply chain disruptions; 

potential economic downturns, interest rate volatility, loss of key personnel, and the illiquid nature of investments; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our current and expected financing arrangements and investments; 

changes in the general interest rate environment; 

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Company s investment adviser, and its affiliates; 

the elevating levels of inflation, and its impact on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 

the impact on our business of U.S. and international financial reform legislation, rules and regulations; and 

the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations thereof. 

Although the Company believes that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In addition, new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on the Company s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation that the Company s plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, the Company assumes no duty and does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements.

per share (the Shares ), in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The Shares are being offered solely to investors that are accredited investors as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. 

The Shares to be issued under the Private Offering will be unlimited and have a par value of per Share. The initial offering price for the Shares was per Share. Thereafter, Shares are sold at the then-current net asset value NAV per Share. 

The Company was initially funded on July 12, 2023, when the Investment Adviser purchased Shares of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of , and subsequently commenced operations on July 13, 2023 Commencement of Operations ). The Company completed its initial closing of capital commitments on August 24, 2023 and subsequently broke escrow and commenced investment activity. 

Independent valuation firms are engaged by the Investment Adviser to conduct independent reviews to provide positive assurance on a rotational, sample basis by reviewing the Investment Adviser s valuations and making their own independent assessment; 

The Investment Adviser discusses valuations and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in the portfolio based on input of the Valuation Committee and the applicable independent valuation firm; and 

The Audit Committee oversees the valuation designee, and will report to the Board on any valuation matters requiring the Board s attention. 

This valuation process is conducted on a quarterly basis. 

ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC 820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below: 

Level 1 Valuations are based on unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Valuations are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 Valuations are based on inputs
that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Investment Adviser applies the valuation policy approved by the Company s Board that is consistent with ASC 820. 

Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 

In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 

; and (ii) 1.50 of the Company s average net assets if the Company s total net asset balance is equal to or greater than 500,000,000. The average net asset balance will be the average of the Company s total net assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Board will assess the base Management Fee and has the discretion to reduce the base Management Fee or grant a temporary waiver of the fee if determined to be appropriate. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company recorded a base Management Fee expense of and
 , respectively. For the period from July 13, 2023 Commencement of Operations through September 30,
2023, the Company recorded a base Management Fee expense of . The Company has recorded a base Management Fee payable of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively. 

Incentive Fee : 

The Incentive Fee is payable at the end of each
calendar year in arrears and equals 20 of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, plus interest received on portfolio assets,
from the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC to the end of each calendar year, less cumulative aggregate
realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Incentive
Fee. The Company will accrue quarterly, but will not pay, the Incentive Fee with respect to net unrealized appreciation. The
Incentive Fee will only be paid on assets that have been partially or fully sold. 

In determining the Incentive Fee payable to the
Investment Adviser, the Company will calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital
losses since the Company s inception, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable,
with respect to each of the investments in the Company s portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains,
if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the original cost of such investment
since the Company s inception. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net sales
price of each investment, when sold, is less than the original cost of such investment since the Company s inception. The net sales
price shall include all cash received related to the portfolio asset, including amounts recorded as interest income on convertible notes
or debt investments, throughout the asset s life. The original cost shall include all cash that was deployed into the portfolio
asset, which would not include converted interest on convertible notes or PIK on debt investments. Cumulative aggregate realized capital
gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses will only include cash flows associated with assets that have been sold. Aggregate
unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the difference, if negative, between the valuation of each investment as of the applicable
calculation date and the original cost of such investment. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that serves
as the basis for the Company s calculation of the Incentive Fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative
aggregate realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to the Company s portfolio of investments. 

As of July 1, 2024, the Advisory Agreement was amended to clarify that interest received on portfolio assets is included in the net sales
price when the asset is sold. This clarification is being applied as of July 1, 2024 on a prospective basis. 

The Company has recorded an Incentive Fee of
 
and 
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and for the period from July 13, 2023 Commencement of Operations through September 30, 2023. The Company has recorded an Incentive Fee payable of 
and 
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 

The Company entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Investment Adviser, whereby the Investment Adviser has agreed to pay all of the Company s organization and offering costs related to the Private Offering of its Shares. The Company has agreed to reimburse the Investment Adviser for such advanced expenses up to when the Company has raised million from unaffiliated subscribers. 

As of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, the Investment Adviser has incurred reimbursable organizational expenses and offering costs of 
and ,
respectively, that will be payable when the Company has raised 250 million of capital. As the Company has not raised capital of
 250 million as of September 30, 2024, reimbursement of organization and offering costs was deemed not probable and therefore,
is not recorded as a liability. No organizational and offering costs were incurred during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, nor the period from July 13, 2023 Commencement of Operations through September 30, 2023. 

Co-Investment Activity 

On March 5, 2024, the Company and the Investment Adviser received an exemptive order from the SEC (the Order that permits the Company to, among other things, co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliates of the Investment Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions. Negotiated co-investments may be made by the Company only in accordance with the Order. Non-negotiated co-investments may be made by the Company only in accordance with the conditions set forth in the no-action letter, dated June 7, 2000, issued by the SEC s Division of Investment Management to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (the MassMutual No Action Letter ). For a co-investment transaction subject to the Order, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company s independent trustees must be able to reach certain conclusions in connection with such co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the Company and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s shareholders and is consistent with the Company s then-current investment objectives and strategies. In certain situations where a potential co-investment with one or more funds managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates is not permitted by the Order or in reliance on the MassMutual No Action Letter, the personnel of the Investment Adviser or its affiliates will decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Such personnel will make these determinations based on allocation policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably ensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Co-investments made pursuant to the Order or in reliance on the MassMutual No Action Letter are subject to certain terms and conditions, so there can be no assurance that the Company will be permitted to co-invest with certain of its affiliates other than in the circumstances currently permitted by regulatory guidance or the Order. 

On March 21, 2024, the Company made an investment of million into CareSave Technologies, Inc. s (d/b/a ShiftMed) preferred Series E-2 equity financing round as part of a co-investment transaction with an affiliated fund in reliance on the MassMutual No-Action Letter. On April 18, 2024, the Company made an additional investment of million into ShiftMed s preferred Series E-2 equity financing round as part of the same co-investment transaction which occurred on March 21, 2024. The Company had not entered into any co-investment transactions as of December 31, 2023.

Distributions 

The Company did not make any cash distributions to its shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or for the period from July 13, 2023 Commencement of Operations through September 30, 2023. 

Share Repurchase Program 

The Company does not intend to list its Shares on a securities exchange and does not expect there to be a public market for its Shares. 

Three years after the date on which the Company broke
escrow for the initial Private Offering of Shares, which was on August 24, 2023, and at the discretion of the Board, the Company
intends to commence a share repurchase program in which it intends to repurchase annually between 4 and 9 of outstanding Shares (by
number of Shares). Under the share repurchase program, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase Shares during an annual period,
the Company expects to repurchase Shares pursuant to tender offers as of the applicable quarter-end using a purchase price equal to the
NAV per Share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one
year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained
by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. The repurchase request period will be 20 days after the repurchase offer has
been announced. The repurchase of Shares will not occur until at least 60 days after the shareholder has notified the Company in writing
of their intention to tender. Further, the repurchase price will not be established until at least 60 days after receipt of the shareholder s
intention to tender. 

The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of its shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on liquidity, adversely affect operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, Share repurchases may not be available annually. Should the Board suspend the share repurchase program, the Board will consider whether the continued suspension of the program is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders on a quarterly basis. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. 

The Company did not make any share repurchases
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or for the period from July 13, 2023 Commencement of Operations through September 30, 2023.

Overview 

BIP Ventures Evergreen BDC (the Company, 
 we, us, or our is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company
focused on investing in a portfolio consisting of common and preferred equity investments, including convertible notes, in target U.S.-based
portfolio companies, which qualify as eligible portfolio companies under the 1940 Act. The Company has elected to be regulated
as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, the Company intends to be taxed as a partnership under the Code. 

The Company intends to achieve its investment
objectives by investing at least 70 of the Company s total assets (including the amount of borrowings for investment purposes)
in portfolio companies that qualify as eligible portfolio companies under the 1940 Act, with its core focus on investments in sectors
including, but not limited to, healthcare IT, fintech, enterprise SaaS, software tools, frontier technology, media technology, and technology-enabled
marketplaces. The Company may also invest in other strategies and opportunities from time to time that it views as attractive. 

The Company anticipates conducting one or more
private placements of its Shares to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The
Company expects to enter into separate Subscription Agreements with a number of investors in each Private Offering. Subscriptions will
be effective only upon the Company s acceptance, and the Company reserves the right to reject any subscription in whole or in part.
All purchases will be made at a per-Share price as determined by the Board (including any committee thereof). The per-Share price shall
be at least equal to the NAV per Share. The Board (including any committee thereof) may set the per-Share price above the NAV per Share
based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, to ensure that investors acquiring Shares in the Company after other investors
have already done so are apportioned their pro rata portion of the Company s organizational and offering expenses. 

The Company was initially funded on July 12,
2023 when the Investment Adviser purchased 400 Shares of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of 10,000. The Company completed
its initial closing of capital commitments on August 24, 2023 and subsequently broke escrow and commenced investment activity. As
part of the initial close, the Company issued 1,389,142 Shares for total proceeds of 34,728,548 as payment for such Shares. 

Key Components of Our Results of Operations 

Investments 

We invest primarily in common and preferred equity
investments, including convertible notes, in U.S.-based private companies in sectors including, but not limited to, healthcare IT, fintech,
enterprise SaaS, software tools, frontier technology, media technology, and technology-enabled marketplaces. 

The Company s level of investment activity
can and is expected to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of capital available to
target portfolio companies, the general economic environment, and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 

21 

Revenues 

The Company generates revenue primarily in the
form of capital gains on our equity investments in our portfolio companies. We also generate revenue in the form of interest or dividends
on these investments as well as interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held at financial institutions. 

Expenses 

Operating Expenses 

The Investment Adviser shall bear its own costs
incurred in providing investment advisory services to the Company, including all personnel expenses. The Company will be responsible for
all costs and expenses relating to the Company s activities, investments and ongoing business, including: 

all costs and expenses attributable to acquiring or originating, holding, and disposing of investments; 

the actual costs incurred by the Investment Adviser or third party engaged by the Investment Adviser in
connection with management and servicing of the Company s investments, as applicable, provided that the Company s responsibility
for such costs shall be limited to an amount that is usual and customary for the provision of such services in the geographic area of
the investment, as applicable; 

legal, accounting, auditing, banking, consulting, and other fees and expenses, including reimbursement
to the Investment Adviser for the cost of specific services provided by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates, which would otherwise
be provided by third party experts such as tax and legal services; 

all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company, the Investment Adviser, or their
respective affiliates, partners, agents, officers, and employees relating to the investigation of investment, syndication, and investment
repayment opportunities for the Company, whether or not consummated, and the fees and expenses of due diligence associated therewith; 

the fees payable to the Investment Adviser, or any of their respective affiliates for services provided,
including the base management fee and incentive fee; 

any taxes, fees, and other governmental charges levied against the Company; and 

all other expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser or any of its affiliates in connection with administering
the Company s business, including expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser, or any of its affiliates in performing administrative
services for the Company, and the cost of any third-party service providers, including any sub-administrator, transfer agent, or custodian
engaged to assist the Investment Adviser or any of its affiliates with the provision of administrative services for the Company or on
the Company s behalf. 

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may
pay third-party providers of goods or services. The Company will reimburse the Investment Adviser for any such amounts paid on the Company s
behalf. 

Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement
Agreement 

The Company entered into an Expense Support and
Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Investment Adviser, whereby the Investment Adviser has agreed to pay all of the Company s
organization and offering costs related to the Private Offering of its Shares. The Company has agreed to reimburse the Investment Adviser
for such advanced expenses up to 500,000 when the Company has raised 250 million from unaffiliated subscribers. 

22 

As of September 30, 2024, the Investment
Adviser has incurred reimbursable organizational expenses and offering costs of 364,014 and 135,986, respectively, that will be payable
when the Company has raised 250 million of capital. As the Company has not raised capital of 250 million as of September 30, 2024,
reimbursement of organization and offering costs was deemed not probable and therefore, is not recorded as a liability. These costs were
incurred by the Investment Adviser prior to the Commencement of Operations and as such, are not presented on the statements of operations
as an expense and corresponding waiver of expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or for the period from July 13,
2023 Commencement of Operations through September 30, 2023. 

Portfolio and Investment Activity

2024, the Company acquired 6.0 million and 19.1 million aggregate principal amount of investments, respectively, as further described
below.

follow-on investment of 1.1 million into Peregrine Health, Inc. s Peregrine Health preferred Series A-2 equity
financing round. As part of this transaction, the Company s prior investment was converted from Series A-1 to Series A-2. As of

stock in ShiftMed. ShiftMed is a technology-enabled marketplace within the healthcare industry designed to connect skilled workers (caregivers
and nurses) with available shifts at acute and post-acute care facilities. A recent product launch, ShiftMed Flex, positions the company
as a broader workforce solution platform, handling both internal and external employees for their customers. The platform makes it easier
for facilities to staff shifts, which drives compliance and quality of care.

an additional 2.5 million into senior secured convertible notes of Mediafly, Inc. Mediafly ), bringing the total investment

The Investment Adviser monitors our portfolio
companies on an ongoing basis, including financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective
business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. The Investment Adviser has several
methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 

assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan, underwriting expectations,
and financial projections; 

periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management to discuss financial position, requirements
and accomplishments; 

participation at Board meetings through a designated seat or as an observer; 

comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 

review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial metrics for portfolio companies.

Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) 

We value our portfolio
investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. Net change in unrealized gain (loss) was
composed of the following: 

For the 
Three Months Ended September 30, 
2024 
 For the 
Nine Months Ended September 30, 
2024 
 For the period 
July 13, 2023 Commencement of 
Operations through September 30, 
2023 
 
 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments 
 2,898,382 
 8,381,674 
 934,509 
 
 Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments 
 2,898,382 
 8,381,674 
 934,509 

The net change in unrealized
gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period from July 13, 2023 Commencement of Operations through September 30, 2023 was due to the appreciation of value in the Company s portfolio investments.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

The Company generates cash primarily from the
proceeds of any offering of Shares and from cash flows from proceeds from sales of its investments. It may also fund a portion of its
investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before it has fully invested the proceeds of the
Private Offering. While credit facilities are permitted to be utilized, we do not expect them to be a large portion of the funding of
investments. The primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of expenses and payment of cash distributions
to shareholders. 

Net Assets 

In connection with the formation, the Company
has the authority to issue unlimited common shares, 0.01 per Share par value. On July 12, 2023, the Investment Adviser purchased
400 Shares to capitalize the Company. On August 24, 2023, the Company accepted subscription requests, broke escrow, and commenced
investment activities.

Borrowings 

The Company does not have any debt obligations
nor any preferred shares as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As such, the Company is in compliance with the 200 
asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may
commit to an investment on behalf of the investment vehicles it manages, including the Company. Certain terms of these investments are
not finalized at the time of the commitment and each respective investment vehicle s allocation may change prior to the date of
funding. In this regard, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had
no investments that were committed but not yet funded. 

From time to time, the Company may become a party
to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
management was not aware of any pending or threatened litigation. 

28 

Related Party Transactions

Investment activity 

On October 15, 2024, the Company invested
an additional 1.0 million into senior secured convertible notes of Mediafly, Inc. The follow-on investment has the same terms as the
other outstanding senior secured convertible notes. 

The Company s Investment Committee has approved investments into
two opportunities that are expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024 as described below: 

A follow-on investment into Peregrine Health, Inc. was approved to continue to accelerate their launch of their comprehensive technology-enabled
behavioral health platform. 

An initial investment into Pointivo, Inc. Pointivo was approved to further fuel growth as Pointivo executes a recently
signed contract with a Fortune 500 company. Pointivo operates drones that enable users to capture images to create detailed digital twins,
which are then analyzed through the use of data analytics to provide valuable insights. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of the financial statements requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Change in the economic
environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 

Valuation of Investments 

The Company
values its investments, upon which its NAV is based, in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 ),
which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 also provides a framework for measuring fair value, establishes
a fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs used to measure fair value, and prescribes disclosure requirements for fair
value measurements. 

29 

Pursuant
to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Investment Adviser as the valuation designee responsible for valuing
all of the Company s investments, including making fair valuation determinations as needed. The Investment Adviser has established
a valuation committee (the Valuation Committee to carry out the ongoing fair valuation responsibilities and has adopted
policies and procedures to govern the fair valuation of the Company s investments. 

Investments
for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the bid price of those market quotations. To validate market
quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number
of the quotations. Investments that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case f or
substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Investment Adviser, as valuation designee,
based on, among other things, the input of the Valuation Committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s). 

As part
of the valuation process, the Investment Adviser takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments,
including, but not limited to: 

the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the
total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity); 

the nature and realizable value of any collateral or expected cash
proceeds upon exit; 

recent transactions of the portfolio company or peers; 

the assessment of the portfolio company in adhering to its business
plan, underwriting expectations, and financial projections; 

the markets in which the portfolio company does business; 

a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any
similar publicly traded securities; 

overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit
markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future; and 

when an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering
or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Investment Adviser considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its
valuation and may be incorporated into the valuation of our investments. 

With respect to investments
for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, the Investment
Adviser, as valuation designee, has approved a multi-step valuation process that will be performed on a quarterly basis, as described
below: 

The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued
by the Investment Adviser in consideration of the factors noted above; 

Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented, discussed with, and reviewed by the Valuation Committee
of the Investment Adviser; 

Independent valuation firms are engaged by the Investment Adviser to conduct independent reviews to provide
positive assurance on a rotational, sample basis by reviewing the Investment Adviser s valuations and making their own independent
assessment; 

30 

The Investment Adviser discusses valuations and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment
in the portfolio based on input of the Valuation Committee and the applicable independent valuation firm; and 

The Audit Committee oversees the valuation designee, and will report to the Board on any valuation matters
requiring the Board s attention. 

This valuation
process is conducted on a quarterly basis. 

ASC 820
specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.
ASC 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect
of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information
used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC 820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below: 

Level 1
 Valuations are based on unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at
the measurement date. 

Level 2
 Valuations are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either
directly or indirectly. 

Level 3
 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized
at the beginning of the period in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply
the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. 

Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining
the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from
period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used
had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such
investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale.
If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize amounts that are different from
the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 

In addition, changes in the market environment
and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments
to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 

Our accounting
policy regarding the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and
requires the use of estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining fair value measurements, the fair values of our investments
may differ from the amounts that we ultimately realize or collect from sales or maturities of our investments, and the differences could
be material. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of an investment may cause the
gains or losses ultimately realized on our investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 

31 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

We are subject to financial market risks, including
valuation risk and interest rate risk. 

Valuation Risk 

We have invested, and plan to continue to invest,
primarily in illiquid equity and debt securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market
price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Investment Adviser, based on, among other things,
input from independent third-party valuation firms engaged to review our investments. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the
fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period
to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready
market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments
are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we are
required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which
we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may
cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on our investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the
valuations currently recorded. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest
rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates, including changes due to
inflation. Our current portfolio of investments includes fixed rate convertible notes and are short-term in nature. We do not have any
debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Significant changes in interest rates could impact the ability
of our portfolio companies to meet their debt obligations or could impact our ability to negotiate transactions, both positively and negatively. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b)
and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Based on that evaluation,
we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that
such information was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of such possible controls and procedures. 

(b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

32
