Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause the Company s actual results, performance (financial or operating), or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements not to occur or be realized. Such forward looking statements generally are based upon the Company s best estimates of future results, performance or achievement, based upon current conditions and the most recent results of operations. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, expect, believe, estimate, anticipate, continue, or similar terms, variations of those terms or the negative of those terms. Potential risks and uncertainties include, among other things, such factors as: while the Company had net income for the first three quarters of 2024 and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 there are no assurances that the Company can remain profitable in future periods; in line with this risk, the Company incurred a loss from operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, while we have expended significant funds in recent years to increase manufacturing capacity and the barrier rental fleet, and plan to continue to increase manufacturing capacity, there is no assurance that we will achieve significantly greater revenues, we have a substantial amount of debt and our ability to satisfy and meet our debt obligations cannot be assured, our cash significantly reduced during the first quarter of 2024 from December 31, 2023 reflecting the increase in capital expenditures and accounts receivables and there can be no assurance that the Company s cash will not be further reduced, our accounts receivables has increased during through the first quarter of 2024 and during 2023, and our ability to fully collect accounts receivable balances cannot be assured, we identified material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reports related to (i) the review procedures applied to the estimation of the allowance for credit losses; in this respect, we have designed and implemented enhanced control activities and management is still measuring the effectiveness of this process to determine proper remediation, and (ii) the review and posting of general ledger entries; in this respect, we are actively exploring potential functionality available with our general ledger system, as well as monitoring controls to effectively mitigate this weakness, our future revenue growth depends in part on future government spending on infrastructure, and there can be no assurance that such spending will occur or be in significant amounts, the continued availability of financing in the amounts, at the times, and on the terms required, to support our future business and capital projects, cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations; in this respect, we experienced a wire fraud incident in the second quarter of 2023, the extent to which we are successful in developing, acquiring, licensing, or securing patents for proprietary products, changes in economic conditions specific to any one or more of our markets (including the availability of public funds and grants for construction), the Company s operations in 2023 were adversely impacted by inflation in the purchase of raw materials such as cement and aggregates, steel, and also with labor costs, changes in general economic conditions in our primary service areas, adverse weather, which inhibits the demand for our products, or the installation or completion of projects, our compliance with governmental regulations, the outcome of future litigation, if any, potential decreases in our contract backlog, our ability to produce and install product on material construction projects that conforms to contract specifications and in a time frame that meets the contract requirements, the cyclical nature of the construction industry, our exposure to increased interest expense payments should interest rates change, and other factors and information disclosed and discussed in other sections of this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and shareholders should carefully consider such risks, uncertainties and other information, disclosures and discussions that contain cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those provided in the forward-looking statements.

The Company's customers are primarily general contractors and federal, state, and local transportation authorities located in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions and in parts of the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. The Company's operating strategy has involved producing innovative and proprietary products, including SlenderWall , a patented, lightweight, energy-efficient concrete and steel exterior insulated wall panel for use in building construction; J-J Hooks Highway Safety Barrier, a positive-connected highway safety barrier; and Easi-Set transportable concrete buildings, also patented. In addition, the Company produces custom order precast concrete products with various architectural surfaces, as well as generic highway sound barriers, utility vaults, and farm products such as cattleguards. The Company was incorporated in Delaware on August 2, 1994. Prior to a corporate reorganization completed in October 1994, the Company conducted its business primarily through Smith-Midland Virginia, which was incorporated in 1960 as Smith Cattleguard Company, a Virginia corporation, and subsequently changed its name to Smith-Midland Corporation in 1985. The Company s principal offices are located at 5119 Catlett Road, Midland, Virginia 22728 and its telephone number is (540) 439-3266. As used in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, the term the Company refers to Smith-Midland Corporation and its subsidiaries. As a part of the construction industry, the Company's sales and net income may vary greatly from quarter to quarter over a given year. Because of the cyclical nature of the construction industry, many factors not under our control, such as weather and project delays, affect the Company's production schedule, possibly causing momentary slowdowns in sales and net income. In addition, revenues are affected by the number, size, and timing of significant projects to which the Company is contracted. As a result of these factors, the Company is not always able to earn a profit for each period, therefore, please read Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the accompanying financial statements with these factors in mind. 15 Table of Contents Results of Operations (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) Overall, the Company s financial bottom line performance was higher for the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the first nine months of 2023. The Company had net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3,150 and 6,278, respectively, compared to net income of 1,266 and 565 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Total revenue increased by 7,931 to 23,582 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15,651 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total revenue increased by 16,786 to 59,977 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 43,191 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue is mainly from an increase in architectural sales, utility sales, miscellaneous product sales, barrier rentals, and shipping and installation revenue. In particular, revenue and net income significantly increased in the more recent periods due to special barrier rental projects occurring in the third quarter of 2024. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, not including royalties, decreased to 75 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 81 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, not including royalties, decreased to 77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 86 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the increased production volumes which increased the absorption of overhead costs, as well as to a more favorable product mix. Operating income was 3,848 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to operating income of 1,502 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. Operating income was 8,031 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to operating income of 576 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 2,730 compared to 2,075 for the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were 7,593 compared to 6,953 for the first nine months of 2023. Income tax expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was 694, or an effective tax rate of 18 , as compared to income tax expense of 247, or an effective tax rate of 16 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was 1,683, or an effective tax rate of 21 , as compared to income tax expense of 160, or an effective tax rate of 22 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. As of November 1, 2024, the Company s sales backlog was approximately 62.8 million, as compared to approximately 60.2 million around the same time in the prior year. It is estimated that most of the projects in the current sales backlog will be produced within 12 months, but a few will be produced over multiple years. The Company anticipates funding related to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to begin coming through the state and local governments for the remainder of 2024 and beyond to further promote growth in the revenue related to the highway, transportation, and infrastructure markets, although no assurance can be provided. The Company continues to increase marketing and sales efforts towards SlenderWall sales and barrier rentals, in line with long-term strategic objectives. 16 Table of Contents Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 Revenue includes product sales, barrier rentals, royalty income, and shipping and installation revenues. Product sales are further divided into soundwall, architectural and SlenderWall panels, miscellaneous wall panels, highway barrier, Easi-Set buildings, utility products, and miscellaneous precast products. The following table summarizes the sales by product type and comparison for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Revenue by Type Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Soundwall Sales 1,873 2,361 7,043 5,085 Architectural Panel Sales 1,601 315 3,893 1,044 SlenderWall Sales 2,299 5,066 Miscellaneous Wall Sales 811 1,442 4,634 5,580 Barrier Sales 546 1,417 3,418 6,000 Easi-Set Building Sales 1,801 1,226 4,341 3,675 Utility Sales 2,383 891 6,112 1,787 Miscellaneous Sales 1,738 947 5,180 1,605 Total Product Sales 10,753 10,898 34,621 29,842 Barrier Rentals 7,053 784 9,303 2,604 Royalty Income 958 822 2,403 1,827 Shipping and Installation Revenue 4,818 3,147 13,650 8,918 Total Service Revenue 12,829 4,753 25,356 13,349 Total Revenue 23,582 15,651 59,977 43,191 The revenue items: soundwall sales, architectural panel sales, SlenderWall sales, miscellaneous wall sales, miscellaneous sales, barrier rentals, and royalty income are recognized as revenue over time. The revenue items: barrier sales, Easi-Set and Easi-Span building sales, utility sales, and shipping and installation revenue are recognized as revenue at a point in time. Soundwall Sales - Soundwall sales were lower for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is due to lower production at the North Carolina and South Carolina plants reflecting less soundwall projects than in the prior year period. Soundwall sales were significantly higher for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is due to higher production volumes at all three plants, as the Company increased production output to execute and deliver on the Company s increased backlog. Soundwall sales are expected to trend similarly throughout the remainder 2024 as compared to the first three quarters of 2024, although no assurance can be given. Architectural Panel Sales - Architectural panel sales increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is related to production of two architectural projects that started production at the end of the first quarter of 2024. Architectural sales are expected to trend higher throughout 2024 as compared to the full year 2023, although no assurance can be given. SlenderWall Sales - SlenderWall sales decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. A SlenderWall project was in production during the first half of 2023 and the Company did not have a SlenderWall project in production during the first nine months of 2024. The Company continues to focus sales initiatives on SlenderWall, but no assurance can be given as to the success of this endeavor. 17 Table of Contents Miscellaneous Wall Sales - Miscellaneous wall sales decreased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Miscellaneous wall sales were slightly down due to lower production volumes in the second and third quarters of 2024 as compared to 2023. Miscellaneous wall sales are expected to trend similarly throughout 2024 as the first three quarters of 2024, although no assurance can be provided. Barrier Sales - Barrier sales decreased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease is due to the completion of large barrier projects in North Carolina and South Carolina during 2023. Barrier sales are expected to trend similarly for the last quarter of 2024 as compared to the first the quarters of 2024, although no assurance can be given. The Company continues to shift marketing efforts from barrier sales to barrier rentals in the Delaware to Virginia region. Easi-Set and Easi-Span Building Sales - Building and restroom sales increased slightly for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due to increased building sales at all manufacturing plants. Building and restroom sales are expected to continue to trend similarly throughout the remainder of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2024. Utility Sales - Utility sales increased significantly for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The Company has seen a surge in demand for utility vaults in the Northern Virginia market to support data center growth in this market. Utility sales are expected to trend similarly for the remainder of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2024, although no assurance can be provided. Miscellaneous Product Sales - Miscellaneous products are products that are produced or sold that do not meet the criteria defined for other revenue categories. Examples would include precast concrete slabs, concrete blocks, or small add-on items. Miscellaneous product sales increased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is mainly from the Virginia plant that started production on one large project for the production of precast beams and platforms. Miscellaneous product sales are expected to trend lower for the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the first three quarters of 2024, although no assurance can be given. Barrier Rentals Barrier rentals increased significantly for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. This increase is attributed to an increase in utilization of rental barrier and the close-out of the buy-back agreement. Barrier rental revenue also increased due to multiple special barrier projects occurring and completed during the third quarter 2024. Barrier rental revenue, excluding revenue from special barrier projects, is expected to trend higher throughout 2024 as compared to the first three quarters of 2024, although no assurance can be given. Revenues from special barrier projects, if any, are expected to decrease due to the completion of projects in the third quarter of 2024. Royalty Income Royalties increased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is related to higher barrier production volumes experienced by the Company s licensees. It is expected that infrastructure spending and the start of production by licensees of a new, low profile barrier that utilizes the J-J Hook system, will continue to drive royalties. The Company expects royalties for 2024 to exceed royalty income for the full year 2023, although no assurance can be given. Shipping and Installation Shipping revenue results from shipping our products to the customers' final destination and is recognized when the shipping services take place. Installation activities include installation of our products at the customers construction site. Installation revenue results when attaching architectural wall panels to a building, installing an Easi-Set or Easi-Span building at a customers' site, setting highway barrier, or setting any of our other precast products at a site specific to the requirements of the owner. Shipping and installation revenues increased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is mainly attributed to the increase in shipping and installation of SlenderWall and architectural panels. This increase in shipping and installation revenue correlates with the increased production of SlenderWall panels that occurred, and for which revenue was previously recognized, throughout 2023. 18 Table of Contents Cost of Sales - Total cost of sales as a percent of revenue, excluding royalties, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 75 , as compared to 81 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total cost of sales as a percent of revenue, excluding royalties, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 77 , as compared to 86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, not including royalties, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is due to the increase in overall production volumes, which increased the absorption of overhead costs. The Company also had multiple short-term special barrier rental projects occurring in the third quarter 2023, which historically carry slightly higher margins due to the nature of the projects. In addition, the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, not including royalties, decreased due to production throughout the first half of 2024 related to contracts that factored in the rising inflationary costs experienced throughout 2022 and 2023, and a one-time expense related to panels the Company chose to remake for one specific customer related to defective steel from a supplier used in the initial product in 2023. General and Administrative Expenses - For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's general and administrative expenses increased to 1,720 from 1,187 during the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's general and administrative expenses increased to 4,938 from 4,420 during the same period in 2023. General and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 7 and 8 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. General and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 8 and 10 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such expenses increased due to higher salary and wage rates, and the increase in the allowance for credit losses. Selling Expenses - Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 1,010 from 888 for the same period in 2023. The slight increase is due to additional salaries and wages during in 2024. Selling expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2,655 and 2,533, respectively. The Company expects selling expenses to increase in future periods with the plan for additional sales associates and increased advertising spending aligning with the strategy to increase SlenderWall sales and barrier rentals. Operating Income (Loss) - The Company had operating income for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 of 3,848 compared to operating income of 1,502 for the same period in 2023. The Company had operating income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 of 8,031 compared to operating income of 576 for the same period in 2023. The increase is mainly due to the increase in revenue and decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenue. Interest Expense - Interest expense was 56 and 64 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense was 175 and 192 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company expects interest expense for the full year of 2024 to be lower compared to the full year of 2023 due to the decrease in level of indebtedness. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) - The Company had an income tax expense of 694, or an effective tax rate of 18 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 247, or an effective tax rate of 16 for the same period in 2023. The Company had an income tax expense of 1,683, or an effective tax rate of 21 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 160, or an effective tax rate of 22 for the same period in 2023. Net Income (Loss) - The Company had net income of 3,150 and 6,278 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to net income of 1,266 and 565 for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The basic and diluted earnings per share was 0.59 and 1.18, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the basic and diluted earnings per share was 0.24 and 0.11 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollar amounts in thousands) The Company has a mortgage note payable to Burke Herbert Bank Trust Company, formally Summit Community Bank (the Bank for the construction of the North Carolina facility. The note carries a ten-year term at a fixed interest rate of 3.64 annually per the Promissory Note Rate Conversion Agreement, with monthly payments of 22, and is secured by all of the assets of Smith-Carolina and a guarantee by the Company. The balance of the note payable at September 30, 2024 was 1,221. The balance of the note payable at December 31, 2023 was 1,382. The Company also has a note payable to the Bank in the amount of 1,624 as of September 30, 2024 and 1,792 as of December 31, 2023. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on the Midland, VA plant, building, and assets. The interest rate per the Promissory Note is fixed at 3.99 per annum, with principal and interest payments payable monthly over 120 months in the amount of 27. The loan matures on March 27, 2030. On February 10, 2022, the Company completed the financing for its acquisition of certain real property in Midland, VA from the fourth quarter of 2021, totaling approximately 29.8 acres, with a note payable to the Bank in the original principal amount of 2,805. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on the related real property. The interest rate is fixed at 4.09 per annum, with principal and interest payments payable monthly over 180 months for 21. The loan matures on February 10, 2037. The balance of the note payable on September 30, 2024 was 2,420. The balance of the note payable at December 31, 2023 was 2,525. The Company additionally has one smaller installment loan with an annual interest rate of 2.90 , maturing in 2025, with a balance of 16 as of September 30, 2024. The balance at December 31, 2023 was 29. Under the loan covenants with the Bank, the Company is limited to annual capital expenditures of 5,000 and has received a waiver for 2024 from the Bank. Also under the loan covenants with the Bank, the Company must maintain tangible net worth of 10,000. The Company is in compliance with all covenants pursuant to the loan agreements as of September 30, 2024. In addition to the notes payable discussed above, the Company has a 5,000 line of credit with the Bank with no balance outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The line of credit is evidenced by a commercial revolving promissory note, which carries a variable interest rate of prime, with a floor of 3.50 . The line of credit was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2024, but was extended to January 1, 2025. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on the Company's accounts receivable and inventory and a second lien position on all other business assets. Key provisions of the line of credit required the Company (i) to obtain bank approval for capital expenditures in excess of 5,000 during the term of the loan and (ii) to obtain bank approval prior to its funding of any acquisition. On October 1, 2023, the Company received a Commitment Letter from the Bank to provide a guidance line of credit specifically to purchase business equipment in an amount up to 1,500. The commitment provided for the purchase of equipment for which a note payable will be executed with a term not to exceed five years with an interest rate at the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus 0.50 with a floor of 3.50 per annum. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on all equipment purchased under the line. The commitment for the guidance line of credit matured on October 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not purchased any equipment pursuant to the 1,500 commitment. The Company's outstanding notes payable are financed at fixed rates of interest. This leaves the Company protected from fluctuating interest rates. Increases in such rates will only affect the interest paid by the Company if new debt is obtained, or the available line of credit is drawn upon, with a variable interest rate. On September 30, 2024, the Company had cash totaling 9,013 compared to cash totaling 9,175 on December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash is primarily the result of cash absorbed by investing activities through capital spending as described in further detail below. The Company expects its cash position to be favorably affected to the extent that it is successful in collecting outstanding accounts receivable balances. The Company s accounts receivable balances, net of allowance, at September 30, 2024 was 17,822, compared to 17,209 at December 31, 2023. Capital spending for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 5,543 as compared to 4,131 for the same period in 2023. The 2024 expenditures were primarily for a new batch plant system for the South Carolina manufacturing facility, utility vault forms for increased production capacity, and crash cushions to expand the Company s rental product offering. The Company intends to invest approximately 6,000 for the full year 2024, which includes expansion of the North Carolina manufacturing facility, soundwall forms for increased production capacity, and miscellaneous manufacturing equipment. Anticipated capital expenditures excludes possible acquisitions. 20 Table of Contents The Company s cash flow from operations is affected by production schedules set by contractors, which generally provide for payment 30 to 90 days after the products are produced, and with some architectural contracts, retainage may be held until the entire project is completed. This payment schedule may result in liquidity challenges for the Company because it must bear a portion of the cost of production before it receives payment from its customers. The Company s average days sales outstanding (DSO), excluding the effect of unbilled revenue, was 85 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 116 days for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. If actual results regarding the Company's production, sales, and subsequent collections on customer receivables are materially inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company may in the future encounter cash flow and liquidity issues. If the Company's operational performance deteriorates significantly, it may be unable to comply with existing financial covenants and could cause defaults and acceleration under its loan agreements and lose access to the credit facility. Although no assurances can be given, the Company believes that its current cash resources, anticipated cash flow from operations, and the availability under the line of credit will be sufficient to finance the Company s operations for at least the next 12 months. The Company s inventory was 6,242 on September 30, 2024, and 5,150 on December 31, 2023, or an increase of 1,092. The increase in inventory is mainly due to the increase of finished goods inventory compared to the prior year. The increase is related to inventory needed on-hand for the anticipated delivery schedules as it relates to utility vaults in 2024. Inventory turnover was 9.7, annualized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.3, annualized for the same period in 2023. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s critical accounting policies are more fully described in its Summary of Accounting Policies to the Company s consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Seasonality The Company services the construction industry primarily in areas of the United States where construction activity may be inhibited by adverse weather during the winter. As a result, the Company may experience reduced revenues from December through February and realize a more significant part of its revenues during the other months of the year. The Company may experience lower profits, or losses, during the winter months, and as such, must have sufficient working capital to fund its operations at a reduced level until the spring construction season. The failure to generate or obtain sufficient working capital during the winter may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Inflation Raw material costs used in production have slightly increased for the first nine months of 2024. The Company anticipates raw material prices to slightly increase for the remainder of 2024, although no assurance can be given regarding future pricing. Sales Backlog As of November 1, 2024, the Company s sales backlog was approximately 62.8 million, as compared to approximately 60.2 million at the same time in 2023. It is estimated that the majority of the projects in the sales backlog will be produced within 12 months, with a portion extending several years. 21 Table of Contents I TEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not Applicable I TEM 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, as a result of our material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting previously disclosed within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In this respect, management identified a material weakness in the methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses and a material weakness in the review and approval of journal entries. Notwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses, management believes that the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q present, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition as reported, in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The following previously reported material weaknesses, as previously reported within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, continue to exist at September 30, 2024. Allowance for Credit Losses As previously reported, the Company identified a material weakness related to the review of its allowances. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain the adequate management review controls related to the review over the determination of expected credit losses. Journal Entries The Company did not design and maintain effective processes and controls to ensure all journal entries are properly reviewed and approved prior to posting to the general ledger. Additionally, the Company did not maintain proper segregation of duties within its general ledger system as it relates to logical access to post and approve manual journal entries. Remediation Efforts Management is committed to the remediation of the material weaknesses described above. To address the material weakness associated with the review of the allowance for credit losses, management has designed and implemented enhanced control activities that includes detailed documentation of matters considered while preparing and reviewing the allowance for credit losses. While management believes they have effectively designed and implemented an enhanced review control, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the control operates for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the control is operating effectively. To address the material weakness associated with the review and posting of journal entries, management is actively exploring potential functionality available with the Company s general ledger system, as well as the need for monitoring controls to effectively mitigate the risk. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than as described above, there were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 22 Table of Contents P ART II OTHER INFORMATION I TEM 1.
