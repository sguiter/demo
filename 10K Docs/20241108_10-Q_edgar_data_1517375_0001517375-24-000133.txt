CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Quarterly Report not based on historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements include statements about Sprout Social, Inc. s Sprout Social plans, objectives, strategies, financial performance and outlook, trends, prospects or future events and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual financial results, performance, achievements or prospects may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as anticipate, believe, can, continue, could, estimate, expect, explore, intend, long-term model, may, might, outlook, plan, potential, predict, project, should, strategy, target, will, would, or the negative of these terms and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, as they relate to Sprout Social, our business and our management. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Sprout Social and our management based on their knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, are inherently uncertain. These forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and stockholders should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors include, among others, the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth under Part I Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors and the risks and uncertainties related to the following: 
 
 our ability to attract, retain, and grow customers; 
 our future financial performance, including our revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, ability to generate positive cash flow, and ability to achieve and maintain profitability; 
 our ability to access third-party APIs and data on favorable terms; 
 our ability to increase spending of existing customers; 
 the evolution of the social media industry, including technological advances and adapting to new regulations and use cases; 
 the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies into our products, which may lead to increased governmental or regulatory scrutiny; 
 our ability to innovate and provide a superior customer experience; 
 our ability to successfully enter new markets, manage our international expansion and comply with any applicable laws and regulations; 
 our ability to successfully adapt our sales, success, and compliance efforts to the demands of sophisticated enterprise customers; 
 our ability to maintain and enhance our brand; 
 our estimates of the size of our market opportunities; 
 the effects of increased competition from our market competitors or new entrants to the market; 
 our ability to securely maintain customer and other third-party data; 
 2 

our ability to comply with existing, modified or new laws and regulations applying to our business, including data privacy and security regulations; 
 our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property; 
 worldwide economic conditions, including the macroeconomic impacts of high levels of inflation, high interest rates and ongoing overseas conflict, and their impact on demand for our platform and products; 
 our ability to acquire, invest in, and integrate other businesses or technologies into our business or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions and technologies; 
 our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel; 
 our ability to manage our substantial debt in a way that does not adversely affect our business; and 
 the other factors set forth in our Annual Report filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on Form 10-K under Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 
 These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause our actual financial results, performance, achievements or prospects to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake or assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, laws or other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent required by applicable laws. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. 
 
 In addition, statements such as "we believe" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this report. While we believe such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other parts of this Quarterly Report. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." 
 Overview 
 Sprout Social is a powerful, centralized platform that provides the critical business layer to unlock the massive commercial value of social media. We have made it increasingly easy to standardize on Sprout Social as the centralized system of record for social and to help customers maximize the value of this mission critical channel. Currently, approximately 30,000 customers across more than 100 countries rely on our platform. 
 Introduced in 2011, our cloud software brings together social messaging, data and workflows in a unified system of record, intelligence and action. Operating across major networks, including X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google, Reddit, Glassdoor and YouTube, and commerce platforms Facebook Shops, Shopify and WooCommerce, we provide organizations with a centralized platform to manage their social media efforts across stakeholders and business functions. Virtually every aspect of business has been impacted by social media, from marketing, sales, commerce and public relations to customer service, product and strategy, creating a need for an entirely new category of software. We offer our customers a centralized, secure and powerful platform to manage this broad, complex channel effectively across their organization. 
 We generate revenue primarily from subscriptions to our social media management platform under a software-as-a-service model. Our subscriptions can range from monthly to one-year or multi-year arrangements and are generally non-cancellable during the contractual subscription term. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the date the product is made available to customers, which typically begins on the commencement date of each contract. We also generate revenue from professional services related to our platform provided to certain customers, which is recognized at the time these services are provided to the customer. This revenue has historically represented less than 1 of our revenue and is expected to be immaterial for the foreseeable future. 
 Our tiered subscription-based model allows our customers to choose among three core plans to meet their needs. Each plan is licensed on a per user per month basis at prices dependent on the level of features offered. Additional product modules, which offer increased functionality depending on a customer s needs, can be purchased by the customer on a per user per month basis. 
 We generated revenue of 102.6 million and 85.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing growth of 20 . We generated revenue of 298.8 million and 240.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing growth of 24 . In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, software subscriptions contributed 99 of our revenue. 
 We generated net losses of 17.1 million and 23.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of 23.2 million and 19.0 million, respectively. We generated net losses of 47.6 million and 46.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of 61.9 million and 49.0 million, respectively. We expect to continue investing in the growth of our business and, as a result, generate net losses for the foreseeable future.

Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions 
 
 As a company with a global footprint, we are subject to risks and exposures caused by significant events and their macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, high levels of inflation, high interest rates, ongoing overseas conflict, volatility in the capital markets and related market uncertainty. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts, and the potential for future impacts, of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. 
 Our current and prospective customers are impacted by these macroeconomic conditions to varying degrees. Potentially as a result of these various macroeconomic impacts on our current and prospective customers, we periodically have experienced more measured buying behavior by current and prospective customers and lengthening of the average sales cycle for certain types of customers and sales (including sales to prospective customers and expansion sales to current customers), which have contributed to a slowdown in our revenue growth as compared to historical levels. We believe macroeconomic uncertainty could persist, and as a result, we expect that some or all of these negative trends may emerge or recur during future quarters. 
 
 Acquisition of Tagger Media, Inc. 
 On August 2, 2023, we completed our acquisition of all the outstanding equity of Tagger Media, Inc. Tagger ), for a total purchase consideration of 144 million. We acquired Tagger in order to expand into the influencer marketing category. Tagger s platform enables marketers to discover influencers, plan and manage campaigns, analyze competitor strategies, report on trends and measure return on investment. We funded the purchase consideration with a combination of cash on hand and 75 million borrowed under the revolving credit facility further described in Note 5 - Revolving Line of Credit of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report). 
 
 The fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions. The allocation of fair value of purchase consideration was finalized in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 We have included the financial results of Tagger in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Refer to Note 11 - Business Combinations of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) for further discussion regarding the acquisition. 
 
 Acquisition of Repustate, Inc. 
 On January 19, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Repustate, Inc. for a total purchase consideration of 8.3 million, consisting of approximately 6.8 million in cash paid at the closing time of the acquisition and a holdback of 1.5 million in cash to be paid as purchase consideration after the one-year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition, assuming no claims by the Company against the holdback amount for post-closing purchase price adjustments or indemnification matters. The purchase price holdback was paid in full in January 2024. 
 The fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions. The allocation of fair value of purchase consideration was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 The Repustate acquisition has increased our power, breadth and automation of social listening, messaging, and customer care capabilities with added sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). We have included the financial results of Repustate in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The impact of Repustate s financial results following the date of acquisition were not significant to Sprout s condensed consolidated financial

statements. Refer to Note 11 - Business Combinations of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) for further discussion. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Acquiring new customers 
 We are focused on continuing to organically grow our customer base by increasing demand for our platform and penetrating our addressable market. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in expanding our sales force and marketing efforts to acquire new cust omers. Currently, we have approximately 30,000 customers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while our total number of customers have decreased, our n umber of customers contributing over 10,000 in ARR and 50,000 in ARR increased. In addition, as we continue to focus on expanding our enterprise customer base, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience longer and more expansive average sale cycles and increased pricing pressure, which may be exacerbated by the macroeconomic factors described above. We expect these trends to continue as we remain focused on our most sophisticated customers. 
 Expanding within our current customer base 
 We believe that there is a substantial and largely untapped opportunity for organic growth within our existing customer base. Customers often begin by purchasing a small number of user subscriptions and then expand over time, increasing the number of users or social profiles, as well as purchasing additional product modules. Customers may then expand use-cases between various departments to drive collaboration across their organizations. Our sales and customer success efforts include encouraging organizations to expand use-cases to more fully realize the value from the broader adoption of our platform throughout an organization. We will continue to invest in enhancing awareness of our brand, creating additional uses for our products and developing more products, features and functionality of existing products, which we believe are vital to achieving increased adoption of our platform. We have a history of attracting new customers and we have increased our focus on expanding their use of our platform over time. 
 Sustaining product and technology innovation 
 Our success is dependent on our ability to sustain product and technology innovation and maintain the competitive advantage of our proprietary technology. We continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform by introducing new products, features and functionality of existing products. 
 International expansion 
 We see international expansion as a meaningful opportunity to grow our platform. Revenue generated from non-U.S. customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 27 of our total revenue. We have teams in Ireland, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore, India, Australia, the Philippines and Poland to support our growth internationally. We believe global demand for our platform and offerings will continue to increase as awareness of our platform in international markets grows. We plan to continue adding to our local sales, customer support and customer success teams in select international markets over time. 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Consistent with our communications in previous quarters, we no longer believe that ARR and total number of customers are key performance indicators of Sprout Social s business due to our evolving customer mix and we will no longer publicly disclose these metrics. 
 28 

Number of customers contributing more than 10,000 in ARR 
 We define customers contributing more than 10,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than 10,000 in ARR as of a period end. 
 We view the number of customers that contribute more than 10,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base. Over time, larger customers have constituted a greater share of our revenue. 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Number of customers contributing more than 10,000 in ARR 
 9,119 8,111 
 Number of customers contributing more than 50,000 in ARR 
 We define customers contributing more than 50,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than 50,000 in ARR as of a period end. 
 We view the number of customers that contribute more than 50,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our largest customers and attract more sophisticated organizations. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base. Over time, our largest customers have constituted a greater share of our revenue. 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Number of customers contributing more than 50,000 in ARR 1,610 1,252 
 
 While we no longer believe that ARR and total number of customers are key performance indicators of Sprout Social s business, these metrics are necessary for an understanding of how we define number of customers contributing over 10,000 in ARR and number of customers contributing over 50,000 in ARR. For this purpose, we define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period and we define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain, or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement or entity. 
 Components of our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Subscription 
 We generate revenue primarily from subscriptions to our social media management platform under a software-as-a-service model. Our subscriptions can range from monthly to one-year or multi-year arrangements and are generally non-cancellable during the contractual subscription term. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the date our product is made available to customers, which typically begins on the commencement date of each contract. Our customers do not have the right to take possession of the online software solution. We also generate a small portion of our subscription revenue from third-party resellers. 
 29 

Professional Services 
 We sell professional services consisting of, but not limited to, implementation fees, specialized training, one-time reporting services and recurring periodic reporting services. Professional services revenue is recognized at the time these services are provided to the customer. This revenue has historically represented less than 1 of our revenue and is expected to be immaterial for the foreseeable future. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Subscription 
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our platform and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of fees paid to data providers, hosted data center costs and personnel costs directly associated with cloud infrastructure, customer success and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and allocated overhead. These costs also include depreciation expense and amortization expense related to acquired developed technologies that directly benefit sales. Overhead associated with facilities and information technology is allocated to cost of revenue and operating expenses based on headcount. Although we expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our business and revenue grows, we expect our cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time. 
 Professional Services and Other 
 Cost of professional services primarily consists of expenses related to our professional services organization and are comprised of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and allocated overhead. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross margin is calculated as gross profit as a percentage of total revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on revenue earned, the timing and amount of investments made to expand our hosting capacity, our customer support and professional services teams and in hiring additional personnel, and the impact of acquisitions. We expect our gross profit and gross margin to increase as our business grows over time. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include depreciation expense and other expenses associated with product development. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in research and development for the foreseeable future as we focus on developing new features and enhancements to our plan offerings. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs directly associated with our sales and marketing department, online advertising expenses, as well as allocated overhead, including depreciation expense. Sales commissions and bonuses are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions are earned and recorded at contract commencement for both new customer contracts and expansion of contracts with existing customers. Sales commissions are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be five years. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in sales and marketing for the foreseeable future, primarily for increased headcount for our sales department. 
 30 

General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel expenses associated with our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. Our general and administrative expenses also include professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and amortization expense, as well as allocated overhead. We expect to increase the size of our general and administrative functions to support the growth of our business. We expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. However, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time. 
 Interest Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense related to the Facility and is offset by interest income earned on our cash and investment balances. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 The income tax provision consists of current and deferred taxes for our United States and foreign jurisdictions. We have historically reported a taxable loss in our most significant jurisdiction, the United States, and have a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.

The increase in general and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the following: 
 Change in thousands 
 Personnel costs 5,889 Stock-based compensation expense 4,033 Amortization of intangible assets 1,095 Acquisition-related costs (4,221) Other (967) General and administrative 5,829 
 Personnel costs and stock-based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of a 3 increase in headcount as we continue to grow our business. The increase in the amortization expense of intangible assets was primarily driven by the intangible assets recognized as part of the Tagger acquisition. The decrease in acquisition-related costs was driven by costs associated with the Tagger acquisition in August 2023.

 Interest income (expense), net 226 4,601 (4,375) (95) Percentage of total revenue 2 
 
 The decrease in interest income, net was primarily driven by higher interest expense from the Facility and lower interest income attributable to a lower balance of marketable securities.

 Income tax expense (benefit) 328 (753) 1,081 (144) Percentage of total revenue 
 The change in income tax expense (benefit) was primarily driven by the income tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2023 due to a release of the Company s valuation allowance resulting from deferred tax liabilities established for finite-lived intangible assets from the acquisition of Tagger. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the below non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, operating results or future outlook. 
 However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 Non-GAAP Gross Profit 
 We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from the Tagger acquisition. We believe non-GAAP gross profit provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP gross 
 43 

profit to exclude amortization expense associated with the acquired developed technology from the Tagger acquisition.

 Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) 
 We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition. We believe non-GAAP operating income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization expense, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP operating income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition.

Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) 
 We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits recognized from changes in the valuation allowance associated with our acquisition of Tagger.

 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share 
 We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as GAAP net loss per share attributable to common shareholders, basic and diluted, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, amortization expense and tax benefits due to changes in valuation allowances from business acquisitions, which are often unrelated to overall operating performance. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to exclude acquisition-related expenses in connection with the Tagger acquisition, amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets from the Tagger acquisition and tax benefits recognized from changes in the valuation allowance associated with our acquisition of Tagger.

 Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow 
 We define non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs and interest. Non-GAAP free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual obligations or represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. We believe that non-GAAP free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in our core operations that, after the expenditures for property and equipment, acquisition-related costs and interest, is available to be used for strategic initiatives. For example, if non-GAAP free cash flow is negative, we may need to access cash reserves or other sources of capital to invest in strategic initiatives. In 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP free cash flow to exclude payments related to acquisition-related costs associated with our acquisition of Tagger and cash paid for interest on our revolving line of credit.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of 82.9 million, marketable securities of 8.6 million and net accounts receivable of 54.4 million. Historically, we have generated losses from operations as evidenced by our accumulated deficit and in previous years, we had negative cash flows from operations. However, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated positive cash flows from operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow the business. We may experience greater than anticipated operating losses in the short- and long-term due to macroeconomic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control, such as high inflation rates and a potential recession. The impact of these factors on our customers and our operations going forward remains uncertain, and we continue to proactively monitor our liquidity position. 
 Prior to our IPO in December 2019, we financed our operations primarily through private issuance of equity securities and line of credit borrowings. In our IPO, we received net proceeds of 134.3 million 
 46 

after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 10.5 million and offering expenses of 5.2 million. We subsequently received an additional 10.0 million of net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions in January 2020 as a result of the over-allotment option exercise by the underwriters of our IPO. In August 2020, we received 42.1 million of net proceeds from our equity follow-on offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. As described below, in August 2023, we borrowed 75 million under the Facility in connection with the Tagge r acquisition. Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been to fund operations, pay for acquisitions, invest in marketable securities, pay down our Facility, and invest in capital expenditures. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash and investment balances and potential future equity or debt transactions. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our subscription growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our customers and our operations, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our product. We have in the past, and may in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Credit Agreement 
 On August 1, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the banks and other financial institutions or entities party thereto as lenders and MUFG Bank, LTD. as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a 100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Facility ), maturing on August 1, 2028. Borrowings under the Facility may be used to finance acquisitions and other investments permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement, to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. 
 Borrowings under the Facility may be designated as SOFR Loans or ABR Loans (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), subject to certain terms and conditions under the Credit Agreement, and bear interest at a rate of either (i) SOFR (subject to a 1.0 floor), plus 0.10 , plus a margin ranging from 2.75 to 3.25 based on the Company s liquidity or (ii) ABR (subject to a 2.0 floor) plus a margin ranging from 1.75 to 2.25 based on the Company s liquidity. The Facility also includes a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Facility of 0.30 or 0.35 based on the Company s liquidity. 
 The Credit Agreement includes customary conditions to credit extensions, affirmative and negative covenants, and customary events of default. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants as to (i) minimum liquidity, requiring the maintenance, at all times and measured at the end of each fiscal quarter, of cash and cash equivalents of not less than the greater of (x) 30 million and (y) 30 of the total revolving commitments, and (ii) minimum recurring revenue growth, requiring recurring revenue growth for the trailing four fiscal quarter period, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter, of not less than 115 of the actual recurring revenue for the same period in the prior fiscal year. 
 
 On August 1, 2023, we borrowed 75 million under the Credit Agreement in connection with the Tagger acquisition. As of September 30, 2024, 30 million remains outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 11 - Business Combinations of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) for further discussion. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 47 

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 22,179 9,060 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 36,714 (118,806) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (25,733) 73,790 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 33,160 (35,956) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscription services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel costs across the sales and marketing and research and development departments and hosting costs. In previous years, we have generated negative cash flows from operating activities. However, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated positive cash flows from operating activities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.2 million, which resulted from a net loss of 47.6 million adjusted for non-cash charges of 83.6 million and net cash outflow of 13.9 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of 61.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, 11.6 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, which were primarily commissions, 7.5 million of depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense and 1.4 million of amortization of right-of-use, or ROU, operating lease assets. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a 21.1 million increase in deferred commissions due to the addition of new customers and expansion of the business, a 4.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a 2.9 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a 1.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. These outflows were primarily offset by a 8.8 million increase in deferred revenue and a 7.7 million decrease in accounts receivable. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 9.1 million, which resulted from a net loss of 46.4 million adjusted for non-cash charges of 71.2 million and net cash outflow of 15.8 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of 49.0 million of stock-based compensation expense, 19.1 million for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, which were primarily commissions, 1.1 million of amortization of right-of-use, or ROU, operating lease assets, and 4.2 million of depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a 26.0 million increase in deferred commissions due to the addition of new customers and expansion of the business, a 3.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a 2.6 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, and a 7.7 million increase in accounts receivable. These outflows were primarily offset by a 23.9 million increase in deferred revenue. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.7 million, which was primarily due to 40.2 million in proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities and 0 .1 million consideration received related to a purchase price adjustment from the Tagger acquisition, partially offset by 2.1 million in purchases of computer equipment and hardware and the 1.5 million payout of the Repustate acquisition purchase price holdback. 
 48 

Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 118.8 million, which was primarily due to 145.8 million paid for the acquisitions of Tagger and Repustate and 63.1 million in purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by 91.5 million in proceeds from the maturities and sale of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.7 million, primarily driven by 25.0 million in repayments of the Facility and 2.0 million in payments related to employee withholding taxes as a result of the net settlement of stock-based awards, partially offset by 1.2 million in proceeds from purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 73.8 million, primarily driven by 75.0 million in borrowings under the Facility and 1.4 million in proceeds from purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by 1.8 million in payments related to employee withholding taxes as a result of the net settlement of stock-based awards and 0.8 million in issuance costs related to the Facility. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have non-cancellable contractual obligations related primarily to operating leases and minimum guaranteed purchase commitments for data and services. As of September 30, 2024, the total obligation for operating leases was 18.9 million, of which 4.4 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, our purchase commitment for primarily data and services was 12.3 million, of which 7.7 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. See Note 3 - Operating Leases and Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) for more information regarding these obligations. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to section titled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) for more information. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. There have been no significant changes to these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , except as noted in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report). 
 49 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We had cash and cash equivalents totaling 82.9 million as of September 30, 2024, the majority of which was invested in money market accounts and money market funds. We also had marketable securities of 8.6 million which were invested in investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. agency securities. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk with respect to the interest income generated. Additionally, certain of these cash investments are maintained at balances beyond Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, coverage limits or are not insured by the FDIC. Accordingly, there may be a risk that we will not recover the full principal of our cash investments. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant. Because these accounts are highly liquid, we do not have material exposure to market risk. Our cash is held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 30 million in secured indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The revolving line of credit bears interest at a rate of either (i) SOFR (subject to a 1.0 floor), plus 0.10 , plus a margin ranging from 2.75 to 3.25 based on the Company s liquidity or (ii) ABR (subject to a 2.0 floor) plus a margin ranging from 1.75 to 2.25 based on the Company s liquidity. Refer to Note 5 - Revolving Line of Credit of the Notes to the Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report). 
 We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We are not currently subject to significant foreign currency exchange risk as our U.S. and international sales are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have some foreign currency risk related to a small amount of sales denominated in Canadian dollars. Sales denominated in Canadian dollars reflect the prevailing U.S. dollar exchange rate on the date of invoice for such sales. Decreases in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar may negatively affect revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. We do not believe that an immediate 10 increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollars would have a material effect on operating results. 
 We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date. However, as our international operations expand, our foreign currency exchange risk may increase. If our foreign currency exchange risk increases in the future, we may evaluate the costs and benefits of initiating a foreign currency hedge program in connection with non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions. 
 50 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in internal controls 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company will have been detected.

The amount of shares to be sold to satisfy the Company s tax withholding obligations under these arrangements is dependent on future events which cannot be known at this time, including the future trading price of the Company s Class A common stock. The expiration date relating to these arrangements is dependent on future events which cannot be known at this time, including the final vest date of the applicable restricted stock units and the officer s termination of service.
