 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about MSD Investment Corp. (together, with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company , we , us or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; 

an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies that we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; 

an economic downturn could also impact availability and pricing of our financing and our ability to access the debt capital markets; 

a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; 

interest rate volatility and a high interest rate environment could adversely affect our results, particularly if we elect to use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 

currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; 

our limited operating history as a business development company BDC 

our future operating results; 

the impact of rising interest and inflation rates and the risk of recession on our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

competition with other entities and our affiliates for investment opportunities; 

the loss of key personnel; 

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 

the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our portfolio companies; 

our use of financial leverage; 

risks related to the uncertainty of the value of our portfolio investments; 

the impact of geopolitical conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war, including those arising out of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, ongoing conflict in the Middle East, and general uncertainty surrounding the financial and political stability of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China, and other countries; 

the impact that environmental, social, and governance matters could have on our brand and reputation and our portfolio companies; 

the ability of MSD Partners, L.P. (the Adviser to source suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our ability to qualify for and maintain our qualification, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and our ability to operate as a BDC; 

the effect of legal, tax and regulatory changes on our business and our portfolio companies; and 

other risks, uncertainties and other factors previously identified in the reports and other documents we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this report because we are an investment company. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024, which is accessible on the SEC s website at sec.gov.

The Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. ASC 740 requires the Company to evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company s tax returns are subject to tax examination by major taxing authorities for a period of three years from when they are filed. The Company is additionally not awa re of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next twelve months. As a result, income tax liability or expense has been recorded on the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense on the consolidated statement of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company did t incur any interest or penalties. Prior to the Corporate Conversion, the Company was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and incurred no U.S. federal, state, city, or foreign income tax liability on income earned during that period. Instead, each partner reported his or her share of the Company's income, capital gain/(loss) and credit on his or her own tax return. Consequently, no provision for income taxes had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

The Management Fee will be appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable period. If an Exchange Listing occurs on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the management fee will be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after the Exchange Listing based on the number of days in such calendar quarter before and after the Exchange Listing.

For derivatives traded under an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement ISDA Master Agreement ), the collateral requirements are typically calculated by netting the mark-to-market amount for each transaction under such agreement and comparing that amount to the value of any collateral currently pledged by the Company or the counterparty. Cash collateral that has been pledged, if any, to cover obligations of the Company and cash collateral received from the counterparty, if any, is reported on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as collateral deposits (received) for foreign currency forward contracts. Generally, the amount of collateral due from or to a party has to exceed a minimum transfer amount threshold before a transfer is required. To the extent amounts due to the Company from a counterparty are not fully collateralized, the Company bears the risk of loss from counterparty non-performance.

The Company generally employs the Income Based Approach (as described below) to estimate the fair value of the investment. Additionally, the Company may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company or any applicable collateral, in order to evaluate coverage of the Company s debt investment. Income Based Approach: The Company may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment, specifically the yield method. Projected cash flows represent the relevant investment s contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment s expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate that is calibrated to the initial transaction and monitored over time to adjust for changes in observed market spreads and yields since the issuance of the investment as well as changes in company specific factors. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. Market Based Approach: The Company may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing cash flow (typically EBITDA or revenue, or the relevant industry metric) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. The Company considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value its portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, and relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The Company may apply an average of various relevant comparable company multiples to the portfolio company s latest twelve month EBITDA, revenue or other applicable metric to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. The Company may also consider projected multiples in the assessment if applicable.

 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt investments is the market interest rate. Typically, the Company uses the market interest rate for loans to determine if the effective yield on a loan is commensurate with the market yields for that type of loan. If a loan s effective yield was significantly less than the market yield for a similar loan with a similar credit profile, then the resulting fair value of the loan may have been lower.

(1) The Company generally uses prices provided by an independent pricing service, or directly from an independent broker, which are indicative prices on or near the valuation date as the primary basis for the fair valuation determinations for quoted senior secured bonds and loans. Since these prices are non-binding, they may not be indicative of fair value. Each quoted price is evaluated by the Adviser in conjunction with additional information compiled by it, including financial performance, recent business developments and various other factors. Investments with fair values determined in this manner were not included in the table above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had investments of this nature measured at fair value totaling million and , respectively.

For Calendar Year 2023 

Dividend Reinvestment The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan DRP ), pursuant to which it reinvests all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of its Shareholders who elected not to receive their dividends in cash. Shareholders who have opted into the Company s DRP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional Shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. A participating Shareholder will receive an amount of Shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant s shares divided by the most recent net asset value NAV per share that is available on the date such distribution was paid. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of Shares will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, those Shareholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. The Company intends to use newly issued Shares to implement the DRP. Shares issued under the DRP will not reduce outstanding Capital Commitments.

 Overview 
 We were established as a Delaware limited liability company on February 18, 2021, and converted to MSD Investment, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, on October 22, 2021. On December 1, 2021, the Company entered into purchase agreements with three affiliated entities (MSD Credit Opportunities Fund, L.P., MSD Credit Opportunities Master Fund, L.P., and SOF Investments II, L.P. (collectively, the Funds )) pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire the initial portfolio of investments (the Initial Portfolio for an aggregate cash purchase price equal to the fair value of such assets, plus accrued but unpaid interest as of the closing date, less any principal payments received between signing of the purchase agreements and the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby. The closing of the purchase of the Initial Portfolio by the Company occurred on December 21, 2021. As consideration for the Initial Portfolio, the Company paid an aggregate purchase price of 656.5 million. On December 28, 2021, the Company filed Articles of Conversion (and related Articles of Incorporation) with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation in order to convert to a Maryland corporation (the Corporate Conversion ). In accordance with the Articles of Conversion and Maryland law, the Corporate Conversion became effective as of 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 2022 and, as result of the Corporate Conversion, each share representing a portion of the membership interests of the Company prior to the effective time of the Corporate Conversion was automatically converted into one share of common stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Shares ), of the Company. In connection with the Corporate Conversion the Company changed its name from MSD Investment, LLC to MSD Investment Corp. On December 29, 2021, the Company filed a Form N-54A to elect to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). 
 We have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). As a BDC and a RIC, we will be required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. 
 The Company s investment objective is to invest in a broad range of portfolio companies, primarily through senior secured loans and notes where we believe the probability of losses are limited and the opportunity to generate attractive risk adjusted returns is maximized. The Adviser expects to execute this strategy by continuing its long history of leveraging its network to source and diligence what it believes to be attractive opportunities across a broad range of industries. The strategy will be executed by a team of experienced investment professionals who have more than a 20-year history of successfully deploying capital in both liquid and illiquid investments.

We utilize an investment rating system to monitor the credit profile of our underlying portfolio companies. We use a five-level ratings scale to classify individual investments. 
 Investment Rating 1 - Investment is performing materially above expectations. 

Investment Rating 2 - Investment is performing above expectations. 

Investment Rating 3 - Investment is performing materially in-line with expectations. All new loans received a rating of 3 at initial investment. 

Investment Rating 4 - Investment is performing materially below expectations. Investments with a rating of 4 receive more frequent attention from our team as the risks of impairment have increased substantially since investment. Loss of principal is not expected, however there may be lost interest.

 Investment Rating 5 - Investment is performing materially below expectations and there is a high probability of impairment. Loss of principal and interest is probable.

Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt securities of portfolio companies that we acquire and hold for investment purposes. Our investments in debt securities generally have expected maturities of two to eight years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity, and typically earn interest at floating and fixed interest rates. Interest on our debt securities is generally payable to us monthly, quarterly or semi-annually. The outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the respective maturity dates. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of dividends from preferred and common equity investments, amortization of original issue discount, prepayment fees, commitment fees, origination fees and fees for providing significant managerial assistance. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include a management fee and, depending on our operating results, a performance-based incentive fee, interest expense, administrative services, custodian and accounting services and other third-party professional services fees and expenses. The management and performance-based incentive fees compensate the Adviser for its services in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments.

 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses can be categorized into fixed operating expenses, variable operating expenses and performance-dependent expenses. Fixed operating expenses are generally static period over period. Variable expenses are calculated based on fund metrics such as total assets, net assets or total borrowings. Performance-dependent expenses fluctuate independent of our size.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net realized gains (losses) were 4.6 million and 0.1) million, respectively, and our net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) were 7.5 million and 32.8 million, respectively. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The Company's comprehensive accounting policies are described more fully in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We have identified Basis of Presentation , Valuation of Investments , and Revenue Recognition within Note 2 as critical accounting policies. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments and Net Asset Value of Shares 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Company's board of directors (the Board has designated the Adviser as the Company's valuation designee (the Valuation Designee to determine the fair value of the Company's investments that do not have readily available market quotations, which became effective for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Pursuant to the Company s valuation policy approved by the Board, the Valuation Designee will determine the fair value of the Company s assets on at least a quarterly basis, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement . The audit committee of the Board (the Audit Committee is comprised of directors who are not interested persons, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of the Company or the Adviser (each an Independent Director ). 
 Under procedures established by the Board, the Company intends to value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. Assets listed on an exchange will be valued at their last sales prices as reported to the consolidated quotation service at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date of determination. If no such sales of such securities occurred, such securities will be valued at the bid price as reported by an independent, third-party pricing service on the date of determination. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available will be valued 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 at fair value. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. The Company will also engage independent valuation providers to assist in the valuation of each investment that constitutes a material portion of the Company s portfolio and that does not have a readily available market quotation at least once annually. With respect to unquoted securities, the Valuation Designee, with the input of independent valuation advisers and the Audit Committee, will determine fair value. Elements that could be used to determine the fair value of an investment include, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors. The types of factors that may be considered in determining the fair values of investments include, but are not limited to, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings. The Company may appoint additional or different independent valuation firms in the future. 
 When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs with respect to a fair-valued portfolio company or comparable company, the Valuation Designee will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist the Company in the valuation of such portfolio company. Because the Company expects that there will not be readily available market quotations for many of the investments in its portfolio, the Company expects to value many of its investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, subject to the continued oversight of the Board. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market quotation, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had readily available market quotations existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 On a quarterly basis, with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Adviser will undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 Securities for which no such market prices are readily available or reliable will be reviewed as part of the valuation process and preliminarily fair valued based on our estimate, or an independent third party's estimate, of the fair value as of the date of determination, and provided to the Adviser's valuation committee; 

Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser's valuation committee; 

Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee and the Board; 

At least once annually, the valuation for each investment that constitutes a material portion of the Company's portfolio and that does not have readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm; and 

The Valuation Designee will provide the Board with the information relating to the fair value determination pursuant to the Company s valuation policy in connection with each quarterly Board meeting, will comply with the periodic board reporting requirements set forth in the Company s valuation policy, and will provide the Board with its determination of the fair value of each investment in good faith. 

All values assigned to securities and other assets by the Valuation Designee will be binding on all Company investors. When pricing of the Company s Shares is necessary outside of the normal quarterly process, the Adviser will, among other things, review whether, to its knowledge, significant events have occurred since the last quarterly valuation which might affect the fair value of any of the Company s portfolio securities. 
 The ranges of unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our investments classified as Level 3 fair valued as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are presented in Note 6. Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 In addition to impacting the fair value recorded for our investments on our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, had we used different key unobservable inputs to determine the fair value of our investments, amounts recorded in our consolidated statement of operations, including the net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments, management and performance-based incentive fees would also be impacted. The table below outlines the impact on our results of a 5 increase in the fair value of our Level 3 investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Determination of Net Asset Value 
 The Valuation Designee will determine the net asset value NAV of the Shares at least quarterly. The NAV per share is equal to the value of the Company s total assets minus its liabilities and the liquidation value of any preferred shares outstanding divided by the total number of shares outstanding. Additionally, in connection with each offering of shares, to the extent the Company does not have Shareholder approval to sell below NAV, the Valuation

Table of Contents 

 Designee or an authorized committee thereof will be required to make a good faith determination that the Company is not selling shares at a price below the then current NAV of the shares at the time at which the sale is made. 
 The value of investments for which recent market quotations are readily available will be the market price. The Valuation Designee will be responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available in good faith, and in such other instances where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Because the Company expects that there typically will not be a readily available market quotation for its target portfolio investments, the Company expects that the value of most of its portfolio investments will be their fair value as determined by the Valuation Designee consistent with a documented valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. In making these determinations, the Valuation Designee will receive input from an independent valuation firm and the Audit Committee. 
 Hedging 
 The Company may enter into currency hedging contracts, interest rate hedging agreements such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts, and credit hedging contracts, such as credit default swaps. As of September 30, 2024 the Company had entered into foreign currency forward contracts in order to hedge its economic exposure to certain foreign currencies in which its investments were denominated Note.5 Derivative Instruments ). However, no assurance can be given that such hedging transactions will be effective. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents may include: (i) the sale of our Shares, (ii) borrowings under various financing arrangements, (iii) cash flows from interest, dividends and transaction fees earned from investment in portfolio companies and (iv) principal repayments and sale proceeds from our investments. 
 Our primary uses of cash will be for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including fees payable to MSD in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator), (iii) debt service of any borrowings, and (iv) cash distributions to our Shareholders.

Capital Resources 
 We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities and borrowing arrangements to increase the amount of our borrowings as our called equity capital increases. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty what terms any such financing would have or the costs we would incur in connection with any such financing arrangements. We are currently required to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio (total assets-to-senior securities) of 150 under the 1940 Act if certain conditions are met.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and therefore, we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as Valuation Designee based on, among other things, the input of our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Valuation Designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We will be subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 97.0 of our debt investments (95.5 of our total investments), or 3.84 billion measured at fair value, are subject to floating interest rates. Additionally, all of our Credit Facilities are also subject to floating interest rates. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to (i) higher interest income from our floating rate debt investments, (ii) value declines for fixed interest rate investments we may hold and (iii) higher interest expense in connection with our credit facilities. Since the majority of our investments consist of floating rating investments, an increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult for borrowers to repay their loans, and a rise in interest rates may also make it easier for the Adviser to meet or exceed the quarterly threshold for Income-Based Fee as described in Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions . 
 Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates. Although the Federal Reserve left its benchmark rates steady in the second quarter of 2024, it subsequently cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024 following improved inflation data. While the Federal Reserve indicated that there may be additional rate cuts in 2024, future reductions to benchmark rates in the future are not certain. In a rising interest rate environment, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could propel the United States into a recession, which would likely decrease interest rates. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in base rates, such as SOFR and other alternate rates, are not offset by corresponding increases in the spread over such base rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses, or a decrease in the interest rate associated with our borrowings. Furthermore, in a lower interest rate environment, we could face a situation where our outstanding debt obligations carry higher coupon payments than newly issued debt, resulting in an increase in relative borrowing costs unless we are able to refinance at more favorable terms. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income and expenses, should interest rates increase by 100, 200 or 300 basis points, or decrease by 100 or 200 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of the Financing Facilities, using the outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024. The base interest rate case assumes the rates on our portfolio investments remain unchanged from the actual effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.

Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We have employed and may continue to employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. We also have the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies under our credit facilities. Instead of entering into a foreign currency forward contract in connection with loans or other investments we have made that are denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan or investment. To the extent the loan or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our credit facilities, we may seek to utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Neither we nor the Adviser are currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings threatened against us or them. From time to time, we and/or the Adviser may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of these legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024 (See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors ), which is accessible on the SEC s website at sec.gov. These factors could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors discussed in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Except as previously reported by us on our Current Reports on Form 8-K, we did not sell any securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 5. Other Information. 
 (a) None 

(b) None. 

(c) For the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, no director or officer of the Company has entered into any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of securities of the Company intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of under the Exchange Act or (ii) any trading arrangement.
