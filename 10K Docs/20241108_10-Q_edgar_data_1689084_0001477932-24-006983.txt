Forward-looking statements represent our management s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this Report. You should read this Report with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they are made, except as required by federal securities and any other applicable law. The management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed unaudited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the notes to the unaudited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report and the Company s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC in its Annual Report on Form 10-K on April 15, 2024, along with the accompanying notes. As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms we, us, our and the Company means Qrons Inc. The Company has relied primarily on its two co-founders, Jonah Meer, Chief Executive Officer, and Ido Merfeld, President, who are its sole directors to manage its day-to-day business and has outsourced professional services to third parties in an effort to maintain lower operational costs. Messrs. Meer and Merfeld, as the holders of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of the Company s Class A Preferred Stock, collectively have 66 2/3 of the voting rights of the Company. Acting together, they will be able to influence the outcome of all corporate actions requiring the approval of our stockholders. Plan of Operations We are an innovative biotechnology company dedicated to developing products, treatments and technologies that create a platform to combat neuronal and infectious diseases. The Company s approach is to marshal and leverage its proprietary research with developing unique know how and intellectual properties by seeking to engage in strategic arrangements with companies and institutions that are developing technologies in the fields of, molecular biology, stem cells, drug development and tissue engineering, for deployment in the fight against neuronal and infectious diseases, and such other indications that may make use of our technology. The Company s search is focused on researchers based in Israel, a country which is world-renowned for biotech innovations and where our researchers are based. To date, the Company has collaborated with universities and scientists in the fields of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering and 3D printable hydrogels to develop a treatment that integrates proprietary, engineer mesenchymal stem cells MSCs ), 3D printable implant, smart materials and a novel delivery system and has two product candidates for treating penetrating and non-penetrating (concussion-like) traumatic brain injuries, both integrating proprietary, anti-brain inflammation synthetic hydrogel and modified MSCs. 26 Table of Contents In early 2022, the Company began collaborating with scientists at a leading University in Israel to conduct preliminary experiments to confirm that a combination of certain molecule compounds that they invented which contain immunomodulating properties when integrated with ingredients in our QS200 product candidate may substantially improve its solubility and allow very high dosage treatments which we believe offers treatment options to diffused axonal injuries. These molecules are being tested for certain indication in various Phase II trials conducted by others. We also believe that the improved dosage delivery may present a unique treatment option to patients who suffer from antibiotic resistant bacteria infection and Sepsis. We are looking to conduct such in vitro tests, which if successful we believe may provide an expedited pathway to human trials. On July 17, 2023 the Company entered into a License Agreement Term sheet with Professors Benjamin Sredni and Michael Albeck (the Professors ), to which Dr. Ido Merfeld, the Company s President, was a party. Under the Agreement the Professors, inventors of certain patents, applications, processes and who possess certain related know-how particularly as to AS101 Tellurium based compounds (the Background IP ), agreed to license the Background IP to the Company. Dr. Merfeld is the inventor of certain patents and possesses certain related know-how particularly as to Pseudopolyrotaxanes and Cyclodextrins, all owned by the Company Qrons IP ). The Professors granted Qrons an exclusive world-wide, perpetual license to the Background IP, unless the Background IP is returned should Qrons fail to meet certain fundraising and prosecution milestones. The Background IP, independently or together with the Qrons IP will be used as part of a new research program allowing for the use of all Background IP by Qrons to experiment and commercialize the therapeutic effect of certain Tellurium based compounds on antibiotic resistance bacterial infections, Sepsis and Traumatic brain injuries Tellurium Research ). The Tellurium Research will be allowed to expand to include other indications as progress warrants and agreed by the parties. The Professors and Merfeld as co-inventors will enter into a new patent filing for treating sepsis with certain Tellurium based compounds independently and in combination with Cyclodextrins, to be known as the New Patent . The New Patent will be assigned to Qrons, subject to Qrons rights under the Agreement. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Revenue We have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. 27 Table of Contents Net Loss We reported a net loss of 63,298 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 529,667 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as follows: Three Months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net sales - - Operating expenses: Research and development expenses 24,448 378,678 Professional fees 15,397 9,647 General and administrative expenses 18,322 51,230 Total operating expenses 58,167 439,555 Income (loss) from operations (58,167 (439,555 Other income (expense) Loss on extinguishment of debt - - Interest expense (7,519 (14,201 Change in fair market value of derivative liabilities 2,388 (75,911 Total other income (expense) (5,131 (90,112 Net income (loss) (63,298 (529,667 Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 58,167 compared to total operating expenses of 439,555 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The substantial decrease in operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses period over period mainly as a result of a reduction in the expense recorded related to amortization of stock-based compensation in the form of option grants during the three months ended September 30, 2024 of only 28,798, compared to 378,678 in the prior comparative three months ended September 30, 2023. Total research and development expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were further reduced by a credit from a vendor on previously invoiced expenses of 4,350, reducing overall research and development expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 24,448. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, professional fees increased slightly to 15,397 from 9,647 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly related to an increase in accounting fees to 12,345 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4,450 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, offset by a slight decrease in legal fees and other professional fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company also recorded a decrease to general and administrative expenses in the comparative three-month periods from 51,230 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 18,322 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to a reduction in the amortization of expense related to stock options granted to consultants from 31,818 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to only 2,111 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other Income (Expense) Other expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 5,131 included interest expense of 7,519 related to accrued interest on convertible notes payable, offset by a gain of 2,388 as a result of the change in fair market value of derivative liabilities. Other expense in the three months ended September 30, 2023, was 90,112, which included a loss of 75,911 as a result of the change in fair market value of derivative liabilities, and interest expense of 14,201 which is comprised of accretion of convertible notes of 7,016, and accrued interest on convertible notes payable of 7,185. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Revenue We have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. 28 Table of Contents Net Loss We had a net loss of 215,180 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 610,871 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as follows: September 30, 2024 2023 Net sales - - Operating expenses: Research and development expenses 138,736 375,792 Professional fees 42,078 50,867 General and administrative expenses 42,980 73,256 Total operating expenses 223,794 499,915 Income (loss) from operations (223,794 (499,915 Other income (expense) Loss on extinguishment of debt (29,780 (33,932 Interest expense (35,767 (91,079 Change in fair market value of derivative liabilities 74,161 14,055 Total other income (expense) 8,614 (110,956 Net (loss) (215,180 (610,871 Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 223,794 compared to total operating expenses of 499,915 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The substantial decrease in operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses period over period mainly due to a reduction in the expense recorded related to amortization of stock-based compensation in the form of option grants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 142,396 from stock based compensation in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 valued at 378,678.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a decrease in general and administrative expenses from 73,256 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 42,980 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to a reduction in amortization expense recorded with respect to stock options granted to consultants from 41,113 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to only 11,406 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other Income (Expense) Other income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 8,614 and included a loss on extinguishment of certain debt of 29,780 and interest expense of 35,767, which is comprised of accretion of convertible notes of 14,024 and accrued interest on convertible notes of 21,743, offset by a gain of 74,161 as a result of the change in fair market value of derivative liabilities. 29 Table of Contents Other expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 110,956, which included interest expense of 91,079 which is comprised of accretion of convertible notes of 27,789, interest penalties on certain convertible notes of 38,000 and accrued interest on convertible notes payable of 25,290 and a loss on extinguishment of certain debt of 33,932, offset by a gain of 14,055 as a result of the change in fair market value of derivative liabilities.

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of net loss of 610,871, offset by non-cash items, including accretion of debt discount of 27,789, noncash interest penalties of 38,000, a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 33,932, and a gain as a result of the change in valuation of derivative liabilities of 14,055, as well as changes to operating assets and liabilities, including an increase to accounts payable of 18,529 and an increase to accounts payable-related parties of 38,462. Investing Activities There were no investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 61,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 61,000 in proceeds from a related party in the form of unsecured advances. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received net proceeds of 52,500 from a related party in the form of unsecured advances. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 2,138. We are in the early stage of development and have experienced net losses to date and have not generated revenue from operations, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There are a number of conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to commercialize potential products and generate revenue, including successful development of product candidates, which includes clinical trials, FDA approval, demonstration of effectiveness sufficient to generate commercial orders by customers, establishing production capabilities as well as effective marketing and sales capabilities for our product. We do not currently have sufficient resources to accomplish any of these conditions necessary for us to generate revenue and expect to incur increasing operating expenses. We will require substantial additional funds for operations, the service of debt and to fund our business objectives. There can be no assurance that financing, whether debt or equity, will be available to us in the amount required at any particular time or for any particular period or, if available, that it can be obtained on terms favorable to us. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities, such as through the issuance and exercise of warrants, then existing stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt or other equity instruments, we may be subject to certain limitations in our operations, and the issuance of such securities may have rights senior to those of the then existing stockholders. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person or entity to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. We continue exploring sources of debt and equity financing as well as available grants. We are currently exploring and are in discussions for a potential strategic alliance in the biotechnology field which could advance our MSCs and neurodegenerative research. as well as treat other indications. There can be no assurance that we will reach agreement on this alliance or that the necessary financing will be available to implement the research under the alliance. In such event, we may explore other relationships with other third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we have not previously sought to develop or commercialize, decide to exit our existing business, cease operations altogether or pursue an acquisition of our company. However, without additional financing, we do not believe our resources will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs beyond the third quarter of 2024. 30 Table of Contents Offering The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on January 11, 2022, to offer and sell up to 2,500,000 shares of common stock in a self-underwritten primary offering at a fixed price of 0.70 per share which was declared effective on March 21, 2022. The offering terminated two years from effective date or March 21, 2024, and no shares were sold under the Offering. Going Concern Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. Our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, includes an explanatory paragraph stating the Company has recurring losses and limited operations which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, the Company may be required to reduce the scope, delay, or eliminate some or all of its planned operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide this information. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as of September 30, 2024, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, based on the material weaknesses discussed below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Act Commission s rules and forms and that our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our internal controls and procedures are not effective for the following reasons: (i) there is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives as management is comprised of only two persons, one of which is the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and, (ii) the Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process. In order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness, we have engaged an outside accounting consultant with significant experience in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that these financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of this action and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. We would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will continue to reassess this matter to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible. In addition, we would need to expand our board to include independent members.
