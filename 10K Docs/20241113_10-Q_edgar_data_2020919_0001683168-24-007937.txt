 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 (Unaudited) 

at September 30, 2024. The Company
currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover
operating costs over an extended period of time. 

Management anticipates that the Company will be
dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so
that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances
that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern. 

Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties
include (a) affiliates of the Company; (b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election
of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825 10 15, to be accounted for by the equity method
by the investing entity; (c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under
the trusteeship of management; (d) principal owners of the Company; (e) management of the Company; (f) other parties with which the Company
may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one
of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g) other parties that can significantly
influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting
parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully
pursuing its own separate interests.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

We are a development-stage company currently launching
operations in software development and the online industry. We created a comprehensive, all-in-one platform for seamless project planning
and performance management. Platform is located at www. https://deltasoft.work. Our promoting web
site is https://deltasoft360.com/ . Here are the current benefits users can experience: 

Planning 

 At the project planning stage, the DeltaSoft program
now allows for quick and detailed creation of project descriptions and requirements, both through convenient and thoughtful forms/surveys
and with the help of AI. 

Tasks 

 During the task creation stage for project implementation,
the DeltaSoft program enables quick and easy creation and division of the main project into a series of subprojects and tasks for direct
execution. This can be done independently using forms in the control panel or by utilizing AI functionality. 

Performers 

 The DeltaSoft program assists in selecting and
distributing performers (freelancers) and creating a team for specific projects or individual tasks. Users can create advertisements independently
in the control panel or with the help of AI, which suggests a list of roles for a specific project and helps create advertisements. 

Project Management and Tracking 

 For project management, the DeltaSoft program
offers a range of functionalities to ensure the most convenient and effective task execution. These include features like WBS (Work Breakdown
Structure), stages, roadmap, weekly planning, product hub, and more. 

In summary, the DeltaSoft program facilitates
the quick and convenient creation and execution of projects, products, or any other complex tasks, guiding the user through all stages
of execution. The integrated AI functionality significantly saves time, speeding up and simplifying each stage, ultimately leading to
maximum efficiency and speed of project execution. 

Currently, we are at the beginning of a marketing
campaign to promote our website platform. We will create additional websites to explain our services and attract our potential customers.
Our platform is operational, and we are working on improving and maintaining it. 

Application Structure from the User s
Perspective. 

The application is organized into 5 primary sections:
Overview, Projects, Tasks, People, and Reporting, each designed to streamline the user s experience. 

Overview 

 This is the entry point for users, presenting
a comprehensive snapshot or bird s eye view of the current status across all projects. It s tailored to give users a quick
and broad understanding of their projects standings at a glance. 

Projects 

 In the Projects section, users are provided with
a list showcasing each project along with vital details like the project s current status, assigned team members, progress, and
more. Selecting a project navigates the user to a page dedicated to that project, offering a detailed description, a list of subprojects,
and the specific tasks required for the project s completion. 

Tasks 

 Upon selecting a specific task, users can access
detailed information about it. The Tasks section is particularly useful as it compiles a list of all tasks across all projects, sorted
by time frames such as today, tomorrow, and the upcoming week. This organization helps users understand the scope of work for any chosen
period, facilitating better planning and management. 

13 

People 

 The People category is designed to show users
a roster of team members, detailing who is assigned to which project and their respective tasks. This feature aids in the coordination
and allocation of resources efficiently. 

Reporting 

 Finally, the Reporting section allows users to
view the list of tasks in a graphical format. This visual representation is intended to help users easily track progress and task distribution,
providing a clear and immediate understanding of project dynamics and workload distribution. 

Revenue 

Our revenue strategy centers on the markup on
freelancer fees. This approach means we ll charge our clients a premium over the rates we pay to freelancers for their services. 

Profit Margin: By adopting this model, we aim
to derive a direct profit from the transactions facilitated on our soon-to-launch platform. The discrepancy between the charges to clients
and payments to freelancers will constitute our profit margin, potentially becoming a significant revenue stream. We anticipate that clients
will value the simplicity and transparency of handling payments through our platform, being prepared to pay extra for the convenience
and reliability it offers. 

Competition and Marketing 

Our competitors would be other platforms that
facilitate freelance work across various sectors, including but not limited to technology, design, writing, marketing, and consulting
services. Some of the well-known competitors in this space include: 

1. 
 Upwork - A global freelancing platform where businesses and independent professionals connect and collaborate remotely. 

2. 
 Fiverr - An online marketplace for freelance services, offering a platform for freelancers to offer services to customers worldwide. 

3. 
 Freelancer.com - One of the largest freelancing and crowdsourcing marketplaces by number of users and projects. 

4. 
 Toptal - A network of freelance software engineers, designers, and finance experts, focusing on connecting top-tier freelancers with corporate clients. 

5. 
 Guru - A platform that provides freelancers the opportunity to find various jobs and projects in multiple disciplines. 

6. 
 PeoplePerHour - This platform enables clients to find freelance workers for specific projects, with a wide range of skill sets available. 

To market our platform that connects freelancers
with clients and earns revenue through markup on freelancer fees, we will implement a comprehensive strategy: 

Content Marketing : We will create valuable,
SEO-optimized content aimed at both freelancers and clients to position ourselves as industry leaders. 

Social Media Marketing : We ll actively
engage with our audience on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, and run targeted advertising campaigns to reach specific demographics. 

Email Marketing: We plan to build an email
list by offering resources that add value, through which we ll send regular updates and personalized content. 

Referral Programs : We ll incentivize
our current users to refer new freelancers and clients by offering rewards, enhancing our user base organically. 

Partnerships and Collaborations : We aim
to partner with industry influencers and other platforms for increased visibility and mutually beneficial promotions. 

PPC Advertising : We will invest in PPC
campaigns on platforms like Google Ads to direct targeted traffic to our site. 

14 

Networking and Community Building : We ll
engage with online communities relevant to our target audience and host events like webinars to showcase our platform s benefits. 

Highlighting Competitive Advantages : We ll
ensure our platform s unique features and benefits are well communicated to differentiate us from competitors. 

Leveraging Customer Testimonials : Success
stories and testimonials from satisfied users will be shared to build trust and credibility among potential users. 

Public Relations: We plan to generate media
coverage by pitching interesting stories about our platform to industry publications and news outlet 

Employees; Identification of Certain Significant
Employees. 

We have no employees other than our sole
officer and director, Andrey Novokhatski, who currently devotes approximately twenty hours per week to company matters. 

RESULTS OF OPERATION 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional capital
to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or
debt securities.

As of September 30, 2024,
the Company s total assets were 27,556 consisting of cash 556) and intangible assets 27,000). As of September 30, 2024, our

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Cash flows from financing activities for the six
months ended September 30, 2024, was 5,000. 

Plan of Operation and Funding 

As of the date of this Form 10-Q, the current
funds available to the Company should be sufficient to continue maintaining our reporting status until we raise funds from our offering.
In case raising funds will take longer than planned, or our short-term expenses exceed our expectations, the company s sole officer
and director, Andrey Novokhatski, has indicated that he may be willing to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the
form of a non-secured loan until minimum required proceeds are obtained by the Company. However, there is no contract in place or written
agreement securing this agreement. We believe that we will obtain this loan from our director as he is the majority owner of the company
and therefore has an incentive to finance us. 

Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared "assuming
that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business. 

Our auditors have issued a going concern 
opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our
plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in our offering. We must raise cash to implement our
strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources
required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being
a reporting public company will be approximately 14,000. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk. 

No report required. 

16 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was
no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
