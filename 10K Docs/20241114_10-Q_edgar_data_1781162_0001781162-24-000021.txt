CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q ), including, without limitation, statements under the headings "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Securities Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"). Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning Momentus Inc. s (the Company, Momentus, we, us, or our possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words "believes," "estimates," "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "may," "will," "potential," "projects," "predicts," "continue," or "should," or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the ability of the Company to raise additional capital to finance its operations and business plan; the results of the Company s evaluation of the strategic alternatives and the risks associated with any transactions pursued as a results thereof; the ability of the Company to obtain licenses and government approvals for its missions, which are essential to its operations; successful completion of our efforts to prepare our spacecraft for flight, that the vehicles that we plan to operate in future missions will be ready on time, or that they will operate as intended; the ability of the Company to effectively market and sell satellite buses; the ability of the Company to protect its intellectual property and trade secrets; the development of markets for satellite transport and in-orbit services; the ability of the Company to develop, test and validate its technology, including its water plasma propulsion technology; delays or impediments that the Company may face in the development, manufacture and deployment of next generation satellite transport systems; the ability of the Company to convert backlog or inbound inquiries into revenue; changes in applicable laws or regulations and extensive and evolving government regulations that impact operations and business, including export control license requirements; the ability to attract or maintain a qualified workforce with the required security clearances and requisite skills; level of product service or product or launch failures or delays that could lead customers to use competitors services; investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation and/or other regulatory or legal proceedings; the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and/or other risks and uncertainties

 described under Part II, Item 1A: " Risk Factors ," in this Form 10-Q and under Part I, Item 1A. in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on June 6, 2024. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. These risks and others described under Part II, Item 1A: "Risk Factors," in this Form 10-Q and under Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 6, 2024, may not be exhaustive. 
 By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. In addition, even if our results or operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

missions to date, deployed customer satellites, and provided hosted payload services. of these missions involved operation of the Vigoride OSV in orbit. During these Vigoride missions, the system and technology were tested repeatedly. Improvements based on lessons learned during these missions were rapidly incorporated. As a result of these missions, the Vigoride OSV has been successfully demonstrated in space and accumulated significant flight heritage. The Company has produced its next Orbital Service Vehicle, Vigoride 7, that it intends to utilize on a future mission or for use as a satellite bus. 
 In addition to the Vigoride Orbital Service Vehicle, Momentus is now also offering its M-1000 satellite bus which has substantial commonality with Vigoride. With a growing demand for satellite bus services, Momentus is positioned to advance its hardware and flight-proven technology for this market. The M-1000 bus is a flexible option to meet various mission requirements. Innovations to improve sensor capability, maneuverability, increased power, and lower costs are integrated into the product. Momentus believes it can manufacture satellite buses like the M-1000 at a rapid and scalable pace. 
 Momentus has completed work in support of its Small Business Innovation Research contract from the Space Development Agency that was signed in August 2023. This project's scope involved making tailored modifications to the system underlying the M-1000 satellite bus and Vigoride OSV to support a full range of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) payloads. Some of these areas include adding a secure payload interface, optical communications terminals, a high-volume data recorder, and improving the modularity of the propulsion system. 
 Business Combination 
 On August 12, 2021, the Company consummated a merger pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 7, 2020, and as amended on March 5, 2021, April 6, 2021, and June 29, 2021 (the Merger Agreement ), by and among Stable Road Acquisition Corp SRAC ), Project Marvel First Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of SRAC First Merger Sub ), and Project Marvel Second Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of SRAC Second Merger Sub ), pursuant to which First Merger Sub merged with and into Momentus Inc., a Delaware corporation Legacy Momentus with Legacy Momentus as the surviving corporation of the First Merger Sub, and immediately following which Legacy Momentus merged with and into the Second Merger Sub, with the Second Merger Sub as the surviving entity (the Business Combination ). In connection with the closing of the Business Combination Closing ), the Company changed its name from Stable Road Acquisition Corp. to Momentus Inc., and Legacy Momentus changed its name to Momentus Space, LLC. 
 The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , with SRAC and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company received gross proceeds of million upon the closing of the Business Combination. Public and private warrants of SRAC were assumed by the Company as a result of the Business Combination. 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these consolidated interim financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to successfully raise capital to fund its business operations and execute on its business plan. To date the Company remains heavily focused on growth and continued

 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company used net cash of million to fund its operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and had cash and cash equivalents of million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Pursuant to the requirements of ASC Sub-Topic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date these consolidated interim financial statements are issued. This evaluation does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented or are not within control of the Company as of the date the consolidated interim financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the consolidated interim financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated interim financial statements are issued. 
 In connection with the preparation of the consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management conducted an evaluation and concluded that there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, which raised substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months after the date of the issuance of such consolidated interim financial statements. The Company believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund its regular operations, scaling of commercial production, and maintain its existing services and products. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated interim financial statements. In order to proceed with the Company s business plan and operating strategy, the Company will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its operations. Until such time, if ever, the Company can generate revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, the Company expects to finance its operations through equity or debt financings, which may not be available to the Company on the timing needed or on terms that the Company deems to be favorable. In an effort to alleviate these conditions, the Company continues to seek and evaluate all opportunities to access additional capital through any available means. 
 As a result of these uncertainties, and notwithstanding management s plans and efforts to date, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to raise substantial additional capital in the near term, the Company's operations and business plan will need to be scaled back or halted altogether. Additionally, if the Company is able to raise additional capital but that capital is insufficient to provide a bridge to full commercial production at a profit, the Company's operations could be severely curtailed or cease entirely and the Company may not realize any significant value from its assets. 
 The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting. The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 Effective August 22, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of the Company s Class A common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 50 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding on August 22, 2023, were automatically combined into one share of Class A common stock. Any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were rounded up to the next nearest whole share of Class A common stock. The reverse stock split did not affect the stated par value of the Class A common stock nor did it change the total number of the Company s authorized shares of Class A common stock. Both the Company s Class B common stock and the Company s preferred stock were not affected by the reverse stock split. 
 Also on the effective date of the reverse stock split, all options, warrants and other convertible securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the reverse stock split were adjusted by dividing the number of shares of

Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase share of the Company s Class A common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustments and will expire after the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
 The Private Warrants do not meet the derivative scope exception and are accounted for as derivative liabilities. Specifically, the Private Warrants contain provisions that cause the settlement amounts to be dependent upon the characteristics of the holder of the warrant which is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. Therefore, the Private Warrants are not considered indexed to the Company s stock and should be classified

 million, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital. Similarly, on the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company recorded a liability related to the Private Warrants of million, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital. 
 The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC Topic 815, at the initial recognition. 
 Other than the Public and Private Warrants noted above, the Company also had other warrants issued and outstanding which were recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 815 until they were fully exercised. Accordingly, the Company recognized the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period until exercised. The fair value of the warrant liabilities issued were initially measured using the Black-Scholes model and were subsequently remeasured at each reporting period with changes recorded as a component of other income in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Derivative warrant liabilities are classified as non-current as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities.

 Legal Proceedings 
 Securities Class Actions 
 On July 15, 2021, a purported stockholder of SRAC filed a putative class action complaint against SRAC, SRC-NI Holdings, LLC ("Sponsor"), Brian Kabot (SRAC CEO), James Norris (SRAC CFO), Momentus, and the Company's co-founder and former CEO, Mikhail Kokorich, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, in a case captioned Jensen v. Stable Road Acquisition Corp., et al. , No. 2:21-cv-05744 (the " Jensen class action"). The complaint alleges that the defendants omitted certain material information in their public statements and disclosures regarding the Business Combination, in violation of the securities laws, and seeks damages on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who purchased SRAC stock between October 7, 2020 and July 13, 2021. Subsequent complaints captioned Hall v. Stable Road Acquisition Corp., et al. , No. 2:21-cv-05943 and Depoy v. Stable Road Acquisition Corp., et al. , No. 2:21-cv-06287 were consolidated in the first filed matter (collectively, referred to as the "Securities Class Actions"). An amended complaint was filed on November 12, 2021. The Company disputes the allegations in the Securities Class Actions. 
 On February 10, 2023, the lead plaintiff in the Securities Class Actions and the Company reached an agreement in principle to settle the Securities Class Actions. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, the lead plaintiff, on behalf of a class of all persons that purchased or otherwise acquired Company stock between October 7, 2020 and July 13, 2021, inclusive, would release the Company from all claims asserted or that could have been asserted in the Securities Class Actions and dismiss such claims with prejudice, in exchange for payment of million by the Company (at least million of which was funded by insurance proceeds). 
 On April 10, 2023, the parties filed a Notice of Settlement with the Court, and on August 18, 2023, the parties executed a Settlement Agreement. On August 30, 2023 the lead plaintiff filed a Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement, and the Court entered an Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement and Providing for Notice on September 21, 2023. Pursuant to that Order, on October 5, 2023, the Company paid million into the settlement escrow account. On November 16, 2023, following the Court s order granting lead plaintiff s motion to enforce the settlement agreement and despite the Company s attempts to negotiate an extension of time to satisfy its payment obligations, the Company paid an additional million into the settlement escrow account. Insurance carriers made additional payments totaling million into the settlement escrow account. 
 On April 23, 2024, the Court entered an order and judgment finally approving the settlement of the Securities Class Actions. A group of plaintiffs asserting the Delaware Class Actions (see below) objected to the scope of the release in the settlement, and the Court overruled the objection. Those objectors may or may not appeal the Court s decision to overrule their objections and approve the settlement. The Company does not know the timing of when such an appeal, if filed, would be heard. If the objectors do not appeal the approval of the settlement, or if their appeal is ultimately rejected by the Court of Appeal, then the settlement will resolve all claims in the Securities Class Actions against the Company (except as to any shareholders that may elect to opt-out of the class). The Company and the other defendants have denied and continue to deny each and all of the claims alleged in the Securities Class Actions, and the proposed settlement contains no admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the defendants. In the event that a court, on appeal or otherwise, overturns the approval of the settlement, the Company will continue to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in the Securities Class Actions. 
 As a result of the agreement to settle the Securities Class Action, the Company recorded a litigation settlement contingency of million. The Company additionally recorded an insurance receivable of million for the insurance proceeds expected from its insurers related to the settlement. The net amount of million was recognized in litigation settlement, net during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2024, the contingent liability in relation to Securities Class Action has been paid in full.

No. 2022-0519, to inspect the books and records of the Company pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 Shareholder Derivative Litigation 
 On June 20, 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed by Brian Lindsey, on behalf of the Company, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. 2:22-cv-04212, against the Company (as a nominal defendant), SRAC, Brian Kabot, Juan Manuel Quiroga, James Norris, James Hofmockel, Mikhail Kokorich, Dawn Harms, Fred Kennedy, Chris Hadfield, Mitchel B. Kugler, Victorino Mercado, Kimberly A. Reed, Linda J. Reiners, and John C. Rood. This derivative action alleges the same core allegations as stated in the securities class action litigation. Defendants dispute the allegations as stated in this derivative action. On September 27, 2022, Plaintiff filed his Notice of Voluntary Dismissal without Prejudice seeking to dismiss the case. Because Plaintiff s dismissal of this derivative action was voluntary and without prejudice, this plaintiff and/or other shareholders may seek to re-file the claims asserted in this matter at a later date. As noted below, Brian Lindsey re-filed a shareholder derivative action in Delaware Chancery Court on June 30, 2023.

related to a stockholder litigation demand letter submitted to Momentus, dated July 20, 2021 on behalf of Joel Zalvin, a purported stockholder of Momentus. The stockholder litigation demand letter asserted that the vote to increase the number of shares of Class A common stock of Momentus at the special meeting of stockholders on August 11, 2021 was conducted in violation of Delaware law. On March 14, 2023, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the Company s request pursuant to 8 Del. C. 205, or Section 205 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the Petition in order to validate and declare effective the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and validate and declare effective the shares of the Company s Class A common stock issued in reliance on such provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as of the date of the original issuance of such shares. Further on March 14, 2023, the Court of Chancery entered an order under 8 Del. C. 205 (i) declaring the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, including the filing and effectiveness thereof, as validated and effective retroactive to the date of its filing with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 12, 2021, and (ii) ordering that the Company s Class A common stock (and the issuance of the Class A common stock) described in the Petition and any other securities issued in reliance of the validity of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company are validated and declared effective, each as of the original issuance dates. Momentus did not take action in response to the July 20, 2021 demand letter, but rather filed the Petition over one year later, following a decision by the Delaware Chancery Court that created uncertainty as to the validity of the Company s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Accordingly, Momentus believes that the threatened claim is without merit and intends to vigorously defend any such claim if brought. 
 Prior to the close of the Business Combination, Alex Ciccotelli, represented by Rigrodsky Law, sent SRAC a disclosure demand letter dated November 9, 2020, and Jeffrey Justice II, represented by Grabar Law Office, sent SRAC a disclosure demand letter dated August 3, 2021. Mr. Ciccotelli then filed a civil action against SRAC. After receiving various shareholder disclosure demands, SRAC voluntarily issued certain pre-closing supplemental disclosures, without admission, as stated in its August 5, 2021 Form 8-K filing. The Ciccotelli action was thereafter dismissed as moot. On March 20, 2023, Rigrodsky Law threatened to file a fee petition seeking an award of fees and expenses if the Company does not agree to pay a mootness fee, and more recently, in October 2023, reiterated the

 Shareholder Derivative Litigation (Hanna, Lindsey, and Rivlin) 
 The plaintiffs have moved for final approval of the proposed settlement to resolve all actions. This settlement approval motion is currently scheduled for a hearing on November 21, 2024, in the Hanna case (U.S.D.C., Northern District of California). To date, the parties have not received any objection to the settlement or any opposition to the motion for final settlement approval. 
 Other Litigation and Relat ed Matters 
 These and other litigation matters may be time-consuming, divert management s attention and resources, cause the Company to incur significant defense and settlement costs or liability, even if we believe the claims asserted against us are without merit. We intend to vigorously defend against all such claims. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, as well as claims for indemnity from various of the parties concerned, we may from time to time settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, further compounded by various claims for indemnity which may or may not be fully insured, we cannot assure that the results of these actions, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
 From time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business or in connection with the matters discussed above. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under ASC Sub-Topic 450-20. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. 
 
 percent. The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period and can be influenced by many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes to the statutory rates in the jurisdictions where the Company has operations and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily relates to certain nondeductible items, state and local income taxes, the absence of current income tax, and a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. 
 
 promissory notes for an aggregate amount of million to participating directors and an officer of the Company. The proceeds from the notes were used to pay for employee retention payments, working capital, and general corporate expenses. Each note issued bore an annual interest rate of equal to the minimum applicable federal rate published by the Internal Revenue Service for June 2024. Each note held a maturity date of September 30, 2024 and was secured by the Company s assets. Principal and interest payments were due by the maturity date and the notes would have become immediately due upon the occurrence of certain customary event of default, including failure to pay amounts owing when due and/or certain events involving a discontinuation of our business or certain types of proceedings involving insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership and the like. On September 12, 2024, the promissory notes were repaid in full to the participating directors and officer of the Company.

million in tranches, consisting of (i) an initial loan in the principal amount of million, and (ii) up to an additional million in principal amount which may be borrowed from December 22, 2024 through February 14, 2025. Borrowings under the October Convertible Note bear interest at per annum. The October Convertible Note has a maturity date of October 24, 2025, at which time all principal and accrued interest is due. 
 Amounts borrowed under the October Convertible Note are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company. At any time after the date that is six months after the original issuance date of the October Convertible Note, SIV, in its sole discretion, may convert some or all of the outstanding obligations under the October Convertible Note into shares of Class A common stock at a conversion price of per share. 
 In addition to the October Convertible Note, the Company agreed to issue to SIV warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share (the SIV Warrants ). SIV may not exercise the SIV Warrants prior to April 24, 2025, and the SIV Warrants will expire April 24, 2030. 
 Neither the October Convertible Note nor the SIV Warrants can be converted or exercised if it would cause the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by SIV to exceed of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the conversion or exercise, as applicable. Conversion of the October Convertible Note and exercise of the SIV Warrants is also subject to compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules, and if shareholder approval is required the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approval. 
 The October Convertible Note requires SIV s consent to take certain actions, such as purchasing assets outside the ordinary course of business, extending financing, making capital expenditures in excess of million, repaying debts outside the ordinary course of business or investing in any entity or enterprise. 
 The October Convertible Note can be prepaid in full at any time, subject to a prepayment fee of . The October Convertible Note will accelerate and become immediately due upon the occurrence of certain customary events of default, including failure to pay amounts owing when due and/or certain events involving a discontinuation of our business or certain types of proceedings involving insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership and the like, or a change of control of the Company.

 Overview 
 Momentus offers or plans to offer satellites, satellite buses, satellite technologies including solar arrays, and transportation and infrastructure services to help enable the commercialization of space for commercial companies and to support the missions of U.S. and friendly governments missions. Satellite operators are our target commercial customers. Momentus is also seeking business in support of U.S. Government missions for Departments and Agencies like NASA and the Department of Defense. 
 
 Products and services that we plan to provide include provision of satellites, satellite buses, satellite technologies including solar arrays, integration of payload instruments, last mile satellite transportation, payload-hosting, on-orbit satellite refueling, on-orbit inspection, on-orbit satellite maintenance, de-orbiting, debris removal, and other satellite-to-satellite service offerings. 
 Our transportation service offering focuses on delivering our customers satellites to precision orbits of their choosing. To accomplish this, we partner with leading launch service providers, such as SpaceX to ride share our customers' satellites from Earth to space on a midsized or large rocket. Customer satellites can also be carried aboard small launch vehicles for dedicated missions. Our OSVs would then provide last mile transportation services from the rocket s drop-off orbit to a custom orbit of the satellite operator s choosing. We believe this hub-and-spoke model has the potential to expand our customers deployment options relative to what they would be able to achieve with ride share launch alone, while reducing their costs relative to what they could achieve with a dedicated small launch vehicle. Over time, we plan to begin introducing additional services beyond transportation and hosted payloads. 
 Since Momentus founding in 2017, we have been working to develop, test and enhance our vehicles and supporting technologies, particularly our water plasma propulsion technology. 
 Our services are made possible by the space industry s rapid technological developments over the past two decades, driven predominantly by significant decreases in launch costs, as well as the advent of smaller, lower-cost satellites. The convergence of these trends has resulted in substantial growth in the commercial space market, rooted in higher accessibility for companies entering the new space economy that aim to offer communication, earth observation and data collection services, and other satellite services. 
 We anticipate potential considerable growth over the coming years in the space transportation segment as companies continue to seek versatile and low-cost ways to deliver single satellites to specific orbits or deploy their satellite constellations. We anticipate that the need for small satellite transportation to low-earth orbit will continue to drive overall demand growth for space transportation services in the short-term as technology advancements continue to make space more accessible to new market entrants, although new applications beyond low-earth orbit are also emerging. We also believe that over the next decade, new space-based businesses may emerge, for example the generation of solar energy in space, space manufacturing or space data processing. The advent of these new business models could substantially increase demand for space transportation and other space infrastructure services.

Table of Contents 

 Beyond transportation, we anticipate that growth of the satellite constellations market may drive demand for our satellites, satellites buses, and technologies like solar arrays, hosted payload, on-orbit satellite refueling, on-orbit inspection, on-orbit satellite maintenance, de-orbiting, debris removal, and other satellite-to-satellite service offerings, if we are successful in executing on our business plan, including fully developing and validating our technology in space. Satellite constellations have relatively low lifespans and, in our view, will require maintenance, de-orbiting, and other general servicing with higher frequency. 
 Momentus has developed the M-1000 satellite bus that the Company is offering to both commercial and U.S. government customers. The market for satellite buses in this class is substantial and growing. The M-1000 satellite bus is based on the Vigoride OSV and has substantial commonality. 
 Momentus has launched four missions to date, deployed 17 customer satellites, and provided hosted payload services. Three of these missions involved operation of the Vigoride OSV in orbit. During these three Vigoride missions, the system and technology were tested repeatedly. Improvements based on lessons learned during these missions were rapidly incorporated. As a result of these three missions, the Vigoride OSV has been successfully demonstrated in space and accumulated significant flight heritage. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Service Revenue 
 We enter into contracts for last-mile satellite and cargo delivery, payload hosting and in-orbit servicing options with customers that are primarily in the aerospace industry. The Company recognizes revenue (along with any other fees that have been paid) upon the earlier of the satisfaction of our performance obligation or when the customer cancels the contract. The Company also enters into contracts to perform analysis and provide engineering services to U.S. Government organizations. 
 In general, our customers have the right to cancel their contracts with the understanding that they will forgo their deposits. If a customer cancels a contract before it is required to pay non-refundable deposits, we may not receive revenue from these orders, except for an initial deposit which is paid at the time the contract is signed. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 0.1 million of revenue, primarily from the completion of performance obligations on engineering services performed for U.S. government and engineering project services. 
 As of September 30, 2024 we have signed contracts with customers and have collected approximately 1.6 million in customer deposits, 1.1 million of which are recorded as non-current contract liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. While the Company s standard contracts do not contain refund or recourse provisions that enable its customers to recover any non-refundable fees that have been paid, the Company may issue full or partial refunds to customers on a case-by-case basis as necessary to preserve and foster future business relationships and customer goodwill. Contracts to provide engineering services to U.S. Government organizations generally have milestone payments subject to the variable consideration constraint. When a milestone is achieved, the Company updates its estimate of the transaction price to include the milestone payment and records a cumulative catch-up in revenue. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with third-party launch costs and direct headcount cost related to the engineering project. Development of the orbital service vehicles is part of the Company s technology roadmap. Therefore, to date, the cost of these orbital service vehicles has been expensed as research and development costs as materials and services are received. The current design and technology allow for a single use of the orbital service vehicle. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenditures consist primarily of the cost of the following activities for developing existing and future technologies for our satellites, satellite technologies, and our Orbital Service Vehicles. Research and development activities include basic research, applied research, design, development, and related test program activities. Costs incurred for developing our technologies primarily include equipment, material, and labor hours 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 (both internal and subcontractors). The Company also records launch costs related to the testing of its Vigoride vehicles as research and development costs. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have expensed all research and development costs associated with developing and building our vehicles. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of human capital related expenses for employees involved in general corporate functions, including executive management and administration, accounting, finance, tax, legal, information technology, security, sales, marketing, and human resources; depreciation expense and rent relating to facilities, and equipment; professional fees; and other general corporate costs. Headcount-related expenses primarily include salaries, bonuses, equity compensation expense and benefits. 
 We also incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses necessary to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange and related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 
 Changes in the fair value of warrants consists of changes in the estimated fair value of our warrant liability. 
 Realized loss on disposal of assets 
 Realized loss on disposal of assets consists of disposals of machinery and equipment with carrying values in excess of proceeds received, if any. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest earned by the Company on investment holdings in interest bearing bank accounts. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense includes interest incurred by the Company related to our loan payables as well as the amortization of warrant discount and debt issuance costs. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) primarily relates to non-recurring fees incurred in conjunction with the Term Loan financing, SEC settlement cost, and other immaterial items. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States. Our income tax provision consists of an estimate of federal and state income taxes based on enacted federal and state tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws. 
 The effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period and can be influenced by many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes to the statutory rates in the jurisdictions where the Company has operations and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily relates to certain nondeductible items, state and local income taxes and a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

 Service revenue 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 The Company recognized 0.1 million of revenue, primarily driven by engineering services in relation to the fulfillment of performance obligations in the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency agreement DARPA Agreement ). 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized 0.3 million of revenue, primarily from the completion of performance obligation in connection with the Vigoride 5 and Vigoride 6 missions as well as some forfeited customer deposits upon contract expiration. 
 Cost of revenue 
 The costs associated with performing engineering service in relation to the DARPA Agreement were capitalized in cost of revenue. We tracked the individual hours worked in the project and allocated the portion of headcount cost from research and development operating expenses to cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2023 consists primarily of expenses associated with the cost of the orbital service vehicle and third-party launch costs. Until the orbital service vehicle design is completed and released for production, the cost of these orbital service vehicles is being expensed as research and development costs as materials and services are received. The current design and technology allow for a single use of the orbital service vehicle. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses decreased from 6.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was mostly headcount driven whereas payroll related cost went down by a 2.5 million including a decrease of 0.2 million in non-cash stock based compensation. Subcontractor costs decreased by 1.0 million. Additionally, there was a 0.1 million decrease in spending on materials and a 0.1 million decrease in information technology and facilities expense. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 9.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 by 0.2 million and SEC and legal services expenses decreased by 1.7 million. Consulting and other professional services and other general corporate expenses decreased by 0.7 million and 0.1 million, respectively. 
 Change in fair value of w arrant liability 
 For both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the decrease of 0.2 million in the calculated fair value of the Company s outstanding warrants, which were assumed from the Business Combination, was primarily driven by the observable market price of the publicly listed warrants to purchase the Company s stock under comparable terms. See Note 9 for additional information. 
 Realized loss on disposal of assets 
 Realized loss on disposal of assets in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.1 million while in 2023, was zero. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased from 0.2 million for three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as the Company invested less money market funds given liquidity constrains. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense decreased from 0.5 million of cash and amortization interest for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 42,500 interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the application of the effective interest method which results in less cash and amortization interest as the Term Loan approaches maturity. See Note 8 for additional information. 
 Other income 
 Other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was immaterial.

The decrease was primarily due to (i) a 8.6 million reduction in payroll costs due to decreased headcount and related decreases in signing bonuses (ii) a 4.8 million reduction on subcontractor cost, (iii) a 2.1 million reduction in spending on materials and components, (iv) decreases in launch costs of 1.9 million associated with impairment of our Space X and ABL deposits, and amortization of the Vigoride 5 and Vigoride 6 missions, (v) a 0.6 million reduction in allocated information technology and facilities expenses, and (vi) a 0.5 million decrease in other overhead costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 29.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 16.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily due to (i) a 3.8 million decrease in payroll related expenses inclusive 0.4 million of stock based compensation. Factors contributing to the decrease was primarily due to prior year one-time bonuses and executive departures temporarily replaced by consultants (ii) a 3.2 million decrease in legal services expenses followed by (iii) a 1.1 million decrease in NSA compliance spending and (iv) a 1.2 million decrease in SEC compliance spending as the Company s activity related to the NSA and SEC topics discussed in Note 12 shifted from legal proceedings to compliance. (v) Non legal professional fees decreased by 2.3 million and other general corporate office expenses (including insurance costs) decreased by 1.3 million partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in IT overhead costs. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in the calculated fair value of the Company s currently outstanding warrants, which were assumed from the Business Combination, was primarily driven by the observable market price of the publicly listed warrants to purchase the Company s stock under comparable terms. See Note 9 for additional information. 
 Realized loss on disposal of assets 
 Realized loss on disposal of assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million while 2023, was immaterial. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased from 1.1 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 24 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the Company invested less in money market funds due to liquidity constrains. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense decreased from 2.2 million of cash and amortization interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.1 million of cash and amortization interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the application of the effective interest method which results in less cash and amortization interest as the Term Loan approaches maturity. See Note 8 for additional information. 
 Other income 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 Other income increased from 20 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.1 million nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was related to the release of interest accrued in relation to the loan during 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Going Concern 
 The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to successfully raise capital to fund its business operations and execute on its business plan. To date, the Company has not generated sufficient revenues to provide cash flows that enable the Company to finance its operations internally and the Company s financial position and operating results raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. This is reflected by the Company s incurred net losses of 23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had an accumulated deficit of 396.1 million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company used net cash of 10.9 million to fund its operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and had cash and cash equivalents of 0.8 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of the consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management conducted an evaluation and concluded that there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, which raised substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months after the date of the issuance of such financial statements. The Company believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and sale of its services and products. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated interim financial statements. In order to proceed with the Company s business plan and operating strategy, the Company will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its operations. Until such time, if ever, the Company can generate revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, the Company expects to finance its operations through equity or debt financings, which may not be available to the Company on the timing needed or on terms that the Company deems to be favorable. In an effort to alleviate these conditions, the Company continues to seek and evaluate opportunities to access additional capital through all available means. 
 
 As a result of these uncertainties, and notwithstanding management s plans and efforts to date, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to raise substantial additional capital in the near term, the Company's operations and business plan will need to be scaled back or halted altogether. Additionally, if the Company is able to raise additional capital but that capital is insufficient to provide a bridge to full commercial production at a profit, the Company's operations could be severely curtailed or cease entirely and the Company may not realize any significant value from its assets. 
 
 The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting. The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (10,874) (45,987) Investing activities 94 (7) Financing activities 9,586 (5,905) Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (1,194) (51,899) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.9 million, driven primarily by headcount costs, research and development activities, legal expenses, and professional fees, as well as net cash changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 Headcount related payroll costs, excluding stock-based compensation of 4.9 million, were 7.3 million. Professional fees of 5.1 million included 2.6 million in legal fees discussed in Note 12. Office overheads and other general corporate expenses were 4.4 million, which includes insurance costs of 1.3 million. Research and Development activity expenses, including materials, components, and subcontractor costs were 1.5 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by gross profit of 1.8 million primarily related to the fulfillment of performance

 obligations for Vigoride 5 and Vigoride 6 customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company had a change in operating assets and liabilities of 5.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 46.0 million, driven primarily by headcount costs, research and development activities, legal expenses, and professional fees, as well as net cash changes in operating assets and liabilities. Headcount related payroll costs, excluding accrued bonus of 2.6 million and stock-based compensation of 6.5 million, were 5.5 million. Research and development activity expenses, including materials, components, and subcontractor costs were 3.6 million. Professional fees of 4.9 million included 0.6 million of costs related to the SEC and NSA topics discussed in Note 12 and legal fees of 2.4 million. Office overheads, other general corporate expenses, and cash interest were 1.5 million, which includes insurance costs of 0.8 million. The Company also incurred launch costs of 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, that were amortized in connection with its first launch. The Company additionally had change in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of 0.9 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 94 thousand and 7 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which consisted of purchases of machinery and equipment and intangible assets and proceeds received on the sale of machinery and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to gross proceeds of approximately 10.8 million received from the January Offering and March Offering, and 2.3 million received from SIV partially offset by principal repayments of 2.3 million under the Term Loan and 1.1 million in issuance costs related to common stock and related warrants. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to principal repayment under the Term Loan. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We expect our cash consumption to continue in connection with our ongoing activities. 
 Specifically, our operating expenses will continue as we: 
 continue to refine and operate our corporate infrastructure, people, processes and systems; 
 pursue sales and marketing activities for our product and services; 
 pursue further research and development related to developing our satellites, satellite technology, and Orbital Service Vehicles; 
 seek regulatory approvals for operation of our satellites and vehicles; 
 actively manage our workforce, including right sizing in personnel; 
 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 
 comply with public company reporting requirements; and 
 defend against litigation. 
 Changing circumstances may cause us to expend capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, or we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. 
 Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in more detail under Part II, Item 1A: " Risk Factors ," in this Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors We may not be able to continue as a going concern.

 Commitments and Contingencies 
 We are a party to operating leases primarily for facilities (e.g., office buildings, warehouses and spaceport) under non-cancellable operating leases. We lease office space under a non-cancellable operating lease which expires February 2028. Refer to Note 6. 
 We enter into purchase obligations in the normal course of business. These obligations include purchase orders and agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding, and have significant terms and minimum purchases stipulated. Refer to Note 12. 
 In addition, we enter into agreements in the normal course of business with vendors for research and development services and outsourced services, which are generally cancellable upon written notice. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not engage in any off-balance sheet activities or have any arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as variable interest, special purpose, and structured finance entities. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated interim financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated interim financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments as of the balance sheet date that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition to our critical accounting policies below, see Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The Company enters into short-term contracts for last-mile satellite and cargo delivery (transportation services), payload hosting and in-orbit servicing options with customers that are primarily in the aerospace industry. For its transportation service arrangements, the Company has a single performance obligation of delivering the customers payload to its designated orbit and recognizes revenue (along with any other fees that have been paid) at a point in time, upon satisfaction of this performance obligation. Additionally, for its in-orbit service arrangements, the Company provides a multitude of services consistently throughout the mission to its customers and has services available on a stand ready basis until the mission reaches its conclusion. The Company recognizes revenue for these in-orbit services ratably over time on a straight-line basis. The Company enters into contracts to perform services for U.S. Government customers. The Company recognizes revenue for these services in accordance with the terms of these contracts. 
 We account for customer contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which includes the following five-step model: 
 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer. 
 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract. 
 Determination of the transaction price. 
 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 
 Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. 
 The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. While the Company s standard contracts do not contain refund or recourse provisions that enable its customers to recover any non-refundable fees that have been paid, the Company may issue full or partial refunds, or concessions on future services to customers on a case-by-case basis as necessary to preserve and foster future business relationships and customer goodwill. 
 The Company s satellite and cargo delivery services (transportation services) are considered a single performance obligation, to transport the customers payload to a specified orbit in space. We recognize revenue for these services at a point in time, when control is transferred, which is considered to be upon the release of the customers payload into its specified orbit. We will calculate the weight distribution of each transfer vehicle at the customer level, and 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 we will estimate the delivery date for each customer s payload based on the relative weight of payloads released to determine the point in time to recognize revenue for each payload release. 
 The Company s in-orbit services consist of a collection of interdependent and integrated services which are not considered distinct from one another and may vary depending on the specific needs of the Customer and mission. Revenue for these in-orbit services is recognized ratably over time on a straight line basis. 
 The Company s engineering project services to U.S. Government organizations generally have specific payment attached to each milestone. When a milestone is achieved, the Company submits services performed for approval. Once approval is received, the Company invoices and collects on the milestone completed. 
 In periods in which we recognize revenue, we will disclose the amounts of revenue recognized that was included as a contract liability balance at the beginning of the reporting period in accordance with ASC 606-10-50-8(b). 
 Loss Contingencies 
 We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including product-related and other litigation. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Refer to Note 12. 
 Deferred Fulfillment and Prepaid Launch Costs 
 We prepay for certain launch costs to third-party providers that will carry the orbital service vehicle to orbit. Prepaid costs allocated to the delivery of a customer s payload are classified as deferred fulfillment costs and recognized as cost of revenue upon delivery of the customer s payload. Prepaid costs allocated to our payload are classified as prepaid launch costs and are amortized to research and development expense upon the release of our payload. The allocation is determined based on the distribution between customer and our payload weight on each launch. 
 Contract Liabilities 
 Customer deposits collected prior to the release of the customer s payload into its specified orbit are recorded as current and non-current contract liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as the amounts received represent a prepayment for the satisfaction of a future performance obligation that has not yet commenced. Each non-refundable deposit is determined to be a contract liability upon cash collection. Prior to making this determination, we ensure that a valid contract is in place that meets the definition of the existence of a contract in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-1 and 2. 
 Stock-based Compensation 
 We have various stock incentive plans under which incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock awards are granted to employees, directors, and consultants. All stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the consolidated interim financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values. 
 We recognize stock-based compensation expense using a fair value-based method for costs related to all stock-based payments. We estimate the fair value of stock-based payments on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The model requires management to make a number of assumptions, including expected volatility of our stock, expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. The fair value of the stock is expensed over the related service period which is typically the vesting period. The stock-based compensation expense that is reported in our consolidated interim financial statements is based on awards that are expected to vest. We account for forfeitures as they occur. 
 Estimating the fair value of equity awards as of the grant date using valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, is affected by assumptions regarding a number of variables as disclosed above, and any changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 Income Taxes 
 We account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed. 
 Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. 
 In the event that management changes its determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. 
 ASC Topic 740-10 requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any tax benefit can be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, classification and interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The amount that is ultimately sustained for an individual uncertain tax position or for all uncertain tax positions in the aggregate could differ from the amount that is initially recognized. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 
 Please refer to Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, the timing of their adoptions and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates, and inflation, as well as risks to the availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The market risk inherent in our financial instruments and our financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 0.8 million, which were primarily invested in highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less. However, due to the short-term maturities and the low-risk profile of our investments, an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 There were no material foreign currency transactions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Currently, a significant portion of our cash receipts and expenses are generated in U.S. dollars. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information that we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 48 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
