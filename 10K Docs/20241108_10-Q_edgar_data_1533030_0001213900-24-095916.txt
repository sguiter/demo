incur losses for the immediate future. The Company expects to finance future cash needs from the results of operations and additional
financing until the Company can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities. However, there can be no assurance

used of cash for operating activities, incurred a net loss of and has an accumulated deficit of since
inception. 

Our financial statements for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from

stock purchase warrants to CRYM Co-Invest that are exercisable up until February 8, 2029 and which include a cashless exercise option.
The total number of warrant shares issued was (each tranche for shares, exercisable at , , and ,
per share, respectively). The fair value of the Warrants was determined utilizing a Binomial model considering all relevant assumptions
at the dates of issuance, including the Company stock price ), term years), rounded annual volatility ), and risk-free rate ). The Company also included a sale and purchase commitment option feature where CRYM Co-Invest has agreed to direct its affiliates
to purchase up to five (5) units of the Company s equipment for each. Along with the sale and purchase commitment option,
if the Company identifies a suitable lessee to rent the equipment from the affiliate and enter into an equipment rental agreement, then
CRYM Co-Invest and the Company will each receive of a monthly processing fee for the term of the equipment rental. Lastly, the amended
agreement also includes a net revenue sharing commitment feature that begins after the first equipment purchase by the lender s
affiliate, whereby the Company will remit of the Company s quarterly net revenue that is generated through non-affiliated rental
and non-affiliated sales income. With respect to the measurement of the contingent liability for future net revenue royalty payments,
management has measured this based on the best estimate of the expected future liability as of September 30, 2024.

General Overview 

History 

Cryomass Technologies Inc Cryomass Technologies 
or the Company began as Auto Tool Technologies Inc., which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May
10, 2011. The Company s name was changed to AFC Building Technologies Inc. effective January 10, 2014. Effective April 26, 2018,
the Company changed its name to First Colombia Development Corp. On July 1, 2019, the Company acquired 100 of the membership interests
in General Extract, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company. The name of this subsidiary was subsequently changed to Cryomass LLC. Effective
October 14, 2019, the Company changed its name to Redwood Green Corp. Effective September 1, 2020, the Company changed its name to Andina
Gold Corp. On July 15, 2021, the Company changed its name to Cryomass Technologies Inc and subsequently changed its trading symbol to
CRYM. 

The Company s principal office is located
at 1001 Bannock St., Suite 612, Denver, CO 80204, and its telephone number is 303-416-7208. The Company s website is www.cryomass.com.
Information appearing on the website is not incorporated by reference into this report. 

20 

On June 22, 2021, the Company acquired patented
technology from CryoCann USA Corp Cryocann (including US patent #10,864,525) to harness liquid nitrogen to reduce biomass
and then efficiently isolate, collect and preserve delicate resin glands (trichomes) containing prized compounds like cannabinoids and
terpenes. Building on this technology, Cryomass has engineered its premier Trichome Separation unit (CryoSift Separator ), optimized
via patented cryogenic processes to rapidly capture intact, high-value cannabis and hemp trichomes (CryoSift ). Much like sugar
and flour refinements, the resulting CryoSift concentrate is a superior product compared to unprocessed biomass. For cultivators,
reducing biomass into CryoSift slashes volume up to 80 , dramatically lowering storage, handling, and transportation costs. Properly
stored, CryoSift prevents potency and terpene degradation, preserving value. For processors, the minimized input volume also enables
considerable cost savings and logistics advantages. Extracting from CryoSift using solvents and manufacturing solventless products
unlocks industrial scale yields unattainable otherwise. Cryomass anticipates its efficiencies will catalyze industry-wide shifts in cannabis
and hemp post-harvest methods. Additionally, the technology shows promise for diverse trichome-rich plants. 

Through an independent engineering and manufacturing
firm we refined the design of the CryoSift Separator for the handling of harvested hemp, cannabis and other premium crops. Our
first CryoSift Separator unit has been fully developed and was delivered to RubberRock Inc., a company in California as described
in the following section of this report. The Patent License and Equipment Rental Agreement with RubberRock was terminated by the Company
on July 22, 2024, due to RubberRock s non-compliance with material terms. 

Third party engineering and manufacturing firms
have indicated that they have the capacity to manufacture sufficient units to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. 

Canadian Patent no. 3 064 896
 Cryogenic Separation of Plant Material was filed on May 25, 2018 by two assignors, who assigned it, among other,
various other intellectual property rights, to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as part of the Cryocann June 22, 2021
transaction. The respective Canadian patent was granted on April 19, 2022. Provided that all patent maintenance fees are paid, the
Canadian patent no. 3 064 896 will expire on May 25, 2038. 

In September 2021, we were granted an additional
patent for our process from the Chinese Intellectual Property Office. On February 8, 2024, we were notified by the European Patent Office
of the intention to grant a European patent based on our application no. 18 730 941.4-1101. We currently are taking steps to gain further
protection for our intellectual property through the European Union Intellectual Property Office, European Patent Office and in several
other non-US jurisdictions. 

Our Current Business 

Our business portfolio includes the accounts of
Cryomass LLC, Cryomass California LLC and 1304740 BC ULC dba Cryomass Canada, which are 100 owned by Cryomass Technologies Inc. 

Cryomass Technologies Inc. develops and licenses
cutting-edge equipment and processes to refine harvested cannabis, hemp, and other premium crops. The Company s patented technology
harnesses liquid nitrogen to reduce biomass and then efficiently isolate, collect and preserve delicate resin glands (trichomes) containing
prized compounds like cannabinoids and terpenes. Building on this technology, Cryomass has engineered its premier Trichome Separation
unit (CryoSift Separator ), optimized via patented cryogenic processes to rapidly capture intact, high-value cannabis and hemp trichomes
(CryoSift ). Much like sugar and flour refinements, the resulting CryoSift concentrate is a superior product compared to
unprocessed biomass. For cultivators, reducing biomass into CryoSift slashes volume up to 80 , dramatically lowering storage, handling,
and transportation costs. Properly stored, CryoSift prevents potency and terpene degradation, preserving value. For processors,
the minimized input volume also enables considerable cost savings and logistics advantages. Extracting from CryoSift using solvents
and manufacturing solventless products unlocks industrial scale yields unattainable otherwise. Cryomass anticipates its efficiencies will
catalyze industry-wide shifts in cannabis and hemp post-harvest methods. Additionally, the technology shows promise for diverse trichome-rich
plants. 

Because the trichomes collected with Cryomass technology
represent only 10 to 20 of a plant s volume, they are cheaper to ship and store than gross plant material. For the same reason
and because trichomes are free of the waxes and other unwanted materials found in the rest of the plant, processing trichomes into oils
and extracts can be far quicker, cheaper and easier than processing gross plant material. Even trichomes captured from dried
or frozen plant parts deliver this cost-saving advantage to processors of oils and extracts. The three-dimensional advantage achievable
with the CryoSift Separator first-stage cost savings, product enhancement and downstream cost savings can
significantly increase a crop s wholesale value. 

21 

Production and processing of hemp and cannabis
is a huge, worldwide industry. In the U.S., for example, the wholesale value of the cannabis crop from just the 11 states permitting adult-use
and medical cannabis exceeds 6 billion annually. Growth in the U.S. and in the worldwide market is likely fed in part by the growing
acceptance of medicinal cannabis products and anticipated legislative changes in various jurisdictions worldwide. 

Several other high-value plants, including species
that are important for health and wellness products, wrap their valuable elements in trichomes. The technology we are developing for hemp
and cannabis may have profitable application to those other species as well. 

In January 2023, we signed a license and lease
arrangement with RedTape Core Partners LLC RedTape to deploy multiple Cryomass trichome separation units at the prospective
partner s facility in California and other locations, which was amended August 16, 2023. No funds were ever paid by RedTape to Cryomass
pursuant to the lease and license agreement, and the agreement was terminated on December 20, 2023. 

On August 18, 2023, the Company entered into a
Patent License and Equipment Rental Agreement with RubberRock, Inc. RubberRock for a term of five years, in which the
Company licenses its proprietary CryoSift Separator process and technology and leases one CryoSift Separator Unit for use
in the state of California. The agreement was subsequently amended on January 9, 2024 and again on February 28, 2024. Under the terms
of the transaction, RubberRock paid license fees of 100,000 payable and a monthly royalty based on 10 of revenues. Subsequent to the
commencement of the RubberRock agreement, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Noel, joined the board of directors of RubberRock at
the end of September 2023, which created a related party disclosure requirement. In January 2024, Christian Noel ceased to be on the board
of directors of RubberRock. On July 22, 2024, the Company gave notice to terminate its agreement with RubberRock, due to non-compliance
with material terms of the Patent License and Equipment Rental Agreement. 

On October 16, 2024, the Company obtained an order granted the Company s
application forWrit of Possession against RubberRock from the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda, to repossess the CryoSift
Separator and remove it from the RubberRock premises. 

On February
29, 2024, Cryomass entered into an Equipment Purchase And Sale Agreement wherein CRYM Co-Invest Unit #1 LLP CRYM1 ), a special
purpose vehicle created for the purpose, agreed to purchase one CryoSift Separator Unit for C 1.62 million. In turn, CRYM1 entered into
a lease agreement with Vmax Canna Solutions Inc of Ontario, Canada to lease the CryoSift Separator for three years with two one-year options.
To date, C 30,000 of the purchase price has been received from CRYM1. 

On May 9,
2024, Cryomass entered into an Equipment Purchase And Sale Agreement wherein CRYM Co-Invest Unit #2 LLP CRYM2 ), a special
purpose vehicle created for the purpose, agreed to purchase one CryoSift Separator Unit for 1.2 million. In turn, CRYM2 entered into
a lease agreement with a wholly-owned US subsidiary of Leef Brands Inc of Vancouver, Canada to lease the CryoSift Separator for three
years with one three-year options to renew. The purchase of this unit by CRYM1 has been paid in full. 

We believe that our technologies will deliver
a compelling combination of cost and time savings while enhancing product quality and quantity for largescale cultivators and processors
of hemp and cannabis. To that end, Cryomass is working with an extensive pipeline of cultivators and processors in various markets,
including several states in the USA, as well as Canada.

Revenues 

There were 5,000 and 0 in revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses encompass personnel costs,
general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and legal and professional fees. Total operating expenses
were 870,859 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,373,304 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
net decrease of 502,445 or 37 , is predominantly related to a decrease in general and administrative expense, personnel costs, and legal
and professional fees in 2024. The decrease in personnel costs of 313,728 or 52 is predominantly related to executive pay decreases
effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024, the termination of an employee, and ceased efforts to work with a SOX compliance consultant.
The decrease in general and administrative expense of 115,897 or 30 predominantly stems from the Company phasing out the use of RSU
grants as stock compensation in 2023. The decrease in legal and professional fees of 72,819, or 77 is predominantly related to a decrease
in recruiting expenses and investor relations expenses as the company has had reduced hiring and capital raise efforts in 2024. 

Other Expense 

Other expense for the three months ending September
30, 2024 consisted of 82,082 loss on contingent royalty liability, 147,504 interest expense net and 6,488 loss on foreign exchange.
Other expense for the three months ending September 30, 2023 consisted of 109,302 interest expense and 28,740 loss on foreign exchange.
The increase in loss on contingent royalty liability is a result of an updated forecast of expected royalties due affecting the current
fair value of the contingent royalty liability. The increase in interest expense was a result of the Company issuing promissory notes
to investors throughout 2023. The gain on foreign exchange predominantly relates to a payable agreement with Cryomass LLC s supplier
as well as notes denominated in CAD. 

Net Loss 

For the foregoing reasons, we had a net loss of
 1,101,933 for the three months ending September 30, 2024, or 0.00 net loss per common share basic and diluted, compared to a
net loss of 1,453,866 for the three months ending September 30, 2023, or 0.01 net loss per common share basic and diluted.

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses encompass personnel costs,
research and development, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, loss on impairment of goodwill,
and legal and professional fees. Total operating expenses were 3,038,395 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to
 9,179,576 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease of 6,141,181 or 67 , was primarily attributable to a decrease
in intangible asset impairment charges, general and administrative, personnel costs, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company
fully impaired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets due to delays in implementing our business model, resulting in a 4,843,043
impairment charge for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in personnel costs of 599,844 or 25 is predominantly related
to executive pay decreases effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024, the termination of an employee, and ceased efforts to work
with a SOX compliance consultant. The decrease in general and administrative expense of 381,506 or 35 predominantly stems from the Company
phasing out the use of RSU grants as stock compensation in 2023. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 208,508 or
70 results from the Company writing off all of its acquisition-related intangible assets in the second quarter of 2023. 

Other Expense 

Other expense for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 consisted
of 338,897 loss on extinguishment of debt, 455,924 interest expense net, 19,980 gain on foreign exchange and a 1,487,082 loss
on contingent royalty liability. Other expense for the nine months ending September 30, 2023 consisted of 245,566 interest expense and
 10,944 gain on foreign exchange. The increase in loss on extinguishment of debt relates to the Company cancelling its debt with two debt
holders in exchange for common shares and warrants. The increase in interest expense was a result of the Company entering into new promissory
note agreements during the second quarter of 2023. The gain on foreign exchange predominantly relates to a payable agreement with Cryomass
LLC s supplier as well as notes denominated in CAD. 

Net Loss 

For the foregoing reasons, we had a net loss of 5,276,129 for the
nine months ending September 30, 2024, or 0.02 net loss per common share basic and diluted, compared to a net loss of 9,414,198
for the nine months ending September 30, 2023, or 0.0 net loss per common share basic and diluted. 

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows 

The Company believes that its available cash balance
as of the date of this filing will not be sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations for at least the next twelve months.
The Company believes that, at the present time, its ability to continue operations depends on cash expected to be available from lease
payments and royalty payments in connection with future revenue generation, as well as possible debt, equity or other investment sources,
to fund its anticipated level of operations for at least the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working deficit
of 6,946,821 and cash balance of 183,439. The Company estimates that it needs approximately 3,600,000 to cover
overhead costs and capital expenditure requirements ranging up to 2,700,000 based on the current pipeline of customer activity. The Company
believes that the Company will continue to incur losses for the immediate future. The Company expects to finance future cash needs from
the results of operations and additional financing until the Company can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating
activities. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise that we
will be able to attract the necessary financing. 

Going Concern 

The Company believes that there is substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

None. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to intangibles, accounting
for acquisitions, warrants, income taxes, useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuations.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not applicable for a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have carried out an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. Based upon that evaluation, our Company s CEO and CFO concluded that our Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Management has not formally documented its procedures
and controls and as such does not have a sufficient basis to assess its internal controls over financial reporting. Management identified
that it did not maintain adequately designed internal control over the preparation and oversight of: 

month-end and period-end financial close processes. 

non-routine or complex transactions. 

the adoption of new accounting standards. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this
report and according to the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. 

Based on that evaluation, management has concluded
that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, due
to the existence of significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting described below. 

26 

A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness is
a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. 

Management identified the following material weakness
during the year ended December 31, 2023: 

Management did not timely detect impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as of June 30, 2023, in accordance with GAAP. 

Management remediated the above material weakness
through designing processes to timely detect impairment and operating those processes as designed in an effective manner. Further, there
is no longer a material risk of detecting goodwill impairment, as the total balance was written off in 2023. 

Management has determined that we did not maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, due to the existence of the following
significant deficiencies identified by management: 

Due to the Company s size, there is insufficient segregation of duties to prevent or detect on a timely basis a misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. 

Information technology controls are ineffective or lacking, An IT strategic plan and general controls related to access, change management, segregation of duties, contingency planning, information security, business applications, and interfaces are not yet adequately implemented, updated and monitored. 

A top-down risk assessment has not yet been performed and documented by management to identify, analyze, and assess risks related to operations, external financial and non-financial reporting, internal reporting, compliance, fraud or other changes that could significantly impact the internal control environment. 

Internal controls and related activities that could mitigate financial statement risks within key business processes have either not been established or are not fully adequate, documented, and/or maintained. Also, various regulatory compliance issues currently exist at an entity-level related to the control environment component specific to non-performance and/or insufficient/incomplete performance, document maintenance, review and approval, and the enforcement of individual accountability. 

Documented accounting and other standard rules, guidelines, policies and procedures for key functions within the organization (HR, Payroll, Finance, Sales, IT, etc) have either not been established, are not complete, and/or are not consistently being utilized and monitored against control activities for compliance and ICFR effectiveness. 

27 

A whistle-blower program has not yet been established for the anonymous reporting, appropriate tracking, investigating, monitoring, and resolving of alleged wrongdoing, personnel complaints and grievances, without retribution. 

Recurring, formalized employee communication and training on internal controls and the company s commitment to ICFR has not yet been established. Additionally, a permanent, independent internal audit solution has not yet been established to perform an ongoing evaluation of the company s key controls and ICFR, continuous monitoring of corrective actions, and regular reporting of internal control deficiencies and overall effectiveness of the company s internal control environment. 

We intend to continue to evaluate and strengthen
our internal control over financial reporting. These efforts require significant time and resources. If we are unable to establish adequate
internal control over financial reporting, we may encounter difficulties in the audit or review of our financial statements by our independent
registered public accounting firm, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prepare financial statements in
accordance with GAAP and to comply with our SEC reporting obligations. 

Management engaged the services of an experienced
expert in internal controls until September 30, 2023 who evaluated our current system and began implementation of a more effective system
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act have been recorded, processed,
summarized and reported accurately. Our management intends to develop or improve procedures to address the current significant deficiencies
to the extent possible during the next twelve months. 

Management utilizes external experts to assist
the Company with technical accounting expertise needs as deemed necessary and has engaged a consultant to perform a formal assessment
and remediation of its internal control s framework. However, no assurance can be made at this point that the implementation of
such controls and procedures will be completed in a timely manner or that they will be adequate once implemented. 

Attestation report of Registered Public
Accounting Firm 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include
an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting because
we are not an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer . Our management s report was not subject
to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s
report in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Management s Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The Company maintains disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
executive officer (who is also the Company s principal executive officer), and our chief financial officer (who is also the
Company s principal financial and accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Thus, in
accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, which is the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on the
evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the significant deficiencies found in our internal controls
over financial reporting, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective. The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to significant deficiencies
identified in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

We have not been able to remediate the significant
deficiencies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. Our remediation efforts
will continue to be implemented throughout our 2024 fiscal year. We believe that the controls that we will be implementing will improve
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control
over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address the significant deficiencies or determine to supplement
or modify certain of the remediation measures described above.
