In addition, the unsecured personal loans originated through our marketplace are referred to as Borrower Loans, and the borrower payment dependent notes issued through our marketplace, whether issued by PMI or PFL, are referred to as Notes. Investors currently invest in Borrower Loans through two channels: (i) the Note Channel, which allows investors to purchase Notes from PFL, the payments of which are dependent on the payments made on the corresponding Borrower Loan; and (ii) the Whole Loan Channel, which allows accredited and institutional investors to purchase Borrower Loans in their entirety directly from PFL. The Notes available to Note Channel investors are distinguishable from notes held by certain third party investors pursuant to Prosper s securitization transactions, which are referred to herein as Notes Issued by Securitization Trust. Finally, although historically the Company has referred to investors as lender members, PFL calls them investors herein to avoid confusion since WebBank is the lender for Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace.

Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can generally be identified by the use of words such as may, believe, expect, project, estimate, intend, anticipate, plan, continue or similar expressions. These statements may appear throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled Business, Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, PFL or PMI expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of their respective managements, expressed in good faith and is believed to have a reasonable basis. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. 
 The following include some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated: 
 the performance of the Notes, which, in addition to being speculative investments, are special, limited obligations that are not guaranteed or insured; 
 PFL s ability to make payments on the Notes, including in the event that borrowers fail to make payments on the corresponding Borrower Loans; 
 our ability to attract potential borrowers and investors to our personal loan marketplace, and borrowers to our unsecured credit card Credit Card product, and secured digital home equity line of credit and home equity loan (together, the Home Equity Products 
 the reliability of the information about borrowers that is supplied by borrowers including actions by some borrowers to defraud investors; 
 our ability to service the Borrower Loans, and our ability or the ability of a third-party debt collector to pursue collection against any borrower, including in the event of fraud or identity theft; 
 credit risks posed by the credit worthiness of borrowers of our Personal Loan and Credit Card products and the effectiveness of our credit rating systems; 
 potential efforts by state regulators or litigants to impose liability that could affect PFL s (or any subsequent assignee s) ability to continue to charge to borrowers the interest rates that they agreed to pay at origination of their loans; 
 the impact of future economic conditions on the performance of the Notes and the loss rates for the Notes; 
 the growth and performance of the recently-launched Credit Card product and the Home Equity products; 
 our compliance with applicable local, state and federal law, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and other laws; 
 our compliance with applicable regulations and regulatory developments or court decisions affecting our business; 
 potential efforts by state regulators or litigants to characterize PFL or PMI, rather than WebBank, as the lender of the loans originated through our marketplace; 
 the application of federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws to borrowers and to PFL and PMI; 
 the impact of borrower delinquencies, defaults and prepayments on the returns on the Notes; 
 the impact of rising interest rates and inflation on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects; 
 the lack of a public trading market for the Notes and the current lack of any trading platform on which investors can resell the Notes; 
 the federal income tax treatment of an investment in the Notes and the PMI Management Rights; and 
 our ability to prevent security breaches, disruptions in service, and comparable events that could compromise the personal and confidential information held on our data systems, reduce the attractiveness of the platform or adversely impact our ability to service Borrower Loans.

There may be other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them does occur, what impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition. You should carefully read the factors described in the Risk Factors sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause our actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements. 
 All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law.

 Fair Value Valuation Method 
 Prosper uses a discounted cash flow valuation methodology generally consisting of developing an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of a financial instrument and then discounts those cash flows at a rate of return that results in the fair value amount. 
 Significant unobservable inputs presented in the table within Note 8 below are those that Prosper considers significant to the estimated fair values of the Level 3 Servicing Assets. The following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. 
 Market Servicing Rate 
 Prosper estimates adequate market servicing rates that would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required, which includes the profit that would be demanded in the marketplace. This rate is stated as a fixed percentage of outstanding principal balance on a per annum basis. With the assistance of a valuation specialist, Prosper estimates these market servicing rates based on observable market rates for other loan types in the industry and bids from subservicing providers,

 As PMI s Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, Notes, Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability, Servicing Assets and Liability, Credit Card Derivative, Credit Card servicing obligation liability and loan trailing fee liability do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, the Company uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Financial instruments are categorized in the Level 3 valuation hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. These fair value estimates may also include observable, actively quoted components derived from external sources. As a result, gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. Prosper did not transfer any assets or liabilities in or out of Level 3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be evaluated with care. The effect on fair value of a variation in assumptions generally cannot be determined because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the fair value may not be linear. Additionally, the impact of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value is calculated while holding other assumptions constant. In reality, changes in one factor may lead to changes in other factors, which could impact the above hypothetical effects.

 million Term Loan maturing on November 14, 2026. Proceeds received from the Term Loan were net of an original issue discount and the Company also incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs. Both the original issue discount and the debt issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the Term Loan to interest expense using the effective interest method. On June 26, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement Amendment which temporarily decreases the minimum thresholds for tangible net worth and asset coverage ratio that the Company is required to maintain under the Credit Agreement, in exchange for certain fees payable in installments. The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by

per annum. In addition, all borrowings under the Term Loan accrue payment-in-kind PIK interest at per annum. Any accrued PIK interest that remains unpaid at the end of each month is added to the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan. 
 Guarantees and Collateral 
 PMI s obligations under the Term Loan are guaranteed by PHL and BillGuard. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority, perfected lien on substantially all of the assets of PMI (subject to exclusions such as certain cash amounts and deposit accounts), PHL and BillGuard, as well as equity interests in all of PMI s subsidiaries with the exception of PGT. 
 Covenants and Other Matters 
 The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions and thresholds, restrict PMI s ability to incur certain new indebtedness; incur certain liens; sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets; make loans, advances, and guarantees; and pay dividends or make other distributions on equity interests. 
 In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants with which the Company must remain in compliance as of the last business day of each month during the life of the Term Loan: 
 a minimum tangible net worth 
 a minimum net liquidity 
 a maximum leverage ratio 
 a minimum asset coverage ratio 
 The Company is in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024, as well as applicable monthly periods for the quarter then ended. On June 26, 2024, the Company signed Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, which reduced the minimum tangible net worth for the months of June through December 2024, and the minimum asset coverage ratio for the month of July 2024. In exchange for the temporary reduction in the minimum tangible net worth, the Company is paying an additional fee of thousand in six equal installments from June through November 2024, and will be required to pay an additional thousand in any month the tangible net worth falls below the previous minimum tangible net worth for the period of June through December 2024 (up to a total of thousand). 
 The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants, and certain reporting obligations. In addition, the Term Loan lender will be permitted to accelerate all outstanding borrowings and exercise other specified remedies upon the occurrence of certain events of default (subject to certain grace periods and exceptions), which include, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, certain cross-defaults to other indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, certain judgments and changes of control. 
 Prosper Warehouse Trust Agreements 
 Prosper consolidated two warehouse VIEs, PWIT and PWIIT (together, the Warehouse VIEs ), that each entered into an agreement (together, the Warehouse Agreements with certain lenders for committed revolving lines of credit Warehouse Lines during 2018 and 2019, respectively. In connection with the Warehouse Agreements, the Warehouse VIEs each entered into a security agreement with a bank as administrative agent and a national banking association as collateral trustee and paying agent. Proceeds under the Warehouse Lines could only be used to purchase certain unsecured consumer loans and related rights and documents from Prosper and to pay fees and expenses related to the Warehouse Lines. Both Warehouse VIEs were consolidated because Prosper was the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. The assets of the VIEs could be used only to settle obligations of the VIEs. Additionally, the creditors of the Warehouse Lines had no recourse to the general credit of Prosper. The loans held in the Warehouse VIEs were included in Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value and Warehouse Lines were in Warehouse Lines in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

million. The PWIT Warehouse Agreement was subsequently amended in June 2018, June 2019, May 2021 and May 2023, the cumulative impact of which was to increase the committed line of credit to million between two classes of loans with two separate lenders, adjust the interest rate and unused commitment fee, expand the eligibility criteria for unsecured consumer loans that could be financed through the PWIT Warehouse Line, reduce the advance rate and extend the term of the Warehouse Agreement. 
 In conjunction with the PMIT 2024-1 securitization (see Note 7, Securitizations ), the entire portfolio of Loans Held for Sale in the PWIT Warehouse Line, with an unpaid principal balance of million as of March 28, 2024, was transferred to either the PMIT 2024-1 Transaction or PFL, as follows: million of those Borrower Loans were contributed into the securitization trust through a depositor, and the remaining million consisted of loans ineligible for securitization and were transferred to PFL through an equity contribution. Proceeds from the sale of these loans were used to pay down the outstanding principal and interest on the PWIT Warehouse Line of million, and the PWIT Warehouse line was terminated a t that time. Remaining proceeds, net of transaction expenses, following the securitization transaction were transferred to PMI. As a result of the termination of the PWIT Warehouse Line, deferred and unamortized debt issuance costs of million were immediately amortized into interest expense. 
 Prosper maintained a swaption to limit the Company's exposure to increases in SOFR on up to million of borrowings under the PWIT Warehouse Line. The swaption was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in Prepaids and Other Assets. Any changes in the fair value were recorded in the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The swaption was terminated on March 28, 2024 upon repayment and termination of the PWIT Warehouse Line in conjunction with the PMIT 2024-1 securitization. The change in fair value of the swaption was and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
 PWIIT Warehouse Line 
 On March 28, 2019, through PWIIT, Prosper entered into a second Warehouse Agreement for a million Warehouse Line with a national banking association different than that of PWIT. The PWIIT Warehouse Agreement was subsequently amended in May 2021, May 2023 and July 2023, the cumulative impact of which was to break the committed line of credit into two classes of loans with two separate lenders, adjust the interest rate and extend the term of the Warehouse Agreement. In conjunction with the PMIT 2023-1 securitization (see Note 7, Securitizations ), the entire portfolio of Loans Held for Sale in the PWIIT Warehouse Line was transferred to either the PMIT 2023-1 securitization or PFL. Proceeds from the sale of these loans were used to pay down the outstanding principal and interest on the PWIIT Warehouse Line, and it was terminated at that time.

 Dividends 
 Dividends on shares of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E-1, Series E-2, Series F and Series G convertible preferred stock are payable only when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors. No dividends will be paid with respect to the common stock until any declared dividends on the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E-1, Series E-2, Series F, and Series G convertible preferred stock have been paid or set aside for payment to the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E-1, Series E-2, Series F, and Series G convertible preferred stockholders. After payment of any such dividends, any additional dividends or distributions will be distributed among all holders of common stock and preferred stock in proportion to the number of shares of common stock that would be held by each such holder if all shares of preferred stock were converted to common stock at the then-effective conversion rate. The Series A-1 convertible preferred shares have no dividend rights. To date, no dividends have been declared on any of PMI s preferred stock or common stock. 
 Conversion 
 Under the terms of PMI s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the holders of preferred stock have the right to convert such preferred stock into common stock at any time. In addition, all preferred stock automatically converts into common stock (i) immediately prior to the closing of an initial public offering that values Prosper at least at billion and that results in aggregate proceeds to Prosper of at least million or (ii) upon a written request from the holders of at least of the voting power of the outstanding preferred stock (on an as-converted basis), provided that (i) the Series A-1 convertible preferred stock shall not be converted without at least of the voting power of the outstanding Series A-1 convertible preferred stock; (ii) the Series D shall not be converted without at least of the voting power of the outstanding Series D; (iii) the Series E-1 and Series E-2 shall not be converted without at least of the voting power of the outstanding Series E-1 and Series E-2, voting together as a single class; (iv) the Series F shall not be converted without at least of the voting power of the outstanding Series F, and (v) the shares of Series G Preferred Stock will not be automatically converted unless the holders of at least of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock approve such conversion. In addition, if a holder of the Series A convertible preferred stock has converted any of the Series A convertible preferred stock, then all of such holder s shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock also will be converted upon a liquidation event (as defined under the certificate of incorporation). In lieu of any fractional shares of common stock to which a holder would otherwise be entitled, PMI shall pay such holder cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of such fractional shares, as determined by its Board of Directors. At present, each of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E-1, Series E-2, and Series F convertible preferred stock converts into PMI common stock at a :1 ratio. The Series A-1 convertible preferred stock converts into common stock at a :1 ratio and the Series G convertible preferred stock converts into common stock at a 1: ratio. The Series G convertible preferred stock conversion ratio reflects the Series G true-up that occurred at end of the vesting period for the Series E-2 and Series F Preferred Stock warrants.

shares of Series E-1 convertible preferred stock. The Second Series E-1 Warrant for an additional shares of Series E-1 convertible preferred stock was granted on the signing of the Consortium Purchase Agreement (as described in Note 13 of PMI s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023) on February 27, 2017. The Series E-1 warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire from the date of issuance. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Prosper recognize d million and million of expense, respectively, from the re-measurement of the fair value of the warrants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Prosper recognized million and million of expense, respectively, from the re-measurement of the fair value of the warrants. The expense resulting from the remeasurement of the fair value of the warrants is recorded in Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 To determine the fair value of the Series E-1 Warrants, the Company first determined the value of a share of Series E-1 Convertible Preferred Stock. To determine the fair value of the Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company first derived the business enterprise value BEV of the Company using a variety of valuation methods, including discounted cash flow models and market based methods, as deemed appropriate under the circumstances applicable at the valuation date. Once the Company determined an estimated BEV, the option pricing method OPM was used to allocate the BEV to the various classes of our equity, including our preferred stock. The concluded per share value for the Series E-1 Convertible Preferred Stock was utilized as an input to the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 Risk-free interest rate Expected term (in years) Dividend yield 
 The above assumptions were determined as follows: 
 Volatility: The volatility is derived from historical volatilities of several unrelated publicly listed peer companies over a period approximately equal to the term of the warrant as the Company has limited information on the volatility of its preferred stock since there is currently no trading history. When making the selections of industry peer companies to be used in the volatility calculation, the Company considered the size, operational, and economic similarities to the Company s principal business operations. 
 Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect as of September 30, 2024, and for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the term of the warrant. 
 Expected Term: The expected term is the period of time for which the warrants are expected to be outstanding. 
 Dividend Yield: The expected dividend assumption is based on the Company s current expectations about the Company s anticipated dividend policy.

 In connection with the Consortium Purchase Agreement on February 27, 2017, PMI issued warrants to purchase up to shares of PMI's Series F convertible preferred stock at per share. The warrants expire from the date of issuance. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Prosper recogniz ed million and million of expense, respectively, from the re-measurement of the fair value of the warrants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Prosper recognized million and million of expense, respectively, from the re-measurement of the fair value of the warrants. The expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the warrant is recorded through Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 Common Stock 
 PMI, through its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, is the sole issuer of common stock and related options, RSUs and warrants. On February 16, 2016, PMI amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation to, among other things, effect a -for-1 forward stock split. On September 20, 2017, PMI further amended its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance. The total number of shares of stock which PMI has the authority to issue is , consisting of shares of common stock, par value per share, and shares of preferred stock, par value per share. As described above, the Company repurchased shares of Common Stock on December 23, 201 9. As of September 30, 2024, shares of common stock were issued and shares of common stock were outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, shares of common stock were issued and shares of common stock were outstanding. Each holder of common stock is entitled to vote for each share of common stock held.

 Other Information Regarding Stock Options 
 The weighted-average remaining contractual term for options outstanding as of September 30, 2024 i s years . 
 The fair value of options granted to employees is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This valuation model for stock-based compensation expense requires PMI to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the fair value of PMI s common stock, the expected term (the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the volatility of PMI s common stock, a risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Given the absence of a publicly traded market, the Company considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of PMI s common stock at each grant date. These factors included, but were not limited to: (i) contemporaneous valuations of common stock performed by unrelated third-party specialists, (ii) the prices for PMI s preferred stock sold to outside investors, (iii) the rights, preferences and privileges of PMI s preferred stock relative to PMI s common stock, (iv) the lack of marketability of PMI s common stock, (v) developments in the business, (vi) secondary transactions of PMI s common and preferred shares, and (vii) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a merger or acquisition of Prosper, given prevailing market conditions. As PMI s stock is not publicly traded, volatility for stock options is based on an average of the historical volatilities of the common stock of several entities with characteristics similar to those of PMI. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual lives of the options using the simplified method. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. PMI uses an expected dividend yield of as it does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 PMI also estimates forfeitures of unvested stock options. Expected forfeitures are based on the Company s historical experience. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from the estimates, the difference will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. compensation cost is recorded for options that do not vest.

 thousand of income tax expense and thousand of income tax benefit, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, PMI recognized and thousand and thousand of income tax expense, respectively. The income tax expense relates to state incom e tax expense and the amortization of tax deductible goodwill which gives rise to an indefinite-lived deferred tax liability. No other income tax expense or benefit was recorded for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to a full valuation allowance recorded against the Company s deferred tax assets . 
 Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize our existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore a full valuation allowance has been recorded.

through February 1, 2027, Prosper is required to pay WebBank an amount equal to such deficiency. Accordingly, t he minimum fe e is million for the remaining nine months of 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026 and million in 2027. 
 Additionally, under the Origination and Sale Agreements, Prosper is required to maintain a minimum net liquidity of million at all times during the term of the agreement. Net liquidity is defined as the sum of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Available for Sale Investments. Violation of this covenant can result in termination of the contract with WebBank. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company was in compliance with the covenant. 
 Transaction Fee Refund Liability 
 The Company has accrued million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to anticipated future refunds under its Transaction Fee refund liability with WebBank. 
 Loan Purchase Commitments 
 Prosper entered into an agreement with WebBank to purchase million of Borrower Loans that WebBank originated during the last two business days of the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Prosper will purchase these Borrower Loans within the first two business days of the quarter ending December 31, 2024. 
 Repurchase Obligation 
 Under the terms of the loan purchase agreements between Prosper and investors that participate in the Whole Loan Channel, Prosper may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to repurchase a Borrower Loan from an investor. Generally, these circumstances include the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, the failure to properly follow personal loan listing or bidding protocols or a violation of the applicable federal, state or local lending laws. Prosper recognizes a liability at fair value for the repurchase obligation when the Borrower Loans are sold. The fair value of the repurchase obligation is estimated based on historical experience. Repurchased Borrower Loans associated with violations of federal, state or local lending laws or verifiable identity theft are written off at the time of repurchase. The maximum potential amount of future payments associated with this obligation is the outstanding balances of the Borrower Loans issued to third parties through the Whole Loan Channel, which at September 30, 2024 is billion. Prosper has accrued million a nd million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in regard to this obligation. 
 Under the terms of the indenture and investor registration agreement, Prosper may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to either repurchase a Note or indemnify the investor for any losses resulting from nonpayment of a Note purchased in the Retail Channel. The decision to repurchase or indemnify is in Prosper s sole discretion. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, a technical error in the automated bidding tools which results in the purchase of a Note that does not match the investor s investment criteria, or situations in which a personal loan listing includes a Prosper Rating that is different from the Prosper Rating that should have appeared in the listing for the corresponding Borrower Loan because either PFL inaccu rately input data into, or inaccurately applied, the formula for determining the Prosper Rating and, as a result, the interest of the investor is materially and adversely affected. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased million of Notes under these circumstances, and has agreed to indemnify additional Notes with an unpaid principal balance of million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Regulatory Contingencies 
 Prosper accrues for contingencies when a loss from such contingencies is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss is probable and if it is possible to quantify the amount of the estimated loss, Prosper reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters on at least a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If Prosper determines that an unfavorable outcome is not probable or that the amount of a loss cannot be reasonably estimated, Prosper does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. If an unfavorable outcome is probable and Prosper can estimate a range of outcomes, an amount is recorded which management considers to be the best estimate within the range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if management cannot quantify the amount of the estimated loss, then the low end of the range of the potential losses is recorded.

 Fair Value Valuation Method 
 PFL uses a discounted cash flow valuation methodology generally consisting of developing an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of a financial instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a rate of return that results in the fair value amount. 
 Significant unobservable inputs presented in the table within Note 7 are those that PFL considers significant to the estimated fair values of the Level 3 Servicing Assets. The following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. 
 Market Servicing Rate 
 PFL estimates adequate market servicing rates that would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required, which includes the profit that would be demanded in the marketplace. This rate is stated as a fixed percentage of outstanding principal balance on a per annum basis. With the assistance of a valuation specialist, PFL estimates these market servicing rates based on observable market rates for other loan types in the industry and bids from sub-servicing providers, adjusted for the unique loan attributes that are present in the specific loans that PFL sells and services and information from backup service providers. 
 Discount Rate 
 The discount rate is a rate of return used to discount future expected cash flows to arrive at a present value, which represents the fair value of the loan servicing rights. Management used a range of discount rates for the Servicing Assets based on comparable observed valuations of similar assets and publicly available disclosures related to servicing valuations, with comparability adjustments made to account for differences with PFL s Servicing Assets. 
 Default Rate 
 The default rate presented in Note 7 is an annualized, average estimate considering all Borrower Loan categories (i.e., risk ratings and duration), and represents an aggregate of conditional default rate curves for each credit grade or Borrower Loan category. Each point on a particular Borrower Loan category s curve represents the percentage of principal expected to default per period based on the term and age of the underlying Borrower Loans. The assumption regarding defaults directly reduces servicing revenues because the amount of servicing revenues received is based on the amount collected each period. 
 Prepayment Rate 
 The prepayment rate presented in Note 7 is an annualized, average estimate considering all Borrower Loan categories (i.e., risk ratings and duration), and represents an aggregate of conditional prepayment rate curves for each credit grade or Borrower Loan category. Each point on a particular Borrower Loan category s curve represents the percentage of principal expected to prepay per period based on the term and age of the underlying Borrower Loans. Prepayments reduce servicing revenues as they shorten the period over which PFL expects to collect fees on the Borrower Loans, which is used to project future servicing revenues.

 Loan Trailing Fee Liability 
 The fair value of the Loan Trailing Fee Liability (included in Other Liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets) represents the present value of the expected monthly Loan Trailing Fee payments, which takes into consideration certain assumptions related to expected prepayment rates and default rates using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used are the same as those used for the valuation of Servicing Assets, as described below.

 through February 1, 2027, Prosper is required to pay WebBank an amount equal to such deficiency. Accordingly, the minimum fee is million for the remaining nine months of 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026 and million in 2027. 
 Additionally, under the Origination and Sale Agreements, Prosper is required to maintain a minimum net liquidity of million at all times during the term of the agreement. Net liquidity is defined as the sum of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Available for Sale Investments. Violation of this covenant can result in termination of the contract with WebBank. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company was in compliance with the covenant. 
 Transaction Fee Refund Liability 
 PFL has accrued million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to anticipated future refunds under its Transaction Fee refund liability with WebBank. 
 Loan Purchase Commitments 
 Under the terms of PFL s agreement with WebBank, PFL is committed to purchase million of Borrower Loans that WebBank originated during the last two business days of the quarter ended September 30, 2024. PFL will purchase these Borrower Loans within the first three business days of the quarter ending December 31, 2024.

billion. PFL has acc rued million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in regard to this obligation. 
 Under the terms of the indenture and investor registration agreement, Prosper may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to either repurchase a Note or indemnify the investor for any losses resulting from nonpayment of a Note purchased in the Retail Channel. The decision to repurchase or indemnify is in Prosper s sole discretion. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, a technical error in the automated bidding tools which results in the purchase of a Note that does not match the investor s investment criteria, or situations in which a personal loan listing includes a Prosper Rating that is different from the Prosper Rating that should have appeared in the listing for the corresponding Borrower Loan because either PFL inaccurately input data into, or inaccurately applied, the formula for determining the Prosper Rating and, as a result, the interest of the investor is materially and adversely affected . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company repurchased million of Notes under these circumstances, and has agreed to indemnify additional Notes with an unpaid principal balance of million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Regulatory Contingencies 
 PFL accrues for contingencies when a loss from such contingencies is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss is probable and if it is possible to quantify the amount of the estimated loss, PFL reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters on at least a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If PFL determines that an unfavorable outcome is not probable or that the amount of a loss cannot be reasonably estimated, PFL does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. If an unfavorable outcome is probable and PFL can estimate a range of outcomes, PFL records the amount management considers to be the best estimate within the range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if management cannot quantify the amount of the estimated loss, then PFL records the low end of the range of those potential losses. 
 West Virginia Matter 
 In February 2020, Prosper received a proposed Assurance of Discontinuance (an AOD from the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia (the WV Attorney General requesting that, without in any way admitting that any of its prior practices were in violation of the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act (the Consumer Act ), Prosper agree to certain terms and conditions regarding its past and potential future conduct of its business with respect to customers in West Virginia, including a release by the WV Attorney General of any claims it may have related to the matters identified in the AOD. 
 We cannot predict the outcome of the matter and any potential fines or penalties, if any, that may arise from the matter. Further, we are unable to estimate a range of outcomes and as a result no accrual has been made. 
 No loans have been originated through the Prosper platform to West Virginians since June 2016 and the final loan originated through the Prosper platform to a borrower in West Virginia was repaid in October 2021.

 PROSPER MARKETPLACE, INC. 
 Overview 
 Our vision is to transform lives by providing affordable financial solutions through the simplest and most trusted platform. We currently offer access to three lending products, each of which supports our vision: (i) unsecured personal loans through a personal loan marketplace which connects eligible consumer borrowers with individual and institutional investors, (ii) a Credit Card product available to eligible borrowers, and (iii) Home Equity products available to eligible homeowners. 
 We believe our personal loan business model has key advantages relative to traditional banks, including (i) an innovative marketplace model that efficiently connects qualified supply and demand of capital, (ii) online operations that substantially reduce the need for physical infrastructure and improve convenience, and (iii) use of advanced technology and artificial intelligence to deliver simple, fast, personalized, and transparent solutions that can improve consumers financial health as they move across the credit spectrum. We do not operate physical branches or incur expenses related to infrastructure like traditional banks or consumer finance institutions. As part of operating our marketplace, we verify the identity of borrowers and assess borrowers credit risk profile using a combination of public and proprietary data. Our proprietary technology automates several loan origination and servicing functions, including the borrower application process, data gathering, underwriting, credit scoring, loan funding, investing and servicing, regulatory compliance and fraud detection. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, our marketplace facilitated 2.2 billion in Borrower Loan originations, of which 1.9 billion were funded through our Whole Loan Channel, representing 89 of the total Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace during this period. From inception through September 30, 2024, our marketplace has facilitated 27.3 billion in Borrower Loan originations, of whic h 24.5 billion were funded through our Whole Loan Channel, representi ng 90 o f the total Borrow er Loans originated through our marketplace during this period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our marketplace facilitated 579.4 million in Borrower Loan originations, an increase of 17 from the same period in 2023. The percentage of loans funded through the Whole Loan Channel for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 92 . 
 As a company that operates a credit marketplace, and offers Credit Card and Home Equity products, we believe our customers are highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends, real or perceived, in the markets driven by, among other factors, general economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These external economic conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could adversely impact our customers ability or desire to participate on our marketplace as borrowers or investors and, consequently, could negatively affect our business and results of operations.

 Personal Loan Originations 
 From inception of the Company through September 30, 2024, a total o f 2,166,738 Borrower Loans, totaling 27.3 billion were originated through our marketplace. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , 37,085 Borrower Loans totaling 579.4 million were originated through Prosper s marketpla ce, compared t o 36,097 Borrower Loans totaling 493.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This represents a unit increase of 3 and a dollar increase of 17 . The originations increase for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 versus the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increased third-party investor demand given the improved macroeconomic environment and decrease in interest rates in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Personal loan origination volume by Prosper Rating was as follows for the periods presented (in millions, except percentages): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amount Amount Amount Amount AA 97.8 17 68.5 14 202.8 12 249.1 14 A 101.7 18 62.6 13 262.4 16 229.4 13 B 124.7 21 139.7 28 349.0 22 456.3 27 C 62.0 11 70.1 14 167.9 10 253.6 15 D 47.0 8 51.9 11 157.2 10 187.0 11 E 68.8 12 66.6 13 227.3 14 202.1 12 HR 3.6 1 13.1 1 13.3 1 Other (1)

 (1) Represents personal loans funded through the Prosper platform via the Whole Loan Channel but not assigned Prosper Ratings. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, the total and mix of personal loan originations on the Prosper platform reflects increased demand for personal loans not assigned Prosper ratings, which are sold only to institutional investors and are based on specific underwriting criteria and custom risk models developed by those investors.

Personal Loan Serviced Portfolio and Whole Loans Outstanding 
 Our personal loan serviced portfolio consists of all Borrower Loans that we service both through the Note and Whole Loan Channels. Borrower Loans funded through the Whole Loan Channels include loans that we hold in consolidated trusts, as well as those sold to third parties. Our personal loan serviced portfolio decreased 0.2 million, or 5 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. This decrease is primarily due to decreased year-over-year originations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as a reduction in personal loans purchased through our two consolidated warehouse trusts, which we terminated in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, respectively. 
 
 The outstanding balance of Borrower Loans sold through our Whole Loan Channel serves as a primary driver of our Servicing Assets. Whole loans outstanding decreased 0.2 million, or 5 , from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to the same factors that drove the decrease in the personal loan serviced portfolio, above. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 See the section titled Results of Operations below, for the discussion on significant changes in Net Income (Loss) year-over-year. 
 Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 The following table summarizes our net income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except percentage): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Total Net Revenues 52,204 33,200 19,004 57 Total Expenses 90,688 64,307 26,381 41 Net Loss Before Taxes (38,484) (31,107) (7,377) n/m Income Tax (Expense) Benefit (26) 64 (90) (141) Net Loss (38,510) (31,043) (7,467) n/m

 n/m: not meaningful 
 Total Net Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 19.0 million as c ompared to the same period in 2023. The increase was largely attributa ble to a 26.8 million increase in Transaction Fees, Net, due to a revised WebBank transaction fee schedule starting in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well the higher personal loan origination volume during this time, as discussed above. Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments contributed a 2.8 million increase to total Net Revenues, primarily due to an increase in the fair value of our consolidated warehouse and securitization loans due to lower interest rates and reduced delinquencies and charge-offs, partially offset by reduced fair value gains and increased charge-offs within our Credit Card portfolio. These increases were partially offset by the Loss on Sale of Borrower Loans, which increased 9.6 million year-o ver-year, primarily as a result of additional incentives provided to whole loan investors incentives during that time. Finally, there was a 1.0 million decrease in Total Interest Income (Expense), Net, due primarily to a decrease in the average outstanding principal balance of loans held in consolidated warehouse and securitization trusts. 
 
 Total Expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 26.4 million as compared to the same period in 2023, p rimarily due to the Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants, which is in turn driven by changes in the fair value of th e underlying Convertible Preferred Stock. Specifically, the loss for the three months ended 
 71 

September 30, 2024 totals 42.3 million, which compares to a loss of 16.7 million for the corresponding period in 2023, a change of 25.6 million. Additionally, there is a combined 0.8 million increase in Origination and Servicing expenses, Sales and Marketing expenses and General and Administrative expenses, as costs increased in response to higher personal loan originations. Accordingly, the net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7.5 million when compared to the net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Total Net Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 20.8 million as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was largely attributable to a 45.6 million incr ease in Transaction Fees, Net, due to a revised WebBank transaction fee schedule starting in the fourth quarter of 2023, with some offsetting impact from the lower personal loan origination volume during this time, as shown above. Additionally, total Net Revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Net increased 7.6 million year-over-year, due primarily to more favorable fair value adjustments resulting from lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced fair value gains and increased charge-offs within our Credit Card portfolio. Finally, there was a 1.1 million increase in Serv icing Fees, Net, due primarily to changes in the fair value of the credit card servicing obligation resulting from a change in estimate applied in the first quarter of 2024 related to the discount rate applied to the cash flows associated with that obligation, partially offset by a decrease in servicing revenue. These increases were partially of fset by a 25.2 million decrease from L oss on Sale of Borrower Loans, due primarily to additional incentives provided to whole loan investors during this time. There was als o a 9.0 million decrease in Tot al Interest Income (Expense), Net, due primarily to a decrease in the average outstanding principal balance of loans held in consolidated warehouse and securitization trusts. 
 
 Total Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decrease d 55.5 million as compared to the same period in 2023, primaril y due to the Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants, which is in turn driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock. Specifically, the loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totals 3.9 million, which compares to a loss of 44.4 million for the corresponding period in 2023, a change of 40.5 million. Additionally, there is a combined 14.6 million decrease in Origination and Servicing expenses, Sales and Marketing expenses and General and Administrative expenses, as costs decreased in response to lower personal loan originations. Accordingly, the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 76.2 million when compared to the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Transaction Fees, Net 
 We earn a transaction fee upon the successful origination of all Borrower Loans facilitated through our marketplace. Prosper receives payments from WebBank as compensation for the activities we perform on behalf of WebBank. Our fee is determined by the term and credit grade of the Borrower Loans that we facilitate on our marketplace and WebBank originates. We record the transaction fee revenue net of any fees paid by us to WebBank. 
 We also earn various program fees from our Credit Card product, such as interchange fees, annual fees and late fees, and broker fees from our Home Equity product. These program and broker fees are recorded within Transaction Fees, Net. 
 Transaction Fees, Net increased 26.8 million, or 93 , for th e three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is primarily due to revisions to the WebBank transaction fee schedule starting in October 2023, which were then further modified in June 2024. Under the revised WebBank transaction fee schedule, transaction fees now range from 1.0 to 9.99 , depending on the term and credit grade of the Borrower Loan, as compared to 1.0 to 5.0 under the previous schedule prior to October 2023. Transaction fees above 5.0 are refundable on a pro-rated basis upon the full prepayment of the related Borrower Loan prior to maturity under Utah law, where WebBank is domiciled, and thus the impact of these increased transaction fees is reduced by expected refunds. In addition to the impact from this change in the transaction fee schedule, the increased personal loan origination volume during the third quarter of 2024 discussed above, drove a portion of the increase in Transaction Fees, Net. There was also a positive impact from continued growth in our Credit Card product, as we recognized approximately 6.4 million in program fees under our Credit Card product for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 5.2 million for the corresponding period of 2023, an increase of 1.2 million. 
 Transaction Fee s, Net increased 45.6 million, or 49 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is generally due to the revised WebBank transaction fee schedule described above, partially offset by the estimated refund liability. The impact from this change in the transaction fee schedule was partially offset by the lower personal loan origination volume during the first nine months of 2024, compared to the corresponding period of 2023, as shown above. There was also a positive impact from continued growth in our Credit Card product, as we recognized approximately 17.8 million in program fees under our Credit Card product for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 12.8 million for the corresponding period of 2023, an increase of 5.0 million. 
 Servicing Fees, Net 
 Investors who purchase Borrower Loans through the Whole Loan Channel typically pay us a servicing fee which is generally set at 1.0 per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the Borrower Loan prior to applying the current payment, plus an additional 0.075 per annum to cover the Loan Trailing Fee. The Servicing Fee compensates us for the costs incurred in servicing the Borrower Loan, including managing payments from borrowers, payments to investors and maintaining investors account portfolios. We record Servicing Fees from investors as a component of operating revenues when received. We also include any collection fees received, net of collection agency expenses, in Servicing Fees. 
 73 

In addition, we are contractually obligated to service the entire portfolio under our Credit Card product. Our banking partner, Coastal Community Bank Coastal ), pays us a servicing fee of 1.0 per annum of the daily outstanding principal balance of all cards designated as Coastal allocations. These allocations represented approximately 10 of the portfolio through March 31, 2024, but were reduced to 5 starting April 1, 2024 as a result of an amendment to the Program Agreement executed in March 2024. To the extent these contractual fees are less than the market servicing rate that would be required by a market participant to service the entire portfolio, a servicing obligation is recorded. Changes to this servicing obligation are included in Servicing Fees, Net. 
 The decrease of 0.4 million, or 9 , in S ervicing Fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is primarily due to a 0.8 million combined decrease in servicing revenue and debt sale, loan trailing and collections fees, generally due to the decrease in the balance of whole loans outstanding during this period, as discussed above. This was partially offset by a 0.4 million increase from changes in the fair value of the credit card servicing obligation. That obligation will generally increase in line with the underlying Credit Card portfolio, and the percentage growth in that portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower relative to the same period in 2023 . 
 The increase of 1.1 million, or 9 , in Servicing Fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 is primarily due to a 2.5 million increase from changes in the fair value of the credit card servicing obligation. A change in estimate effective March 31, 2024, related to the application of a revised discount rate to this servicing obligation resulted in a decrease in the related liability of approximately 2.3 million as of September 30, 2024, thus increasing Servicing Fees by the same amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This increase was partially offset by a 1.6 million combined decrease in personal loan servicing revenue and debt sale, loan trailing and collections fees, generally due to the decrease in the balance of whole loans outstanding during this period, as discussed above .

 Loss on Sale of Borrower Loans consists of incentives provided at the time Borrower Loans are sold through the Whole Loan Channel, net of any gains recognized on those sales, primarily related to the recognition of additional Servicing Assets. Since 2022, due to market volatility and incentives offered by competitors, we started providing additional incentives to our investors. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, these incentives increased 10.3 million and 26.5 million, respectively, from the corresponding periods in the prior year. Excluding the impact of these incentives, the remaining changes in Loss on Sale of Borrower Loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, were an increased gain of 0.7 million and 1.3 million, respectively, primarily due to the recognition of additional Servicing Assets upon the sale of whole loans, as well as a decrease in the adequate compensation assumption used to value the Servicing Assets from 64.8 bps to 63.3 bps, starting in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other Revenues consists primarily of credit referral fees. Credit referral fees are earned from partner companies for the referral of customers on our platform, and accounted for the majority of the 0.4 million and 0.5 million increase in Other Revenues for the three and nine months ende d September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Interest Income on Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale and Interest Expense on Financial Instruments 
 We recognize Interest Income on Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale using the accrual method based on the stated interest rate to the extent we believe it to be collectible. We record interest expense on the corresponding fractional Notes, at Fair Value, Notes Issued by Securitization Trust and Warehouse Lines based on the contractual interest rates. The interest rate on fractional Notes, at Fair Value is generally 1 lower than the interest rate on the corresponding Borrower Loans to compensate us for servicing the underlying Borrower Loans. 
 The decrease of 1.0 million, or 24 , in Total Interest Income (Expense), Net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is primarily due to a combined 2.1 million decrease in Total Interest Income (Expense), Net generated from: (i) Loans Held for Sale, net of interest expense incurred on the Warehouse Lines, and (ii) securitized Borrower Loans, net of interest expense incurred on Notes Issued by Securitization Trust, during this period. This decrease is reflective of the reduced average outstanding balance of loans held in these consolidated trusts year-over-year, as well as the related decrease in the associated liabilities. We also incurred 0.6 million in securitization setup cost amortization related to the PMIT 2023-1 and PMIT 2024-1 securitizations established in September 2023 and March 2024, respectively. Additionally, interest income generated from Borrower Loans we purchased following the PMIT 2023-1 securitization decreased 0.4 million during this time, which is reflective of the reduced average outstanding balance of these loans. These decreases were partially offset by the 1.9 million in accelerated debt issuance costs recorded upon the termination 
 74 

of the PWIIT Warehouse Line in the third quarter of 2023, as well as the 0.3 million in debt issuance cost amortization in that period related to both the PWIT and PWIIT Warehouse Lines. 
 The decrease of 9.0 million, or 47 , in Total Interest Income (Expense), Net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is primarily due to a combined 8.0 million decrease in Total Interest Income (Expense), Net generated from: (i) Loans Held for Sale, net of interest expense incurred on the Warehouse Lines, and (ii) securitized Borrower Loans, net of interest expense incurred on Notes Issued by Securitization Trust, during this period. This decrease is reflective of the reduced average outstanding balance of loans held in these consolidated trusts year-over-year, as well as the related decrease in the associated liabilities. We also incurre d 2.1 million in securitization setup cost amortization related to the PMIT 2023-1 and PMIT 2024-1 securitizations established in September 2023 and March 2024, respectively. Additionally, interest income generated primarily from Borrower Loans we purchased following the PMIT 2023-1 securitization decreased 0.6 million during this time, which is reflective of the reduced average outstanding balance of these loans. These decreases were partially offset by the 1.9 million in accelerated debt issuance costs recorded upon the termination of the PWIIT Warehouse Line in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 We record Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, Notes and the Credit Card Derivative at fair value. Changes in the fair value of Borrower Loans funded through the Note Channel are largely offset by the changes in fair value of the Notes due to their borrower payment-dependent structure. Our obligation to pay principal and interest on Notes is equal to the loan payments, if any, that are received on the corresponding Borrower Loan, net of the servicing fee, which is generally 1.0 of the outstanding balance. 
 We used Warehouse Lines to finance the purchase of Loans Held for Sale for the purpose of earning Net Interest Income and contributing to securitization transactions. Loans Held for Sale consisted primarily of loans held in warehouse trusts. Changes in the fair value of Loans Held for Sale were not offset by changes in the fair value of Warehouse Lines because Warehouse Lines were carried at amortized cost. As discussed below and in Note 11 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we terminated our two existing Warehouse Lines in September 2023 and March 2024, respectively, and securitized the related Loans Held for Sale. Because of this, these loans are now classified as Borrower Loans on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 In September 2023 and March 2024, we sponsored and consolidated two securitization transactions, PMIT 2023-1 and PMIT 2024-1, respectively, with loans that were previously funded through our PWIIT and PWIT Warehouse Lines, respectively. Refer also to Note 7, Securitization , of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on these securitization transacti ons. We expect that changes in the fair value of Borrower Loans held by PMIT 2023-1 and PMIT 2024-1 will be negative due to delinquencies and ch arge-offs, but they could ultimately be negative or positive due to changes in fair value assumptions, such as expected credit performance, prepayment rates and implied market discount rates. Additionally, the impact from fair value adjustments on these securitized Borrower Loans may lessen as they season and the outstanding principal balances decrease. Notes issued by PMIT 2023-1 and PMIT 2024-1 are carried at amortized cost on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet, and thus do not impact the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 
 We earn interest income on loans held in securitization trusts during the period we own or consolidate the loans, which partially offsets changes in the fair value of these loans. The following tables illustrate the weighted-average composition of the loans held in consolidated securitization trusts by Prosper Rating for the periods presented, which is an indicator of their credit quality: 
 75 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Borrower Loans - Securitization (1) : 
 AA 24 A 27 B 23 C 13 D 6 E 6 HR 1 Total 100 (1) The percentages are calculated using the weighted-average of month-end principal balances of Borrower Loans by Prosper Rating. 
 
 Fair values of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The key assumptions used include default and prepayment rates derived primarily from historical performance, and discount rates based on estimates of the rates of return that market investors would require w hen investing in other financial instruments with similar characteristics. 
 The Credi t Card Derivative is recorded at fair value and is primarily reflective of discounted future cash flows from certain features of our Credit Card program that were determined to meet the definition of freestanding derivatives, including interest income, program fees paid to our banking partner Coastal and credit losses, net of recoveries. These cash flows are estimated based upon a set of valuation assumptions, including default and prepayment rates derived primarily from comparable companies and our own historical performance, and discount rates based on estimates of the rates of return that investors would require when investing in other financial instruments with similar characteristics. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments was a ga in of 0.2 million and a loss of 2.5 million, res pectively. The increase in the gain for this period was largely driven by the impact of securitized Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale, due to lower discount rates and the overall decrease in the average balance of loans held in consolidated warehouse and securitization trusts year-over-year, as these loans continue to season. For securitized Borrower Loans, the loss from changes in fair value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.7 million, due to a 2.1 million gain from fair value adjustments and 6.8 million in net charge-offs. This compares to securitized Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale in the corresponding period in 2023, when there was a combined loss from changes in fair value of 12.4 million, due primarily to a 3.2 million loss from fair value adjustments and 9.3 million in net charge-offs. 
 These decreased losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were partially offset by reduced gains on the Credit Card Derivative, due primarily to increased charge-offs and estimated loss rates. Fair value changes related to future cash flows underlying the Credit Card Derivative resulted in a gain of 6.4 million, and the net impact of realized transactions resulted in a loss of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to the corresponding period in the prior year, when fair value changes related to projected future cash flows underlying the Credit Card Derivative resulted in a gain of 8.5 million, and the net impact of realized transactions resulted in a gain of 0.8 million. 
 The net impact to the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments for fractional Borrower Loans and Notes (as well as the population of whole loans that are owned directly by PFL) was a 1.3 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , due to the borrower payment-dependent structure described above, offset by certain timing factors related to the receipt of borrower payments. During the same period in 2023, the net impact from these fractional Borrower Loans and Notes (as well as the population of whole loans that are owned directly by PFL) was a 0.6 million gain. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments was a los s of 11.5 million and a loss of 19.1 million, respectively. The decrease in the loss for this period was largely driven by the impact of securitized Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale, due to lower discount rates and the overall decrease in the average balance of loans held in consolidated warehouse and securitization trusts year-over-year, as these loans continue to season. For securitized Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale, the combined loss from changes in fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.2 million, due to 6.2 million in gains from fair value adjustments and 23.4 million in net charge-offs. For the corresponding period in 2023, the loss from changes in value was a combined 36.1 million, due to 13.3 million in losses from fair value adjustments and 22.8 million in net charge-offs. 
 76 

We also held a swap tion to limit our exposure to fluctuations in SOFR due to our PWIT Warehouse Line, which consisted of two classes of loans that bore interest at SOFR plus a defined spread (see Note 11 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further information). This swaption was terminated on March 28, 2024, upon the repayment of our PWIT Warehouse Line in conjunction with the PMIT 2024-1 securitization. The change in fair value of the swaption was immaterial for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a loss of 0.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023, resulting in a 0.5 million increase in revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments during this time. The overall decrease in the value of the swaption year-over-year, prior to its termination, is largely driven by an increase in the strike price of the swaption in 2023. 
 Fair value changes related to future cash flows underlying the Credit Card Derivative resulted in a gain of 13.2 million, and the net impact of realized transactions resulted in a loss of 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . This compares to the corresponding period in the prior year, when fair value changes related to projected future cash flows underlying the Credit Card Derivative resulted in a gain of 17.3 million, and the net impact of realized transactions resulted in a loss of 0.3 million. This decrease in net gains recognized on changes in the fair value of the Credit Card Derivative is primarily reflective of increased charge-offs and estimated loss rates, partially offset by the impact of a change in estimate effective as of March 31, 2024. Specifically, that change in estimate related to the application of a single discount rate to all components of the Credit Card Derivative starting in 2024 and resulted in a fair value increase of approximately 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 For fractional Borrower Loans and Notes (as well as the population of whole loans that are owned directly by PFL), the net impact to the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments was a 1.8 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the borrower payment-dependent structure described above, offset by certain timing factors related to the receipt of borrower payments. During the same period of 2023, the net impact from these fractional Borrower Loans and Notes was a 0.5 million gain. 
 The following table details the changes in fair value of our financial instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively (in thousands, except percentages): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Assets: Borrower Loans (11,149) (11,174) (35,502) (29,233) Loans Held for Sale (10,947) (2,263) (34,538) Credit Card Derivative (includes gains and losses from settled transactions) 6,178 9,273 7,453 17,013 SOFR rate swaption (included in Prepaid and Other Assets) 89 37 (456) Liabilities: Notes 5,202 10,214 18,767 28,109 Total 231 (2,545) (11,508) (19,105)

 The following table reflects full-time employees as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 by functional area:

 Origination and Servicing 
 Origination and Servicing costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to our capital markets, collections, customer support and payment processing employees and vendor costs associated with facilitating and servicing personal loans and our Credit Card product. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.7 million, or 15 , as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 is primarily due to a 1.9 million increase in third-party servicing costs associated with our Credit Card product, due to the continued growth of the underlying portfolio. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was an immaterial increase in Origination and Servicing costs as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This is primarily reflective of a 4.7 million increase in third-party servicing costs associated with our Credit Card product, due to the continued growth of the underlying portfolio, and a 0.4 million increase in depreciation due to the increase in the balance of internal-use software during this time. These are partially offset by a 3.1 million decrease in personal loan servicing and origination costs, both internal and outsourced, consistent with the decrease in personal loan originations discussed above. Additionally, compensation costs decreased 1.9 million, driven primarily by decreased headcount and the elimination of the corporate bonus accrual for the 2023 calendar year. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 78 

Sales and Marketing costs consist primarily of affiliate marketing, search engine marketing, online and offline campaigns, email marketing, public relations and direct mail marketing, as well as compensation expenses such as wages, benefits and stock-based compensation for the employees who support these activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase of 0.3 million, or 2 , from the corresponding period in the prior year is due primarily to an increase in marketing partnership costs of 0.5 million, which is generally in line with the increase in personal loan originations during this time, as discussed above. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease of 3.0 million, or 7 , from the corresponding period in the prior year is due to an overall reduction in marketing and advertising costs, which is generally in line with the decrease in personal loan originations during this time. This includes decreases in marketing partnership costs of 1.2 million and a combined decrease of 2.4 million across digital and email advertising spend. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.8 million increase in direct mail costs. Additionally, compensation expense decreased 0.2 million, driven primarily by the elimination of the corporate bonus accrual for the 2023 calendar year. 
 General and Administrative - Research and Development 
 General and Administrative - Research and Development costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to our engineering and product development employees, as well as related vendor costs. The decrease in General and Administrative Research and Development for the three months ended September 30, 2024, of 0.4 million, or 9 , from the corresponding period in the prior year is primarily due to a 1.0 million decrease in costs related to outsourced services, and a 0.2 million decrease in compensation costs, driven by decreased headcount. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease of 0.7 million from capitalized internal-use software and web development costs (increasing the expense). Specifically, these capitalized costs were 3.7 million and 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The decrease in General and Administrative Research and Development for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 4.9 million, or 31 , from the corresponding period in the prior year is primarily due to a 2.3 million decrease in compensation costs, driven by decreased headcount and the elimination of the corporate bonus accrual for the 2023 calendar year, and a 3.0 million decrease in costs related to outsourced services. These were partially offset by an increase in various software and subscriptions costs of 0.3 million. Finally, there was an increase of 0.1 million from capitalized internal-use software and web development costs (reducing the expense). Specifically, these capitalized costs were 11.0 million and 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 General and Administrative - Other 
 General and Administrative - Other expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to our accounting, finance, risk, legal, compliance, human resources and facilities employees, professional fees related to legal and account ing and facilities expenses. The decrease in General and Administrative - Other for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.8 million from the corresponding period in the prior year is due primarily to a 0.3 million decrease in compensation expense, driven primarily by decreased headcount, and a 0.3 million decrease in various professional services costs, including accounting, tax and legal services. 
 The decrease in General and Administrative - Other for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 6.7 million from the corresponding period in the prior year is due primarily to a 6.0 million decrease in compensation expense, driven primarily by decreased headcount and the elimination of the corporate bonus accrual for the 2023 calendar year. Additionally, various professional services costs, including accounting, tax and legal, contributed to a 0.7 million decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. 
 Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants 
 Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants is a loss of 42.3 million and a loss of 3.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to an increase in the fair value of the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock for those periods. Changes in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants was a loss of 16.7 million and a loss of 44.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to an increase in fair value of the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock for those periods. 
 79 

Interest Expense on Term Loan 
 We incurred interest costs of 3.4 million and 9.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 3.2 million and 9.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to our Term Loan. Refer to Note 11 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the Term Loan, including details of the interest rates. Interest costs related to the Term Loan should generally continue to increase each period as the amount of unpaid payment-in-kind interest accrues, though it will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. 
 We allocated 0.2 million in Term Loan interest costs to Net Interest Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the related Term Loan proceeds were used to purchase Loans Held for Sale through our Warehouse Lines. No such amount was allocated for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other Income, Net was 1.0 million and 2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and primarily consists of interest income on cash and cash equivalents, sublease income and other miscellaneous items. The 0.2 million and 1.1 million increases in Other Income, Net, for the three months and nine ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, are primarily attributable to increases in interest income driven by rising average interest rates throughout most of the first nine months of 2024. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted Net Revenue 
 Adjusted Net Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as our Total Net Revenue adjusted to exclude the impact of interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts and certain infrequent or unusual transactions such as the accelerated amortization of PWIT and PWIIT debt issuance costs. As a result of the termination of the PWIT Warehouse Line in March 2024 and the PWIIT Warehouse Line in September 2023 (see Note 11, Debt ), we accelerated the remaining amortization of the related deferred debt issuance costs into interest expense. We exclude the impact of this accelerated amortization because it is non-cash and because of the infrequent nature of the transaction. Management does not believe that it is reflective of our ongoing operating results. We believe it is useful to investors to exclude the impact of interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts to gain insight into the performance of our consolidated loans, independent of market factors that are beyond management s control. 
 Adjusted Net Revenue has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for Total Net Revenue, which has been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These limitations include the following: 
 Adjusted Net Revenue excludes the impact of interest rates, which may influence the price that a willing buyer would be willing to pay for our personal loans in a hypothetical arm s length transaction; and 
 Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted Net Revenue differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted Net Revenue alongside other financial performance measures, including Total Net Revenue and our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of Total Net Revenue to Adjusted Net Revenue for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):

 (2) Component of Interest Expense on Financial Instruments on the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as Net Income (Loss) adjusted for interest income on Cash and Cash Equivalents, Interest Expense on Term Loan, Income Tax Benefit or Expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets and Goodwill, stock-based compensation expense, Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants, impact of interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts, and certain infrequent or unusual transactions. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a helpful indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other things, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, to evaluate our operations and financial performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide investors insight into the manner in which management views the performance of the Company, enhance investors evaluation of our operating results, and to facilitate meaningful comparisons of our results between periods. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the GAAP financial information provided herein. 
 Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based charges; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest and tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and 
 Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 The major non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them, are outlined below: 
 Changes in the fair value of convertible preferred stock warrants liability : We exclude these fair value changes primarily because they are non-cash items and the fair value varies based on the fair value of the underlying preferred stock, varying valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. Their inclusion makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to evaluate. 
 Stock-based compensation expense : This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to evaluate; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation. We also excluded these expenses because they are non-cash. 
 Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill : We incur amortization or impairment of acquired Intangible Assets and Goodwill in connection with acquisitions and therefore exclude these 
 81 

amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets: We incur losses on the impairment of long-lived assets that are disposed in connection with the exit of facilities. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results. 
 Impact of interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts : See discussion on Adjusted Net Revenue, above. 
 Accelerated amortization of PWIT and PWIIT debt issuance costs : See discussion on Adjusted Net Revenue, above. 
 Interest expense on Term Loan : We incur interest expense on the Term Loan we closed in November 2022, which is more fully described in Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Proceeds from the Term Loan are used to fund the operations of the business at our discretion, within certain limitations. This may include, but is not limited to, making investments in our Credit Card product, investing in loans held in our warehouse facilities or meeting operational obligations. We exclude the Term Loan interest expense not associated with proceeds used to invest in loans held in our warehouse facilities from Adjusted EBITDA, as it is based on the overall financing structure of PMI. This differs from Interest Expense on Financial Instruments (part of Total Net Revenues), as the proceeds from those instruments are used exclusively for the purposes of purchasing loans on our marketplace.

 The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, is primarily reflective of increased transaction fees driven by the revised WebBank transaction fee schedule. Additionally, a change in estimate as of March 31, 2024, related to the valuation of the Credit Card Derivative and servicing obligation increased the value of our Credit Card Derivative by 7.2 million and reduced the value of our Credit Card servicing obligation by 2.3 million as of September 30, 2024, both of which directly impact Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase is also reflective of the increase in personal loan originations during this time, as discussed above. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase is also reflective of a reduction in expenses in response to decreased personal loan originations and the elimination of the 2023 corporate bonus accrual. These increases were partially offset by increased incentives provided to whole loan investors, as described above.

 Segment Adjusted EBITDA is our primary segment profitability metric, and is calculated as segment revenue less operating expenses that are directly attributable to the segments products. Segment Adjusted Net Revenue is calculated as segment revenue less the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts and certain unusual or infrequent transactions. For the periods presented above, these adjustments only impact the Personal Loan segment. 
 Personal Loan 
 For th e three months ended September 30, 2024, Personal Loan segment net revenues increased 20.5 million , or 99 , as compared to the correspondi ng period in 2023, primarily as a result of (a) a 25.6 million increase in Transaction Fees, Net, due to the revised WebBank transaction fee schedule starting in the fourth quarter of 2023 (further modified in June 2024), along with the impact from higher personal loan origination volume during this time; and (b) a 5.9 million increase in net revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments related to Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale, as described above. These increases were partially offset by (c) a 9.6 million decrease from Loss on Sale of Borrower Loans, due primarily to an increase in incentives provided to our investors during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023; (d) a 1.0 million decrease in Total Interest Income (Expense), Net, due primarily to the decrease in the average outstanding principal balance of loans held in consolidated warehouse and securitization trusts; and (e) a 0.7 million decrease in Servicing Fees, Net, due to the decrease in whole loans outstanding during this period, as discussed above. 
 For th e nine months ended September 30, 2024, Personal Loan segment net revenues increased 23.1 million, or 29 , as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily as a result of (a) a 40.7 million increase in Transaction Fees, Net, due to the revised WebBank transaction fee schedule starting in the fourth quarter of 2023 (further modified in June 2024), with some offsetting impact from the lower personal loan origination volume during this time; an d (b) a 17.2 million increase in net revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments related to Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale, as described above. These increases were partially offset by (c) a 25.2 million decrease from Loss on Sale of Borrower Loans, due primarily to an increase in incentives provided to our investors during the first half of 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023; (d) a 9.0 million decrease in Total Interest Income (Expense), Net, due primarily to the decrease in the average outstanding principal balance of loans held in consolidated warehouse and securitization trusts; and (e) a 0.9 million decrease in Servicing Fees, Net, due to the decrease in whole loans outstanding during this period, as discussed above. 
 84 

Seg ment Adjusted Net Revenue associated with the Personal Loan segment increased 16.0 million and 14.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 . This is reflective of the same factors that drove the increase in net revenues discussed above, excluding the impact of (a) interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts, and (b) accelerated recognition of debt issuance costs upon the termination of the PWIIT and PWIT Warehouse Lines in September 2023 and March 2024, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was a decrease in market interest rates, as compared to the overall increase in market interest rates for the nine month period then ended. In general, the volatile interest rate environment in the first nine months of 2023 resulted in a greater interest rate impact on the fair value of the loans during that period. 
 Adjusted EBITDA associated with the Personal Loan segment increased 14.5 million and 28.2 million f or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 . These increases are primarily reflective of the same factors that drove the increases in net revenues and Adjusted Net Revenue discussed above. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase is also reflective of a reduction in expenses year-over-year, including personnel, outsourced services and marketing costs, consistent with the decrease in personal loan originations during this time. 
 Home Equity 
 Home Equity segment net revenues and segment Adjusted Net Reven ue remained flat year-over-year. Home Equity segment net revenues consist of broker fees from our lending partners, and Adjusted EBITD A is reflective of these net revenues, offset by operating expenses. Home Equity segment operating expenses decreased 1.2 million a nd 3.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, as we reduced resources dedicated to the Home Equity segment. 
 Credit Card 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Credit Card segment net revenues and Segment Adjusted Net Revenues decreased 1.6 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily as a result of a 3.1 million decrease in Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments from our Credit Card Derivative. This includes a 2.2 million decrease from fair value adjustments, generally due to a lower portfolio growth rate and higher loss rate assumptions, and a 0.9 million decrease in revenue from realized transactions, primarily due to increased charge-offs within the portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by (a) a 1.2 million increase in Transaction Fees, Net, generally due to the overall growth in our Credit Card portfolio during this time; and (b) a 0.3 million increase in Servicing Fees, Net, driven by a smaller increase in our servicing obligation, which offsets revenue, in line with the lower portfolio growth rate. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Credit Card segment net revenues and Segment Adjusted Net Revenues decreased 2.4 million , as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily as a result of a 9.6 million decrease in Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments from our Credit Card Derivative. This includes a 4.0 million decrease from fair value adjustments, generally due to a lower portfolio growth rate and higher loss rate assumptions, and a 5.6 million decrease in revenue from realized transactions, primarily due to increased charge-offs within the portfolio . This decrease was partially offset by (a) a 4.9 million increase in Transaction Fees, Net, generally due to the overall growth in our Credit Card portfolio during this time; and (b) a 2.1 million increase in Servicing Fees, Net, driven by a smaller increase in our servicing obligation, which offsets revenue, in line with the lower portfolio growth rate. 
 Adjusted EBIT DA associated with the Credit Card segme nt decreased 2.0 million and 4.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, which is reflective of the decreases in net revenues and Segment Adjusted Net Revenues for these periods discussed above, as well as the impact of costs incurred as part of our continued investments in the Credit Card product s growth. Additionally, a change in estimate as of March 31, 2024, related to the valuation of the Credit Card Derivative and servicing obligation increased the value of our Credit Card Derivative by 7.2 million and reduced the value of our Credit Card servicing obligation by 2.3 million as of September 30, 2024, both of which directly impact the Credit Card segment net revenues, Segment Adjusted Net Revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We have incurred operating losses in prior periods and may continue to incur net losses in the future. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net income of 38.5 million and incurred a net loss of 31.0 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net income of 16.7 million and 
 85 

incurred a net loss of 92.9 million, respectively. Additionally, from our inception through September 30, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit of 606.8 million. 
 We believe our liquidity needs for the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future beyond that period, can be met through transaction fees, servicing fees, net interest income, other revenue, proceeds from sales of loans and securitizations, realized gains on the Credit Card Derivative and Cash and Cash Equivalents. For further details related to our Term Loan, see Note 11 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. In the second quarter of 2024, we decided to eliminate the corporate bonus and long-term incentive plan accrual for the 2023 calendar year, resulting in approximate cost savings of 6.0 million. Management monitors our financial results and operations. If the anticipated financial results are not achieved or we fail to maintain compliance with the debt covenants under our Term Loan, our sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to meet our operating and liquidity requirements without obtaining additional liquidity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.

 Income Taxes 
 We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying the statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Based on the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in prior years, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. 
 We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and 
 87 

are often ambiguous. We are required to make subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As a result of retaining servicing rights on the sale of Borrower Loans, we are an interest holder in certain special purpose entities that purchase these Borrower Loans. None of these special purpose entities are consolidated as we are not the primary beneficiary. Other than these special purpose entities, as of September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Certain of Prosper's accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in Prosper s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates during the first nine months of 2024, other than the following identified areas. 
 Valuation of Credit Card Derivative and Servicing Obligation 
 Effective March 31, 2024, we applied a single discount rate to all of the projected cash flows that comprise the Credit Card Derivative and Credit Card servicing obligation liability, in order to better align with how we believe a market participant would estimate the fair value of those cash flows. This single discount rate reflects the expected market rate of return from an investment in residual cash flows derived from a credit card portfolio. Previously, separate discount rates were applied to different cash flows reflecting assumptions around counterparty credit risk. The effect of this change in estimate increased the Credit Card Derivative by 7.3 million and reduced the Credit Card servicing obligation by 1.9 million as of March 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the value of our Credit Card Derivative is higher by 7.2 million and the value of our Credit Card servicing obligation is lower by 2.3 million, than if those balances were calculated using the old methodology. 
 Estimate of Transaction Fee Refund Liability 
 As discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the attached condensed consolidated financial statements, we assume WebBank s obligation under Utah law to refund the pro-rated amount of any transaction fees collected in excess of 5 , in the event the underlying borrower prepays the loan in full before maturity. Following revisions to the pricing schedule with WebBank in October 2023 and again in June 2024, we now charge transaction fees up to 9.99 for certain newly originated Borrower Loans, and accrue for future anticipated refunds at the time of origination. The key assumptions used in the estimate of this refund liability include default and prepayment rates derived primarily from relevant market data and historical performance, both of which require management judgment. The estimate is reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. We accrued 6.2 million and 1.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to anticipated future refunds under this obligation.

PROSPER FUNDING LLC 
 Overview 
 Prosper Funding LLC was formed in the state of Delaware in February 2012 as a limited liability company with PMI as its sole equity member. Prosper Funding was formed by PMI to hold Borrower Loans originated through the Note Channel and issue related Notes. Although Prosper Funding is consolidated with PMI for accounting and tax purposes, Prosper Funding has been organized and is operated in a manner that is intended to minimize the likelihood that it would be substantively consolidated with PMI in a bankruptcy proceeding. Prosper Funding s intention is to minimize the likelihood that its assets would be subject to claims by PMI s creditors if PMI were to file for bankruptcy, as well as to minimize the likelihood that Prosper Funding will become subject to bankruptcy proceedings directly. Prosper Funding seeks to achieve this by placing certain restrictions on its activities and by implementing certain formal procedures designed to expressly reinforce its status as a distinct corporate entity from PMI. 
 As a credit marketplace, we believe our customers are more highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends, real or perceived, in the markets driven by, among other factors, general economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These external economic conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could adversely impact our customers ability or desire to participate in our marketplace as borrowers or investors, and consequently could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 The following tables summarize Prosper Funding s net (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Total Net Revenues 14,180 17,092 (2,912) (17) Total Expenses 18,010 15,204 2,806 18 Net Loss (3,830) 1,888 (5,718) n/m

 n/m: not meaningful 
 
 Total net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.9 million, or 17 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in Loss on Sale of Borrower Loans, mainly as a result of additional incentives provided to whole loan investors incentives ). Additionally, because of a lower servicing book and lower outstanding principal balance of Borrower Loans and Notes, there was a resulting decrease in Servicing Fees, Net and Net Interest Income, respectively. Finally, there was a 1.9 million decrease in net revenues as a result of the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Net, primarily as a result of certain timing matters related to the receipt of borrower payments near quarter-end. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in administration fee revenue driven by an increase in reimbursements received from PMI for the incentives provided to whole loan investors. 
 Total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.8 million, or 18 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to a 2.8 million increase in administration fees resulting primarily from an increase in estimated transaction fee refunds following revisions to our pricing schedule with WebBank in October 2023 and June 2024. 
 Total net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6.5 million, or 13 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in Loss on Sale of Borrower Loans, mainly as a result of additional incentives provided to whole loan investors, combined with the impact from the decrease in the volume of whole loans sold due to lower personal loan originations. Because of a lower servicing book and lower outstanding principal balance 
 89 

of Borrower Loans and Notes, there was a resulting decrease in Servicing Fees, Net and Net Interest Income, respectively. Finally, the 2.2 million decrease in net revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to corresponding period of 2023, is primarily reflective of changes in the timing of the receipt of borrower payments near quarter-end. This also includes the impact of Borrower Loans ineligible for securitization transferred to PFL in conjunction with the PMIT 2024-1 Transaction, as discussed in Note 4, Borrower Loans and Notes, at Fair Value , of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in administration fee revenue driven by an increase in reimbursements received from PMI for the incentives provided to whole loan investors, which was partially offset by a decrease in loan listings generated on the marketplace. 
 Total expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.4 million, or 7 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to an increase in administrative fee expense during the period resulting from an increase in estimated transaction fee refunds following revisions to our pricing schedule with WebBank in October 2023 and June 2024, partially offset by a decrease in loans funded and servicing and nonsufficient funds fees collected (which are billed back by PMI) for the period.

Administration Fee Revenue - Related Party 
 We primarily generate revenues through license fees we earn under our Administration Agreement with PMI. The Administration Agreement contains a license we grant to PMI that entitles PMI to use the marketplace for, and in relation to: (i) PMI s performance of its duties and obligations under the Administration Agreement, and (ii) PMI s performance of its duties and obligations to WebBank under the Loan Account Program Agreement. The Administration Agreement requires PMI to pay us a monthly license fee that is partially based on the number of personal loan listings posted on the marketplace in that month, as well as a fee based on incentives provided to investors to incentivize the purchase of Borrower Loans from PFL. The increases in Administrative Fee Revenue of 10.4 million and 24.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, are primarily due to increased reimbursements received from PMI for incentives provided to whole loan investors, which resulted in increases of 10.3 million and 26.5 million in Administrative Fee Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a 1.8 million decrease from lower loan listings generated on our marketplace during this time. 
 Servicing Fees, Net 
 Investors who purchase Borrower Loans through the Whole Loan Channel typically pay us a servicing fee which is currently set at 1.0 per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the Borrower Loan prior to applying the current payment, plus an additional 0.075 per annum to cover the Loan Trailing Fee. The Servicing Fee compensates us for the costs incurred in servicing the Borrower Loan, including managing payments from borrowers, managing payments to investors and maintaining investors account portfolios. We record Servicing Fees from investors as a component of operating revenues when received. We also include any collection fees received, net of collection agency expenses, in Servicing Fees, Net. 
 The decreases in Servicing Fees, Net of 1.3 million and 2.1 million for t he three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresp onding periods in 2023, are largely due to the reduction in the servicing book during these periods, which resulted in decreased Servicing Fees, Net of 1.4 million and 2.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This is generally in line with the overall decrease in personal loan originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a combined 0.4 million increase in net collections and debt sale fees, as we continue to enhance our Borrower Loan recovery efforts. 
 Loss on Sale of Borrower Loans 
 Loss on Sale of Borrower Loans consists primarily of incentives provided to investors at the time Borrower Loans are sold through the Whole Loan Channe l, net of any gains recognized on those sales, primarily due to the recognition of additional Servicing Assets. Since 2022, due to market volatility and incentives offered by competitors, we started providing additional incentives to our whole loan investors. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, these incentives increased 10.3 million and 26.5 million, respectively, fro m the corresponding periods in the prior year, accounting for most of the increases for these periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of these increased incentives was partially offset by the impact of an increase in the volume of whole loans sold during this time, resulting from higher personal loan originations. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other Revenues has historically consisted primarily of incentive fees, which are earned from partner companies through our incentive programs. The changes in Other Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, were not significant. 
 Interest Income on Borrower Loans and Interest Expense on Notes 
 We recognize Interest Income on Borrower Loans using the accrual method based on the stated interest rate to the extent we believe it to be collectible. We record Interest Expense on the corresponding Notes based on the contractual interest rates. The interest rate on Notes is generally 1 lower than the interest rate on the corresponding Borrower Loans to compensate us for servicing the underlying Borrower Loans. 
 Overall, the 0.5 million and 0.8 million decreases in Net Interest Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, are due to a decrease in the outstanding principal balance of Borrower Loans and Notes during these periods. 
 91 

Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments captures gains (losses) in fair value estimates using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The key assumptions used in valuations include default and prepayment rates derived from historical performance and discount rates that reflect estimates of the rates of return that investors would require when investing in other financial instruments with similar characteristics. Changes in fair value of Borrower Loans funded through the Note Channel are largely offset by the changes in fair value of the corresponding Notes due to the borrower payment-dependent structure, though differences will arise due to the actual and projected impact of cash flows related to charge-offs, debt sales and miscellaneous fees, as well as certain timing differences. 
 The following table summarizes the fair value adjustments for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Borrower Loans (6,455) (9,594) (20,559) (27,653) Notes 5,202 10,214 18,768 28,109 Total (1,253) 620 (1,791) 456 
 The increased loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, was primarily due to the timing of borrower payments close to quarter-end, which were not yet applied against the related Notes. The decrease in net revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is reflective of the same timing difference described above, as well as the impact of Borrower Loans ineligible for securitization transferred to PFL in conjunction with the PMIT 2024-1 Transaction, as discussed in Note 4, Borrower Loans and Notes, at Fair Value , of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Other fair value changes are generally not material, which is consistent with the borrower payment-structure described above. 
 Expenses 
 The following table summarizes our expenses for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except percentages): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Expenses: Administration Fee - Related Party 16,264 13,493 2,771 21 Servicing and Other, Net 1,746 1,711 35 2 Total Expenses 18,010 15,204 2,806 18 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Expenses: Administration Fee - Related Party 46,896 43,336 3,560 8 Servicing and Other, Net 5,267 5,442 (175) (3) Total Expenses 52,163 48,778 3,385 7 
 Administration Fee - Related Party 
 Pursuant to our Administration Agreement with PMI, PMI manages the marketplace on our behalf. Accordingly, each month we are required to pay PMI (a) a corporate administration fee of 500,000 per month, (b) a fee for each Borrower Loan originated through the marketplace, (c) 62.5 of all Servicing Fees collected by us or on our behalf and (d) all nonsufficient funds fees collected by us or on our behalf. In general, the Administrative Fee Expense will not fluctuate directly in line with the Administrative Fee Revenue due to both the flat corporate administrative fee, as well as the fact that we pay fees for three different services, but receive a fee based only on the number of loans listed on the platform. We also include refund liabilities for transaction fees above 5 , based on our revised pricing schedule with WebBank, in Administration Fee - Related Party. 
 92 

The increase in Administration Fee - Related Party expense of 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year, is primarily reflective of a 2.9 million increase in the refund liability for transaction fees above 5 , as we only revised our pricing schedule with WebBank in the fourth quarter of 2023 and again in June 2024. 
 The increase in Administration Fee - Related Party expense of 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, is due primarily to a 7.1 million increase in the refund liability for transaction fees above 5 . This was partially offset by a decrease in administration fees of 3.5 million, due to decreases in the number of loans funded and Servicing Fees, Net and nonsufficient funds fees collected during this period. 
 Servicing and Other, Net 
 Servicing costs consist primarily of vendor and borrower costs, as well as depreciation of internal-use software associated with servicing Borrower Loans. Other items consist primarily of interest income on cash invested in our platform, as well as bank service charges and professional fees. The changes in Servicing and Other, Net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, were not significant. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net (Loss) Income (8,029) 1,838 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 8,211 (20,948) Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 1,526 (44,014) Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities (8,228) 38,387 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 1,509 (26,575) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at the beginning of the period 97,039 97,849 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at the end of the period 98,548 71,274 
 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash increased 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on the following components: 
 Operating Activities : 8.2 million was provided by operating activities, driven by cash provided by working capital of 9.5 million , primarily due to the timing of payments to PMI and investors, partially offset by net loss, net of non-cash adjustments of 1.3 million . 
 Investing Activities : 1.5 million was provided in investing activities, due to 149.0 million o f principal payments under Borrower Loans, partially offset by 142.1 million in purchases of Borrower Loans and 5.4 million in purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activiti es : 8.2 million was used by financing activities, due to 148.5 million in payments for Notes, at Fair Value, and partially offset by 140.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of Notes, at Fair Value. 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash decreased 26.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on the following components: 
 Operating Activities : Operating Activities: 20.9 million was used in operating activities, driven by cash used in working capital of 26.3 million, primarily due to the timing of payments to PMI and investors, partially offset by net income, net of non-cash adjustments of 5.3 million. 
 Investing Activities : 44.0 million was used in investing activities, due to 182.1 million in purchases of Borrower Loans and 4.7 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by 142.8 million of principal payments under Borrower Loans. 
 93 

Financing Activities : 38.4 million was provided by financing activities, due to 180.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of Notes, at Fair Value, partially offset by 141.6 million in payments for Notes, at Fair Value. 
 Income Taxes 
 We incurred no income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We are a US disregarded entity for income tax purposes and our income and loss is included in the return of our parent, PMI. Given PMI s history of taxable losses, it is difficult to accurately forecast how Prosper s and our results will be affected by the realization and use of net operating loss carry forwards. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As a result of retaining servicing rights on the sale of Borrower Loans, we are a variable interest holder in certain special purposes entities that purchase these Borrower Loans. None of these special interest entities are consolidated as we are not the primary beneficiary. Otherwise as of September 30, 2024, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing activities. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK 
 PROSPER MARKETPLACE, INC. 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values, or future cash flows that may result from changes in financial market prices and interest rates. 
 Through our securitization trusts (formed in September 2023 and March 2024) we hold Borrower Loans. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the market value of these Borrower Loans on our balance sheet. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations, or we may suffer a loss in principal if we are forced to sell Borrower Loans that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates, loss assumptions or overall market conditions. Interest rate increases may increase the risks of our investments in Borrower Loans through our securitization trusts, and additional fluctuations in interest rates may exacerbate such risks. Changes in the market value of Borrower Loans are recorded on the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of Borrower Loans held in consolidated securitization trusts was 219.1 million as of September 30, 2024 . 
 The fair values of Borrower Loans and Notes are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions such as default rate, prepayment rate and discount rate. Default rate, prepayment rate and discount rate may change due to expected loan performance or changes in the expected returns of similar financial instruments available in the market. We are exposed to the risk of a decrease in the fair value of loans held in the warehouse and securitization trusts. For Borrower Loans and Notes presented on our Balance Sheet on behalf of our Note Channel investors, the fair value adjustments for Borrower Loans are largely offset by the fair value adjustments of the Notes due to the borrower payment dependent design of the Notes and due to the total principal balances of the Borrower Loans being very close to the total principal balances of the Notes. 
 We had cash and cash equi valents of 29.2 million and 35.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts were held in various unrestricted deposits with highly rated financial institutions and short-term, highly liquid marketable securities which may include money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, and U.S. agency securities. Cash and Cash Equivalents are held for working capital purposes. Due to their short-term nature, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these liquid investments as a result of changes in interest rates. Decreases in short-term interest rates will moderately reduce interest income on these Cash and Cash Equivalents. Increases in short-term interest rates will moderately increase the interest income earned on the Cash and Cash Equivalents. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 As more fully described in Note 8, Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities, of Prosper's condensed consolidated financial statements attached to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the fair value of Borrower Loans is 517.1 million as of September 30, 2024, determined using a weighted-average discount rate of 7.13 . The combined fair value of Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale was 706.5 million as of December 31, 2023, determ ined using a weighted-average discount rate of 6.88 . A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximatel y 4.8 million and 6.8 million in the fair value of PMI s investment in Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 
 94 

2023, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of 4.9 million and 6.9 million in the fair value of our investment in Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Any realized or unrealized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate change would be recorded in our statement of operations so long as we hold these Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale on our balance sheet. 
 PROSPER FUNDING LLC 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values, or future cash flows that may result from changes in financial market prices and interest rates. 
 Because balances, interest rates, and maturities of Borrower Loans are matched and offset by an equal balance of Notes with the exact same interest rates (net of our servicing fee) and initial maturities, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the net fair value of the combined Borrower Loan and Note portfolios as a result of changes in interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 The fair values of Borrower Loans and the related Notes are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The fair value adjustments for Borrower Loans are largely offset by the fair value adjustments of the Notes due to the borrower payment dependent design of the Notes and due to the total principal balances of the Borrower Loans being very close to the total principal balances of the Notes. 
 Prosper Funding had Cash and Cash Equivalents of 3.0 million and 3.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts were held in various unrestricte d deposits with highly rated financial institutions and short term, highly liquid marketable securities which may include money market funds, U.S. treasury securities and U.S. agency securities. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. Due to their short-term nature, Prosper Funding believes that it does not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these liquid investments as a result of changes in interest rates. Decreases in short-term interest rates will moderately reduce interest income on these cash and cash equivalents, while increases in short-term interest rates will moderately increase the interest income earned on these cash and cash equivalent balances. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Item 2. Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Prosper None. 
 Prosper Funding Information for this Item is not required for Prosper Funding because it meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction H(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-Q; Prosper Funding is therefore filing this Form with the reduced disclosure format. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 On November 1, 2024, we completed a securitization of approximately 93.6 million in Credit Card receivables allocated to us and held on Coastal s balance sheet, through a securitization trust, Prosper Credit Card 2024-1 Issuer LLC PCC 2024-1 ). We purchased these Credit Card receivables and contributed to PCC 2024-1, which then issued four classes of notes to third-parties with stated principal balances totaling approximately 82.9 million. These notes are collateralized by the purchased Credit Card receivables. Our preliminary assessment is that PCC 2024-1 meets the criteria of a VIE and thus will be consolidated into our financial statements.
