 On March 8, 2024, we entered into a first amendment to the M T Credit Agreement. Among other changes, the first amendment eliminated testing of the total net leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants for certain test periods and reduced the required minimum current ratio financial covenant for certain test periods. Additionally, the first amendment created new financial covenants for minimum consolidated EBITDA and minimum liquidity. The first amendment also restricted our ability to make certain investments, dispositions and restricted payments, and it added a new pricing tier to the leveraged-based pricing grid for the M T Credit Facilities, with pricing basis points higher than the highest tier immediately prior to the first amendment. 
 
 On May 14, 2024, we entered into a second amendment to the M T Credit Agreement. The second amendment reduced the lenders aggregate commitment under the Floor Plan Credit Facility from million to million and further amended the definition of the applicable margin of the M T Credit Facilities to provide that, until the company achieves a total net leverage ratio for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2025 that is less than to 1.00 (such period, the Ratio Adjustment Period ), pricing would further increase by basis points higher than the highest tier that was in effect under the first amendment. The second amendment also provided that, during the Ratio Adjustment Period, the company would no longer be permitted to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the second amendment, testing of the total net leverage and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants were eliminated until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025, and the minimum amounts for the current ratio financial covenant were reduced for certain test periods. The second amendment also made certain adjustments to the minimum consolidated EBITDA and minimum liquidity financial covenants. We agreed in the second amendment to further restrictions on investments and dispositions, and we agreed to certain additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates. 
 
 Under the second amendment, we agreed to pay down million on our revolving credit facility by December 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid million of such required amount. 
 
 During July, August and September 2024, we were not in compliance with certain financial and other covenants under the M T Credit Agreement, and we entered into a series of temporary, limited waiver agreements with M T and the lenders party to the M T Credit Agreement. The M T limited waivers provided a temporary waiver of defaults resulting from, among other things: 
 
 our inability to comply with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant with respect to June, July, August, September and October 2024; 
 our inability to comply with the minimum liquidity financial covenant for July, August, September and October 2024; 
 our inability to comply with the minimum current ratio financial covenant for our fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024; and 
 the filing of certain mechanic s, materialman s, construction or similar liens against certain of our real property, relating to our failure to pay for certain improvements made thereto.

We also agreed, among other terms, to repay the Revolving Credit Facility by million, which we did on August 30, 2024; to provide M T and the lenders with an increased level of financial reporting; to engage CR3 Partners as our financial advisor; to cause an employee of CR3 Partners to be appointed as our interim Chief Financial Officer until a permanent Chief Financial Officer reasonably acceptable to M T is selected and approved by our board of directors; to attempt to raise new capital and to engage an investment banker to assist us in connection with doing so; to a new average daily liquidity financial covenant, which was tested weekly; to restrictions on transactions, including investments and dispositions, outside of the ordinary course of business; and to refrain from declaring dividends or making other restricted payments.

 Borrowings under the M T Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets other than real estate. 
 
 The M T Credit Agreement contains certain reporting and compliance-related covenants and negative covenants, among other things, related to borrowing and events of default. It also includes certain non-financial covenants and covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge with, acquire stock, or make investments in other companies, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, in addition to the lenders being able to declare amounts outstanding under the M T Credit Facilities due and payable or foreclose on the collateral, the lenders can elect to increase the interest rate by per annum during the period of default. The M T Credit Agreement contains a cross-default provision applicable to the Coliseum Loan Agreement, described below.

 Mortgages 
 In July 2023, we entered into mortgages for total proceeds of million secured by certain real estate assets at our Murfreesboro and Knoxville locations. The loans bear interest between and per annum and mature in July 2033. 
 
 Term Loan from Coliseum 
 On December 29, 2023, we entered into a term loan agreement (the Coliseum Loan Agreement with Coliseum Holdings I, LLC as lender (the Lender under which the Lender provided us with a term loan initially in the principal amount of million (the Loan ). The Lender is an affiliate of Coliseum Capital Management, LLC Coliseum ). The Loan has a maturity date of December 29, 2026. Certain funds and accounts managed by Coliseum held of our common stock (calculated as if the preferred stock has been converted into common stock) as of September 30, 2024, and the Lender is therefore considered a related party. 
 
 The Loan bears interest at a rate of per annum, payable monthly in cash on the outstanding loan balance, except that for any quarterly period during the first year of the Loan term, we have the option at the beginning of such quarter to make pay-in-kind elections, whereby the entire outstanding balance would be charged interest at per annum and interest amounts will be added to the outstanding principal rather than paid currently in cash. We exercised this option during each of the first four quarterly periods of the Loan. The Loan is secured by mortgages on all of our real estate, except our real estate at our Murfreesboro and Knoxville locations, and certain related assets. Issuance costs of million were recorded as debt discount and are being amortized over the term of the Loan to interest expense using the effective interest method. The Loan is carried at the outstanding principal balance, less debt issuance costs and is included in Related party debt, current portion and Related party debt, non-current portion, net of debt discount in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 On May 15, 2024, we entered into a first amendment to the Coliseum Loan Agreement. Under the first amendment, we borrowed an additional million advance of the Loan and, as additional security for such advance, we mortgaged to the Lender our real property located in Fort Pierce, Florida and certain related assets. In connection with the additional advance, we issued warrants to clients of Coliseum to purchase shares of our common stock at a price of per share, subject to certain adjustments. The warrants may be exercised at any time on or after May 15, 2024 and until May 15, 2034. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, including all interest paid-in-kind through such date, was million. 
 
 Under the terms of the Loan, for any repayments and prepayments that occur prior to January 1, 2025, we will owe a prepayment penalty of on the outstanding principal balance being repaid and a yield maintenance premium approximately equal to the remaining interest owed on such balance repaid from date of repayment through January 1, 2025. For repayments and prepayments that occur after January 1, 2025 through maturity, we will owe a prepayment penalty of on the outstanding principal balance being repaid. 
 
 The Coliseum Loan Agreement contains certain reporting and compliance-related covenants. The Coliseum Loan Agreement contains negative covenants, among other things, related to borrowing and events of default. It also includes certain non-financial covenants and covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge with, acquire stock, or make investments in other companies, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, in addition to the lender being able to declare amounts outstanding under the Loan due and payable or foreclose on the collateral, the lender can elect to increase the interest rate by per annum during the period of default. In addition, the Loan contains a cross-default provision applicable to the M T Credit Agreement.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, as well as our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2024. 
 
 Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements 
 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (including but not limited to this Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, reflecting our or our management team's expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions, strategies, estimates, and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future financial condition or results of operations. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate or continue or the negative of such words or variations of such words and similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that such forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, or cautionary statements, include, but are not limited to: 
 
 Future market conditions and industry trends, including anticipated national new recreational vehicle RV wholesale shipments; 
 Changes in U.S. or global economic and political conditions or outbreaks of war; 
 Changes in expected operating results, such as store performance, selling, general and administrative expenses SG A as a percentage of gross profit and all projections; 
 Our recent history of losses; 
 Our ability to obtain further waivers or amendments to our Credit Agreement 
 Our ability to procure and manage inventory levels to reflect consumer demand;

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities is defined as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for net (repayments) borrowings on floor plan notes payable. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, we review any non-GAAP financial measures in connection with a review of the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution you not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but also to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. As required by Securities Exchange Commission SEC rules, we have reconciled this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure reported in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe the non-GAAP financial measure we present improves the transparency of our disclosures; provides a meaningful presentation of our results from core business operations because items are excluded that are not related to core business operations and other non-cash items; and improves the period-to-period comparability of our results from core business operations. This presentation should not be considered an alternative to a GAAP measure.

 Overview 
 
 Lazydays has been a prominent player in the RV industry since our inception in 1976. We operate recreational vehicle dealerships and offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for RV owners and outdoor enthusiasts. We generate revenue by providing RV owners and outdoor enthusiasts a full spectrum of products: RV sales, RV repair and services, financing and insurance products, third-party protection plans, and after-market parts and accessories. 
 
 We operate 23 dealerships in 14 states. Based on industry research and management s estimates, we believe we operate the world s largest RV dealership, measured in terms of on-site inventory, located on approximately 126 acres outside Tampa, Florida. See Note 1 - Business Organization and Nature of Operations to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Lazydays offers one of the largest selections of leading RV brands in the nation, featuring more than 4,250 new and pre-owned RVs. We have more than 400 service bays, and each location has an RV parts and accessories store. We employ approximately 1,300 people at our 23 dealership locations. Our locations are staffed with knowledgeable local team members, providing customers access to extensive RV expertise. We believe our locations are strategically located and, based on information collected by us from reports prepared by Statistical Surveys, account for a significant portion of new RV units sold on an annual basis in the U.S. Our dealerships attract customers from all states except Hawaii. 
 
 We attract new customers primarily through Lazydays dealership locations as well as digital and traditional marketing efforts. Once we acquire customers, those customers become part of our customer database where we use customer relationship management tools and analytics to actively engage, market and sell our products and services. 
 
 In January 2024, we launched a complete rebranding effort with new websites, logos, fonts and colors, as well as a new stock symbol ("GORV"). We believe these rebranding efforts will enhance our digital retail experience, particularly on mobile devices, which account for over 80 of our website traffic.

 Same Store Results of Operations 
 
 We believe that same store comparisons are an important indicator of our financial performance. Same store measures demonstrate our ability to grow operations in our existing locations. 
 
 Same store measures reflect results for stores that were operating in each comparison period, and only include the months when operations occurred in both periods. For example, a store acquired in May 2023 would be included in same store operating data beginning in June 2024, after its first complete comparable month of operations. The first quarter operating results for the same store comparisons would include results for that store in only the month of June for both comparable periods.

 Revenue and Gross Margin Discussion 
 
 New Vehicles Retail 
 We offer a comprehensive selection of new RVs across a wide range of price points, classes and floor plans, from entry level travel trailers to Class A motorhomes at our dealership locations and on our website. We have strong strategic alliances with leading RV manufacturers. The core brands that we sell, represen ting 95 of t he new vehicles that we sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, are manufactured by Thor Industries, Inc., Winnebago Industries, Inc., and Forest River, Inc. 
 
 Under our business strategy, we believe that our new RV sales create incremental profit opportunities by providing used RV inventory through trade-ins, arranging of third-party financing, RV service and insurance contracts, future resale of trade-ins and parts and service work. 
 
 New vehicle revenue decreased 50.6 million, or 29.3 , in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a 13.1 decrease in average selling price per retail unit and an 18.6 decrease in new vehicle retail units sold. 
 
 New vehicle revenue decreased 114.1 million, or 21.4 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a 17.8 decrease in average selling price per retail unit and a 4.4 decrease in new vehicle retail units sold. 
 
 The decreases in average selling price per retail unit and units sold were primarily due to discounting of inventory and a contracting market, respectively. 
 
 New vehicle gross profit decreased 7.5 million, or 39.8 , in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the above mentioned factors impacting new vehicle revenue.

 New vehicle gross profit decreased 36.7 million, or 54.9 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the above mentioned factors impacting new vehicle revenue. New vehicle gross margin decreased 530 basis points primarily due to compression from the higher cost per new unit sold and the lower average selling price of new vehicles.

 Service, Body and Parts and Other 
 With approximately 400 service bays, we provide onsite general RV maintenance and repair services at all of our dealership locations. We employ over 270 highly skilled technicians, many of them certified by the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association RVIA or the National RV Dealers Association RVDA and we are equipped to offer comprehensive services and perform Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") warranty repairs for most RV components. Earnings from service, body and parts and other have historically been more resilient during economic downturns, when owners have tended to hold and repair their existing RVs rather than buy a new one. 
 
 Service, body and parts and other is a strategic area of focus and area of opportunity to grow additional earnings.

 The tax expense differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal needs for liquidity and capital resources are for capital expenditures and working capital as well as for growth through acquisitions and greenfielding. We have historically satisfied our liquidity needs through cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities as well as sale-leaseback arrangements. In addition to these sources of liquidity, potential sources to fund our business strategy include financing of owned real estate, construction loans, and 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 proceeds from debt or equity offerings. We evaluate all of these options and may select one or more of them depending upon overall capital needs and the availability and cost of capital, although no assurances can be provided that these capital sources will be available in sufficient amounts or with terms acceptable to us. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were not in compliance with all of the M T Credit Agreement or the Coliseum Loan Agreement covenants. However, we obtained waivers from such lenders which temporarily waived these covenants. The Company is not certain as to when the industry will recover and anticipates that unit sales may continue to be well below long-term averages and therefore believes the potential exists that it may continue to not be in compliance with existing financial covenants under the M T Credit Agreement for the twelve-month period after the issuance date of the financial statements. If the Company is not in compliance with its covenants, absent a further waiver, it will be an event of default that would give lenders the right, but not the obligation, to accelerate amounts outstanding. Such an event of default would trigger an event of default under the Coliseum Loan Agreement and would give the Lender the right, but not the obligation to accelerate amounts outstanding. In that event, the Company may need to seek other sources of capital and there can be no assurances that the Company would be able to do so on acceptable terms. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 13.5 million and our revolver was fully drawn. As of September 30, 2024, we hold approximately 126.5 million of real estate financed under our term loan mortgage facility with Coliseum that we estimate could provide approximately 40 million of additional liquidity at an estimated 75 loan to value as we refinance these properties.

 On March 8, 2024, we entered into a first amendment to the M T Credit Agreement. Among other changes, the first amendment eliminated testing of the total net leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants for certain test periods and reduced the required minimum current ratio financial covenant for certain test periods. Additionally, the first amendment created new financial covenants for minimum consolidated EBITDA and minimum liquidity. The first amendment also restricted our ability to make certain investments, dispositions and restricted payments, and it added a new pricing tier to the leveraged-based pricing grid for the M T Credit Facilities, with pricing 35 basis points higher than the highest tier immediately prior to the first amendment. 
 
 On May 14, 2024, we entered into a second amendment to the M T Credit Agreement. The second amendment reduced the lenders aggregate commitment under the Floor Plan Credit Facility from 525 million to 480 million and further amended the definition of the applicable margin of the M T Credit Facilities to provide that, until the company achieves a total net leverage ratio for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2025 that is less than 3.00 to 1.00 (such period, the Ratio Adjustment Period ), pricing would further increase by 15 basis points higher than the highest tier that was in effect under the first amendment. The second amendment also provided that, during the Ratio Adjustment Period, the company would no longer be permitted to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the second amendment, testing of the total net leverage and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants were eliminated until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025, and the minimum amounts for the current ratio financial covenant were reduced for certain test periods. The second amendment also made certain adjustments to the minimum consolidated EBITDA and minimum liquidity financial covenants. We agreed in the second amendment to further restrictions on investments and dispositions, and we agreed to certain additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates. 
 
 Under the second amendment, we agreed to pay down 10.0 million on our revolving credit facility by December 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 7.5 million of such required amount. 
 
 During July, August and September 2024, we were not in compliance with certain financial and other covenants under the M T Credit Agreement, and we entered into a series of temporary, limited waiver agreements with M T and the lenders party to the M T Credit Agreement. The M T limited waivers provided a temporary waiver of defaults resulting from, among other things: 
 
 our inability to comply with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant with respect to June, July, August, September and October 2024; 
 our inability to comply with the minimum liquidity financial covenant for July, August, September and October 2024; 
 our inability to comply with the minimum current ratio financial covenant for our fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024; and 
 the filing of certain mechanic s, materialman s, construction or similar liens against certain of our real property, relating to our failure to pay for certain improvements made thereto. 
 
 Under the limited waivers, we decreased the lenders aggregate commitment under the Floor Plan Credit Facility from 480 million to 400 million and agreed to a temporary limit on the outstanding loans under the Floor Plan Credit Facility of 380 million. We also agreed, among other terms, to repay the Revolving Credit Facility by 1 million, which we did on

 Mortgages 
 In July 2023, we entered into two mortgages for total proceeds of 29.3 million secured by certain real estate assets at our Murfreesboro and Knoxville locations. The loans bear interest between 6.85 and 7.10 per annum and mature in July 2033. 
 
 Term Loan from Coliseum 
 On December 29, 2023, we entered into a term loan agreement (the Coliseum Loan Agreement with Coliseum Holdings I, LLC as lender (the Lender under which the Lender provided us with a term loan initially in the principal amount of 35 million (the Loan ). The Lender is an affiliate of Coliseum Capital Management, LLC Coliseum ). The Loan has a maturity date of December 29, 2026. Certain funds and accounts managed by Coliseum held 81 of our common stock (calculated as if the preferred stock has been converted into common stock) as of September 30, 2024, and the Lender is therefore considered a related party. 
 
 The Loan bears interest at a rate of 12 per annum, payable monthly in cash on the outstanding loan balance, except that for any quarterly period during the first year of the Loan term, we have the option at the beginning of such quarter to make pay-in-kind elections, whereby the entire outstanding balance would be charged interest at 14 per annum and interest amounts will be added to the outstanding principal rather than paid currently in cash. We exercised this option during each of the first four quarterly periods of the Loan. The Loan is secured by mortgages on all of our real estate, except our real estate at our Murfreesboro and Knoxville locations, and certain related assets. Issuance costs of 2 million were recorded as debt discount and are being amortized over the term of the Loan to interest expense using the effective interest method. The Loan is carried at the outstanding principal balance, less debt issuance costs and is included in Related party debt, current portion and Related party debt, non-current portion, net of debt discount in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 On May 15, 2024, we entered into a first amendment to the Coliseum Loan Agreement. Under the first amendment, we borrowed an additional 15 million advance of the Loan and, as additional security for such advance, we mortgaged to the Lender our real property located in Fort Pierce, Florida and certain related assets. In connection with the additional advance, we issued warrants to clients of Coliseum to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 5.25 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The warrants may be exercised at any time on or after May 15, 2024 and until May 15, 2034. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, including all interest paid-in-kind through such date, was 54.8 million. 
 
 Under the terms of the Loan, for any repayments and prepayments that occur prior to January 1, 2025, we will owe a prepayment penalty of 1.0 on the outstanding principal balance being repaid and a yield maintenance premium approximately equal to the remaining interest owed on such balance repaid from date of repayment through January 1, 2025. For repayments and prepayments that occur after January 1, 2025 through maturity, we will owe a prepayment penalty of 2.0 on the outstanding principal balance being repaid. 
 
 The Coliseum Loan Agreement contains certain reporting and compliance-related covenants. The Coliseum Loan Agreement contains negative covenants, among other things, related to borrowing and events of default. It also includes certain non-financial covenants and covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge with, acquire stock, or make investments in other companies, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, in addition to the lender being able to declare amounts outstanding under the Loan due and payable or foreclose on the collateral, the lender can elect to increase the interest rate by 7.0 per annum during the period of default. In addition, the Loan contains a cross-default provision applicable to the M T Credit Agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in default under the Coliseum Loan Agreement resulting from the filing of certain mechanic s, materialman s, construction or similar liens against certain of the real property mortgaged to the Lender, relating to our failure to pay for certain improvements made thereto. On September 27, 2024, the Lender granted us a waiver with respect to this event of default provided that any such liens are discharged by specified deadlines. 
 
 On November 15, 2024, we obtained an additional waiver under the Coliseum Loan Agreement. See Note 15 Subsequent Events to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 In September 2024, RVIA issued a revised forecast for calendar year 2024 and 2025 wholesale unit shipments. The new forecast projects 2024 RV wholesale shipments to range between 311,600 to 336,600 units with a median of 324,100 units. Additional growth is expected through 2025 with wholesale shipments increasing to a range of 329,900 to 362,300 with a median of 346,100 units. 
 
 We believe that retail consumer interest remains high due to an ongoing interest in the RV lifestyle. While we anticipate that near-term demand will be influenced by many factors, including consumer confidence and the level of consumer spending on discretionary products, we believe future retail demand over the longer term will exceed historical, pre-pandemic levels as consumers continue to value the perceived benefits offered by the RV lifestyle. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced the impact of inflation on our operations, particularly with the increased cost of new vehicles. The price risk relating to new vehicles includes the cost from the manufacturer, as well as freight and logistics costs. Each of these costs have been impacted, to differing degrees, by factors such as high demand for product, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and increased fuel costs. 
 
 Inflationary factors, such as increases to our product and overhead costs, may adversely affect our operating results if the selling prices of our products and services do not increase proportionately with those increased costs or if demand for our products and services declines as a result of price increases to address inflationary costs. We finance substantially all of our new vehicle inventory and certain of our used vehicle inventory through revolving floor plan arrangements. Inflationary increases in the costs of new and/or used vehicles financed through the revolving floor plan arrangement result in an increase in the outstanding principal balance of the revolving floor plan arrangement. Additionally, our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and utilities, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Further, the cost of remodeling acquired RV dealership locations and constructing new RV dealership locations is subject to inflationary increases in the costs of labor and material, which results in higher rent expense on new RV dealership locations. Finally, our credit agreements include interest rates that vary based on various benchmarks. Such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation. 
 
 Cyclicality 
 
 Unit sales of RV vehicles historically have been cyclical, fluctuating with general economic cycles. During economic downturns the RV retailing industry tends to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy.

Table of Contents 

 We believe that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, fuel prices, interest rates and credit availability. 
 
 Seasonality and Effects of Weather 
 
 Our operations generally experience modestly higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first half of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the hospitable warm climate during the winter months at our Florida and Arizona locations. In addition, the northern locations in Colorado, Tennessee, Minnesota, Indiana, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin generally experience modestly higher vehicle sales during the spring months. 
 
 Our largest RV dealership is located near Tampa, Florida, which is in close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico. A severe weather event, such as a hurricane, could cause severe damage to property and inventory and decrease the traffic to our dealerships. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage, if we were to experience a catastrophic loss, we may exceed our policy limits and/or may have difficulty obtaining similar insurance coverage in the future. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes in the critical accounting policies and use of estimates described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Information requested by this Item 3 is not applicable as we have elected scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies with respect to this Item 3. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) or our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of the controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error and mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of controls and procedures to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the controls and procedures may have deteriorated. 
 
 In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, and due to the previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that is described below, which is still being remediated, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024, we previously identified a material weakness related to ineffective design and implementation of Information Technology General Controls ("ITGC") in the area of user access, program change management and security administration that are relevant to the preparation of the financial statements. Primarily, we did not design and maintain controls to ensure (a) access provisioned matched the access requested, (b) user access reviews were performed with complete and accurate data, (c) changes to internally developed applications were approved prior to deployment to 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 production and (d) security administration was appropriately maintained. As a result, our related process-level IT dependent manual and automated controls that rely on the affected ITGCs, or information from IT systems with affected ITGCs, were also deemed ineffective. Additionally, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that existed due to turnover of certain accounting positions during the fourth quarter of 2023 which resulted in the lack of sufficient documentation to support the effective performance of our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses did not result in any identified misstatements to our financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. 
 
 Notwithstanding the previously identified material weaknesses, which continues to be remediated, management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, believes the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Ongoing Remediation Efforts to Address the Previously Identified Material Weaknesses 
 Management has enhanced, and will continue to enhance, the risk assessment process and design and implementation of internal control over financial reporting. The remediation measures to correct the previously identified material weaknesses include enhancing the design and implementation of existing controls and creating new controls as needed to address identified risks and providing additional training to personnel including the appropriate level of documentation to be maintained to support internal controls over financial reporting. The previously identified material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than with respect to the remediation efforts described above in connection with the previously identified material weaknesses, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The information in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the primary risks related to our business and securities as described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, under Risk Factors in Item 1A. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 We have experienced management turnover, including turnover of our top executives, which creates uncertainties and could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Our success depends, in significant part, on the continued services of our senior management team and on our ability to attract, motivate, develop, and retain a sufficient number of other highly skilled personnel, including finance, marketing, sales, and operations personnel. The loss of any one or more members of our senior management team, for any reason, including resignation or retirement, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We experienced significant changes in our executive leadership in September 2024, including the resignations of John North as our Chief Executive Officer and Kelly Porter as our Chief Financial Officer. Our Board then appointed Ron Fleming, a former Senior Vice President of Operations of the Company, as our Interim Chief Executive Officer; promoted Amber Dillard as our Chief Operating Officer, and appointed Jeff Huddleston, a partner at CR3 Partners, as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. 
 Although we have endeavored to implement these management transitions in a non-disruptive manner, such transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may hamper our ability to meet our financial and operational goals. Such changes may also give rise to uncertainty among our customers, investors, vendors, employees and others concerning our future direction and performance. Any of the foregoing could result in significant disruptions to our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to execute on our business plans. 
 
 Risks Related to our Capital Stock 
 If we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may be delisted and the price of our common stock, our ability to access the capital markets and our financial condition could be negatively impacted. 
 Our common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbol GORV. To maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, maintaining a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). As we pursue capital-raising transactions, we intend to actively monitor the bid price of our common stock and its compliance with the listing requirement. If we fail to comply with the continued listing standards and the Nasdaq Capital Market delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we and our stockholders could face significant negative consequences including: reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of the Company; and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

 Attn Kelly Porter, CFO 
 Re Limited Waiver with Respect to Credit Agreement 
 Ladies and Gentlemen 
 Reference is made to that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2023 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the date hereof, the Credit Agreement ), by and among LDRV Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation (the Borrower Representative ), the Loan Parties party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto (each, a Lender and collectively, the Lenders ), and Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, a New York banking corporation, as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank. Capitalized terms used in this letter agreement (this Waiver and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement. 
 1. Preliminary Statements

 The Borrowers anticipate that they will be unable to (i) comply with the Minimum EBITDA Covenant as of June 30, 2024 (the Minimum EBITDA Default and (ii) deliver a Liquidity Certificate for the month ended June 30, 2024 on or before July 15, 2024 as required by the Liquidity Certificate Covenant (the Liquidity Certificate Default and, together with the Minimum EBITDA Default, the Specified Defaults ).

 2. Limited Waiver 
 Any determination that a Specified Default has occurred, will occur or is continuing is hereby temporarily waived and no Default or Event of Default on the basis of the Specified Defaults shall be deemed to be continuing for a period beginning from the date hereof and extending to the earliest to occur of (i) 11 59 P.M. (Eastern Time) on July 30, 2024 and (ii) the failure of any Loan Party to comply timely with any term, condition, or covenant set forth in this Waiver or the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default under the Credit Agreement (other than the Specified Defaults) (the Waiver End Date and such period, the Temporary Waiver Period ). 

On and as of the Waiver End Date, the limited and temporary waiver of the Specified Defaults set forth in this Section 2 shall automatically and without further notice cease to be of any force or effect and the Specified Defaults shall, from and after the Waiver End Date, be deemed to have occurred and be continuing as if never temporarily waived pursuant to this Waiver. The Loan Parties each agree that on and from the Waiver End Date, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties may at any time proceed to exercise any and all of the respective rights and remedies under the Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document and or applicable law to the extent that a Default or an Event of Default (including a Specified Default) has occurred and is continuing. The Loan Parties further agree that nothing herein shall be construed to limit any rights or remedies available to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties pursuant to the Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents in connection with the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default other than, during the Temporary Waiver Period, the Specified Defaults. 
 3. Covenants

 4. Until the expiration or termination of the Temporary Waiver Period, no Loan Party and no other Subsidiary shall, directly or indirectly

 b. declare or pay any Restricted Payment or 
 c. designate any Subsidiary a Designated Real Estate Subsidiary. 
 The failure of the Loan Parties to comply with the agreements set forth in this Section 3 hereof shall constitute an immediate Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, without further action or notice by or any behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person. 
 4. Miscellaneous 
 This Waiver shall become effective upon the Administrative Agent s receipt of an executed copy of this Waiver duly executed by the Loan Parties and the Required Lenders.

Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Waiver by electronic transmission will be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof. 
 The Loan Parties hereby certify to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that (a) as of the date hereof, no Default or Event of Default (other than the Specified Defaults) has occurred and is existing under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document as of the date hereof and (b) each of the representations and warranties made by any Loan Party in the Credit Documents is true and correct in all material respects on the date hereof, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date. 
 The Loan Parties acknowledge that this Waiver applies only to the terms and provisions of the Credit Documents referenced above and shall not be construed to be a consent in connection with, or a waiver or amendment of, any of the other terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents. Any references contained in the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document to the Credit Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the Credit Agreement, as modified hereby and as further amended, restated or otherwise modified after the date hereof. 
 The agreements contained herein shall not be construed as a consent, waiver or extension of any present or future violation of the above-referenced provisions or any of the other terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Documents nor shall the Loan Parties, by receipt of this Waiver, expect that any consent, waiver, forbearance or extension will be given in the future. This Waiver shall be deemed to be a Credit Document as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement. 
 The Borrowers shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for all reasonable and documented out-of- pocket costs and expenses (including all outstanding reasonable and documented attorneys fees of counsel to the Administrative Agent) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, and execution of this Waiver and the other agreements and documents executed and delivered in connection herewith in addition to any other outstanding fees and expenses owing (all outstanding reasonable and documented fees, expenses and disbursements of FTI), in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and incurred prior to the date hereof.
