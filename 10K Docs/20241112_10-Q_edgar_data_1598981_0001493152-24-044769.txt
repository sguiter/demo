million in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash of 
million held for long-term purposes, and 
million of working capital deficit as of September 30, 2024. The Company has a history of recurring operating losses, and its net
cash used in operating activities amounted to

million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The Company has also generated net cash provided by
financing activities of 
million and 
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accordingly, the Company s management cannot
ascertain that there is no substantial doubt that it will be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after
the date that its financial statements are issued. 

Management
intends to mitigate such conditions by supporting its continued growth, decreasing its cash used in operating activities through increased
revenues and increased margins from products sold to large retailers and its internet portals, and to the extent necessary, generate
cash provided by financing activities through its at the market ATM offering or other equity or debt financing means.

The Company determines an allowance for sales returns based upon historical experience. As of September 30, 2024,

expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company defers the revenue related to undelivered customer orders for which it was paid or has a right to be paid at each measurement
date. Such amounts are recognized as deferred revenues in the accompanying balance sheet. Deferred revenues amounted to and
 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The
costs associated with such deferred revenues are recognized as deferred charges in the accompanying balance sheet. Such charges include
the carrying value of related inventory, freight, and sales charges. The deferred charges amounted to and as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The
Company will maintain an allowance based on specific inventory items that have shown no activity over a reasonable period. The Company

expense on intangible assets amounted to and during the nine-month ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the E-commerce technology platforms it acquired in 2023.
Management determined that revenues could increase without increasing its operating expenses (and potentially decrease its general and
administrative expenses) using a different E-commerce technology platform. Management believes it will discontinue using its legacy platforms
and deploy a new E-commerce technology platform by October 1, 2025. Accordingly, the estimated useful life of its legacy platforms decreased
from to year. The reduced estimated useful life of the intangible asset indicated a possible impairment of the carrying value of
such intangible. Management prepared, with a third-party firm, an analysis of the future cash flows related to the legacy platform and
determined that, as of September 30, 2024, such future cash flows were lower than the carrying value of the related intangible asset.
Accordingly, management believes that its legacy platforms carrying value was impaired. Based on the future estimated discounted
cash flows, Management believes that the carrying value of the legacy platforms should be million. Accordingly, management recorded
an impairment expense of million and adjusted the carrying value of its legacy platform to million as of and during the quarter
ended September 30, 2024.

Company does not have historical stock prices that can be reliably determined for a period that is at least equal to the expected terms
of its options. The expected options terms are years, and its historical period is years. The Company relies on the expected
volatility of comparable peer-group publicly traded companies within its industry sector, to supplement the Company s historical
data for the period of the expected terms of the options that exceeds the period of the Company s historical volatility data.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes
included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis and other parts of this
Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans and expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and
assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, strategy, expectations, outlook, intentions, and projections. Our actual
results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several
factors, including those set forth in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, in this Form 10-Q, and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Please
also see the section entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements contained in this Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

We
have a series of advanced-safe-smart platform technologies. Our first and second-generation technologies enable light fixtures, ceiling
fans and other electrically wired products to be installed safely and plugged in to a ceiling s electrical outlet box within seconds,
and without the need to touch hazardous wires. The plug and play technology method is a universal power-plug device that has a matching
receptacle that is simply connected to the electrical outlet box on the ceiling, enabling a safe and quick plug and play installation
of light fixtures and ceiling fans in just seconds. The plug and play power-plug technology eliminates the need of touching hazardous
electrical wires while installing light fixtures, ceiling fans and other hard wired electrical products. In recent years, we have expanded
the capabilities of our power-plug product to include advanced-safe and quick universal installation methods, as well as advanced-smart
capabilities. The smart features include control of light fixtures and ceiling fans by the SkyHome App, through WIFI, Bluetooth Low Energy
and voice control. It allows scheduling, energy savings eco mode, dimming, back-up emergency light, night light, light color changing
and much more. Our third-generation technology is an all-in-one safe and smart-advanced platform that is designed to enhance all-around
safety and lifestyle of homes and other buildings. Our products are designed to improve all around home and building safety and lifestyle.
We are continuing to refine our products and began manufacturing certain advanced and smart products in 2023 and expect additional products,
including the third-generation smart-advanced platform to be available in 2024. We expect to manufacture the additional product offerings
within the next six months. We hold over 97 U.S. and global patents and patent applications and have received a variety of final electrical
code approvals, including UL, United Laboratories of Canada (cUL) and Conformit Europ enne (CE), and 2017 and 2020 inclusion
in the NEC Code Book. 

We
believe our total addressable market in the United States exceeds 500 billion, based on the Company s internal calculations derived
from the estimation of the total target user pool, projected average selling price, and projected units per household. We believe there
are billions of installations of light and other electrical fixtures globally. Our estimates of the addressable market for our products
may prove to be incorrect. The projected demand for our products could differ materially from actual demand. Even if the total addressable
market for our products is as large as we have estimated and even if we are able to gain market awareness and acceptance, we may not
be able to penetrate the existing market to capture additional market share. 

Inflation
and related risk of recession increased during 2022 and have continued to impact operations during 2023 and 2024. Inflationary factors,
such as increases in interest rates, supply and overhead costs and transportation costs, may adversely affect our operating results,
and we may not be able to offset increased costs with increased sales price per unit, particularly as we work toward commercial manufacturing
of our products. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
to date, we may experience some effect in the near future (especially if inflation rates continue to rise). In addition, we may be negatively
impacted because of supply chain constraints, consequences associated with government regulations, ongoing and potential geopolitical
conflicts, instability in the global banking system, employee availability and wage increases. 

The
Israel-Hamas-Lebanon war may adversely impact our operations in the near future. We have a number of developers working in Israel. If
such individuals are called for service or this war escalates regionally, it may create work interruptions leading to longer periods
between releases of offering improvements and increased costs. 

During
April 2023, we completed the previously announced acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of Belami, a strategic e-commerce
lighting and home d cor conglomerate. The Company paid cash and issued an aggregate of 3,776,706 shares of our common stock as
consideration for the acquisition. The Company expects that Belami will serve as a marketing and growth platform and should provide several
distribution channels for our products, including to retail customers, builders, and professionals. 

In
connection with the acquisition, the Company engaged in private placements of its securities during the first quarter of 2023, pursuant
to which the Company issued and sold (i) subordinated secured convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of 10.35
million and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 1,391,667 shares of the Company s common stock. The proceeds were used
to fund the cash component of the Belami acquisition and to pay certain transaction expenses in connection with the acquisition and the
private placements.

Recent
Developments 

In
March 2024, the Company and the Belami sellers entered into a letter agreement modifying certain obligations under the stock purchase
agreement for the acquisition of Belami. In connection with the letter agreement, the Company issued convertible promissory notes to
each of the sellers (the Seller Note(s) in substitution of an aggregate of 3,117,408 in cash due to the sellers on the
first anniversary of the closing of the Belami acquisition. Each seller received a Seller Note in an amount of 1,039,303 on the same
date. In addition to other customary terms, the Seller Notes bear annual interest at 10 , with interest and principal coming due on May
16, 2025, and can be converted by the sellers into shares of our common stock at any time at 3.00 per share of our common stock. The
Seller Notes include customary events of default accelerating maturity, including a breach of the Company s covenants, representations,
and warranties under the Belami stock purchase agreement and a change of control of Belami. The letter agreement further provided that
the Company would perform all other obligations arising on the first anniversary of the closing, including issuance of shares of common
stock due to sellers, and that on such date the non-fundamental representations and warranties will expire, and the Company would release
 750,000 held in escrow. In April 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,853,421 shares of common stock to the sellers and released
the escrow amount. 

On
April 11, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the letter agreement previously entered into with GE Trademark Licensing, Inc. GE-TL in December 2023, which extended the deadline for the Company to issue the convertible note to GE-TL to May 1,
2024, and also issued a three-year, 1.0 million convertible note to GE-TL, thereby reducing obligations due in 2027 by 400,000. The
note does not bear interest, and the principal amount of the note is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at any
time at the option of the holder at 1.07 per share. 

During
the second quarter of 2023, we began our at the market offering ATM pursuant to which we may sell up to 20 million of
shares of our common stock. 

During
October 2024, the Company completed its authorization of the issuance of 440,000 shares each of newly authorized Series A Preferred Stock
and Series A-1 Preferred Stock which generated proceeds of 11.0 million. 

The

The
increase in revenues during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due increased weighted average price of lighting
and heating products offset by a decrease of units sold. The increase in revenues during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024
is primarily due to revenues from products marketed by Belami which was acquired on April 28, 2023. 

We
believe that revenues will be higher in 2024 than in 2023, primarily resulting from revenues from Belami, which was acquired in April
2023 and the sale of our advanced and smart products. We believe that our revenues will be higher in 2025 than in 2024 primarily resulting
from revenues from the sale of our advanced and smart products.

The
cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with selling the products marketed by Belami. The increase in cost of revenues
during the 2024 interim periods is commensurate with the increase in revenues and is primarily due to costs associated with revenues
from products marketed by Belami which was acquired on April 28, 2023. 

We
believe that the cost of revenues will increase in 2024 compared to 2023, commensurate with an anticipated increase in revenues.

The
increase in selling and marketing expenses during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to increased marketing
programs expenses. The increase in selling and marketing expenses during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is primarily
due to such expenses increasing following the acquisition of Belami on April 28, 2023

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of an allocation of product development, finance, legal, human resources, including salaries,
wages, and benefits, and depreciation and amortization, including share-based payments. 

The
increase in general and administrative expenses during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the following: 

Nonrecurring
 impairment charge of 1.1 million of our E-commerce technology platforms which will be discontinued
 in September 2025 which will be replaced by a new platform expected to increase our revenues
 and possibly decrease our general and administrative expenses, offset by a decrease in share-based
 payments. 

The
decrease in general, and administrative expenses during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the following: 

Decreased
 share-based payments resulting from greater issuance of shares to employees following the acquisition of Belami, Inc. during the
 second quarter of 2023; 

Offset
by increased amortization of intangibles which were amortized over nine months during 2024 and five months during
2023, following the acquisition of Belami in April 2023. The
increase of depreciation and amortization expenses of 1.0 million primarily related to increased intangibles acquired during the second
quarter of 2023. Additionally, we recognized an impairment expense of 1.1 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

We
believe that our operating expenses will be higher during 2024 when compared to 2023 as we continue to invest to support our anticipated
growth which now includes such expenses related to Belami s operations following its acquisition.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, and 2023, we had 13.0 million and 22.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, respectively. 

We
have raised additional funds through the sale of our common stock for gross proceeds of 4.4 million pursuant to placements and offerings
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

These
offerings included shares sold pursuant to our ATM offering program which provides us with additional access to capital, as needed, subject
to market conditions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not issue any shares of common stock under such program.
From inception through September 30, 2024, we issued 7,894,899 shares of common stock under such a program for net proceeds of 13,795,059,
net of brokerage fees and legal fees of 619,415. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount to be used under the ATM offering program
is 5.9 million. 

On
October 4, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 440,000 shares of two series of preferred stock, resulting in total gross proceeds of 11.0
million, pursuant to (i) a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into with an accredited investor, pursuant to which such investor purchased
an aggregate of 200,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of 25.00 per share, and (ii) a Securities Purchase Agreement
entered into with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which such investors purchased an aggregate of 240,000 shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of 25.00 per share. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the Belami integration of operations, our revenue
growth rate, expenditures related to our headcount growth and manufacturing, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers,
the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the price at which
we are able to purchase parts to incorporate in our product offerings, the introduction of platform enhancements, and the market adoption
of our platforms. We may continue to enter arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies.
We may, because of those arrangements, or the general expansion of our business, be required to seek additional equity or debt financing.
If we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable
to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not
be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We
owe approximately 15.6 million under fixed rate obligations as of September 30, 2024. In addition, we owe GE certain minimum royalty
payments under a license agreement and other accrued expenses which amounted to 2.3 million as of September 30, 2024. 

On
March 29, 2024, we entered into a letter agreement with Belami sellers, modifying certain obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement.
In connection with the letter agreement, the Company issued convertible promissory notes to each of the Sellers (the Seller Note(s) in substitution of an aggregate of 3,117,408 in cash due to the Sellers on the first anniversary of the Closing. Each Seller received
a Seller Note in the amount of 1,039,303 on the same date. In addition to other customary terms, the Seller Notes bear annual interest
at 10 , with interest and principal coming due on May 16, 2025, and can be converted by the Sellers at any time at 3.00 per share of
our common stock. 

On
September 23, 2024, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Belami, entered into a 3.5 million secured revolving line of credit
(the line of credit with a commercial bank, increasing, and renewing its previous revolving line of credit with such bank.
The line of credit bears interest at a variable rate per annum equal to The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, subject to a floor of 7.5

to customary default and acceleration provisions and to certain financial covenants, including working capital in excess of 1.75 million
and a debt service coverage ratio in excess of 1.25 to 1.00 (calculated as described in the business loan agreement governing the line
of credit). In addition, the Company agreed to guarantee Belami s obligations under the line of credit, pursuant to a commercial
guaranty agreement. 

As
common with companies having a similar cash conversion cycle as ours, when sales are converted into cash rapidly, often referred to as
the Dell Working Capital Model, we leverage our trades payable to finance our operations to lower our cost of capital,
and accordingly, we may have negative working capital. This negative working capital is partly inherent to the relatively quick turnaround
of finished goods inventory, quicker collection of accounts receivables, and longer payment cycle of trades payable. Our accounts receivable,
inventory, net of trades payable, amounted to (7.5) million and (7.2) million as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

During
October 2024, the Company authorized the issuance of 440,000 shares of newly authorized Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1
Preferred Stock which generated proceeds of 11.0 million. We received 2.3 million of such proceeds in September 2024. The designations
of each class of preferred stock are as follows: 

Series
A Preferred Stock: 

Cumulative
 dividend of 8 annually, 12 if paid after dividend date; 
 
 Original
 issue price of 25 per share; 
 
 Conversion
 option at the holder s option at 2 per share, with a subsequent reset provision of
 1.20 per share; 
 
 Redemption
 at the price of 25 per share at the Company s option after 5 years or upon change
 of control (substantially outside the control of the holder) 
 
 Voting
 rights on as converted basis. 

Series
A-1 Preferred Stock: 

Cumulative
 dividend of 8 annually, 12 if paid after dividend date; 
 
 Original

Going
Concern 

The
Company s liquidity sources include 13.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and 11.7 million of working
capital deficit as of September 30, 2024. The Company has a history of recurring operating losses and its net cash used in operating
activities amounted to 13.0 million and 10.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The Company
has also generated net cash provided by financing activities of 4.1 million and 19.6 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accordingly, the Company s management cannot ascertain that there is no substantial doubt that
it will be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that its financial statements are issued. 

Management
intends to mitigate such conditions by supporting its continued growth, decreasing its cash used in operating activities through increased
revenues and increased margins from products sold to large retailers and its internet portals, and to the extent necessary, generate
cash provided by financing activities through its at the market offering or other equity or debt financing means. 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

Management
considers earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted, an important indicator in evaluating
our business on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables
our management to monitor and evaluate our business on a consistent basis. We use EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others,
to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions.
We believe that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not part of our core operations, such as interest expense and amortization
and impairment expense associated with intangible assets, or items that do not involve a cash outlay, such as share-based payments, and
non-recurring items, such as transaction costs. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute
for, pre-tax income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows used in operating activities. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes significant
expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. Investors should
review the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure included below. Investors should
not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023
contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following is a summary of those accounting policies
that involve significant estimates and judgment of management. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. 

26 

Such
estimates and assumptions impact both assets and liabilities, including but not limited to: net realizable value of accounts receivable
and inventory, estimated useful lives and potential impairment of property and equipment, the valuation of intangible assets, estimate
of fair value of share based payments and derivative liabilities, estimates of fair value of warrants issued and recorded as debt discount,
estimates of tax liabilities and estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities. 

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of
a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating
its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future non-conforming events. Accordingly, actual results could differ
significantly from estimates. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

Disclosures
about fair value of financial instruments require disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance
sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we believe the amounts reported
for cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, accrued interest, notes payable and
convertible note payable approximate fair value because of their short maturities. 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include: 

Level
 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 

Level
 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted
 prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;
 and 

Level
 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions,
 such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation ,
which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, non-employee and director services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award
(presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange
for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. 

Stock-based
compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award granted using the Black- Scholes option pricing model based
on projections of various potential future outcomes and recognized over the period in which the award vests. For stock awards no longer
expected to vest, any previously recognized stock compensation expense is reversed in the period of termination. The stock-based compensation
expense is included in general and administrative expenses. 

27 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
account for revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(Topic 606). 

Under
Topic 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects
the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 

We
determine revenue recognition through the following steps: 

identification
 of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 

identification
 of the performance obligations in the contract; 

determination
 of the transaction price; 

allocation
 of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 

recognition
 of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Although
there are several new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we have adopted
or will adopt, as applicable, we do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had or will have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that is designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls
and procedures and any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving
their control objectives. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our Principal Executive Officers and Principal Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the evaluation, our Principal Executive Officers and
Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

28 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. As of the date of this Form 10-Q,
we are not a party to any material legal matters or claims. Legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and the outcome of a particular
matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the
loss or our income for that particular period. 

We
assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available.
Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated
financial statements. These legal accruals may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where
a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we do not record an accrual, consistent with applicable accounting
guidance. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

There
have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, other than as noted below. Our business, operations and financial results are
subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition,
and the trading price of our common stock. You should carefully read and consider the risks and uncertainties included in the report
referenced above, together with all of the other information in such report and this Form 10-Q, including the section titled Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related
notes, and other documents that we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described in these reports may not be the only ones
we face, and the disclosure of any risk factor should not be interpreted to imply that the risk has not already materialized. The factors
discussed in these reports, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed
in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and
oral statements. 

We
have begun to incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities in our product offerings, which may present operational and reputational
risks. 

We
are in the early stages of incorporating artificial intelligence AI capabilities into certain product offerings. These
features may become important in our operations over time. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products
more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of
operations. Additionally, if the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are or are alleged to
be deficient, inaccurate, or biased, we could be subject to competitive risks, potential legal liability, and reputational harm, and
our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. The use of AI capabilities may also result in
cybersecurity incidents, and any such cybersecurity incidents related to our use of AI capabilities could adversely affect our business.
Furthermore, the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, and compliance with new
or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and may limit our ability
to use AI technologies in our products. There can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to mitigate the potential risks related
to the use of AI technologies in our products will be sufficient. Failure to appropriately respond to this evolving landscape may result
in legal liability, regulatory action or brand and reputational harm. 

The
issuance of shares of convertible preferred stock reduced the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, and the conversion
of such stock into shares of common stock could materially dilute our stockholders. 

Holders
of our preferred stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted
to a vote of the holders of our common stock. As a result, the issuance of the preferred stock effectively reduces the relative voting
power of the holders of our common stock. In addition, the conversion of the preferred stock into shares of our common stock would dilute
the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon
conversion of the preferred stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Sales by such holders of a substantial
number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse
effect on the price of our common stock.

CERTIFICATION 

I,
John P. Campi, certify that: 

1.
I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of SKYX Platforms Corp.; 

2.
Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
period covered by this report; 

3.
Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
report; 

4.
The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
