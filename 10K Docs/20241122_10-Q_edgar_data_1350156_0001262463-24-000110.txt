 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

 For the Three months ended August 31, 2024 (unaudited) 

shares of the common stock of the Company with a par value
of . The Company had no operations prior to the date of the aforementioned acquisition. 

The business objective of the Company is the development,
distribution, marketing and sale of health care payment processing services and products. The Company has realized only nominal revenues
from its planned operations. 

The operations of the Company are expected to be primarily
undertaken by its wholly owned subsidiary, PreAxia Health Care Payment Ltd. PreAxia Payment ), incorporated pursuant to
the laws of the Province of Alberta on November 26, 2015. 

PreAxia Payment is in the process of developing an
online access system creating a health spending account that will facilitate card payment and processing services to third-party administrators,
insurance companies and others. 

and used cash in operating activities of , and as of August 31, 2024, had a stockholders deficit of and an accumulated
deficit of . These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
within one year of the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company s consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital and to ultimately achieve profitable operations. Currently,
the Company does not have significant cash or other material assets, nor does it have operations or a source of revenue sufficient to
cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company s officers or principal shareholders are committed
to making advances or loans to pay for certain legal, accounting, and administrative costs. 

The Company hopes to be able to attract suitable investors
for our business plan, which will not require us to use our cash. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this
situation. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case
of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

The fair value estimates discussed herein are based
upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. The carrying
amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between
the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements
relating to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by
terminology such as may, should, intends, expects, plans, anticipates, 
 believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks,

different from any future results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

Such factors include, among others, the following:
international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; the ability of PreAxia to sustain, manage
or forecast its growth; the ability of PreAxia to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability;
new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or failure to comply with government regulations;
adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results;
changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability
to protect technology; and other factors referenced in this and previous filings. 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected
in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity or performance. Except
as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking
statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Given these uncertainties, readers of this Form 10-Q
and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. PreAxia disclaims any obligation
to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein
to reflect future events or developments, except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States. 

All amounts stated herein are in US dollars unless
otherwise indicated. 

The management s discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The following
discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial
statements for the year ended May 31, 2024, together with notes thereto. As used in this quarterly report, the terms we, 
 us, our, PreAxia and the Company means PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 

General Overview 

Corporate Overview 

 PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc. (the
 Company or PreAxia was incorporated on April 3, 2000 in the State of Nevada. 

 The Company primarily undertakes its operations
through its wholly owned subsidiary, PreAxia Health Care Payment Limited PreAxia Payment ). PreAxia Payment was incorporated
pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta on November 26, 2015. 

 General Overview 

PreAxia Payment is a company which intends
to deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment market, specifically the opportunities
tied to the growth of health spending accounts HSA ). There is a rapid shift in healthcare traditional payment models to
consumer-directed healthcare that is creating significant opportunities for financial services and insurance industries to deliver new
dynamic products to this emerging market. 

5 

Spawned by the need to address escalating health
care costs, changes in the regulatory environment and the growing consumer desire for greater participation in the management of their
health benefits, the boundaries between health care and the financial services industries are becoming increasingly blurred. With the
trend towards self-directed health payment solutions and the growing demand for faster, easier and more convenient benefit services, the
insurance and benefits industries are banking on HSA medical payments being their next big growth conduit. Studies suggest that HSAs in
the US reached 123.3 billion in assets in 2023 and 37.4 million consumers in 2023, an increase of more than 18 of assets over the prior
year. This coupled with the continued growth of the Canadian group insurance industry illustrates the emerging opportunity for innovative
health payment services. We intend to initially launch our products in Canada. We believe that Canadian businesses are embracing a new
healthcare financing vehicle to provide greater value to employees, increase profitability and get more return from their investment.
We intend to provide them with services to capture this market opportunity. 

 Plan of Operation 

Over the next twelve months, we plan to: 

(a) 
 Raise additional capital to execute our business plans; 

(b) 
 Penetrate the health care processing markets in Canada, the United States and worldwide, by continuing to develop innovative health care processing products and services; 

(c) 
 Build up a network of strategic alliances with several types of health insurance companies, governments and other alliances in various vertical markets, and; 

(d) 
 Fill the positions of senior management sales, administrative and engineering positions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of August 31, 2024, PreAxia s cash balance
was 1 compared to 14 as of May 31, 2024. Our Company will be required to raise capital to fund our operations. PreAxia
had a working capital deficit of 2,400,806 as of August 31, 2024, compared with a working capital deficit of 2,396,179 as of May 31,
2024. 

Our net cash used in operating activities for three
months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 is 2,396 and 13,599, respectively. Our net loss for the three months ended August 31, 2024 of
 4,627 was the main contributing factor for our negative cash flow offset mainly by increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities
of 2,231. 

Our net cash provided by investing activities for
the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 is 0 and 0 respectively. 

Our net cash (used in) provided by financing activities
for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 is 2,383 and 13,948, respectively, mainly due to advances loan payable 
shareholders and advances -related party. 

Our ability to meet our financial liabilities and
commitments is primarily dependent upon the continued issuance of equity to new stockholders and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable
operations. PreAxia's cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for the next
twelve-month period. We will not initially have any cash flow from operating activities as we are in the startup stage. We
project that we will require an estimated 1,000,000 over the next twelve-month period to pay our arms-length creditors approximately
 300,000 plus an additional 700,000 to complete our business plan. The Company plans to raise the capital required to satisfy our
immediate short-term needs and additional capital required to meet our estimated funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily
through the private placement of our equity securities or by way of loans or such other means as PreAxia may determine. 

There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain
the funds required for our continued operations. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us
when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional
financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become
due, and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business. 

6 

There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term financing, successful and sufficient
market acceptance of our products and achieving a profitable level of operations. The Company hopes to be able to attract suitable
investors for our business plan, which will not require us to use our cash. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful
in this situation. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of
our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities
and future cash commitments. 

Our working capital (deficit) as of August 31, 2024
and May 31, 2024 is summarized as follows: 

Working Capital 

August 31, 2024 
 May 31, 2024

 Current Liabilities

 Working Capital Deficit 
 (2,400,806 
 (2,396,179 

The increase in our working capital deficit of 4,627
was primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 2,231 and advance related party of 2,214. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 

Results of Operations Three Months ended
August 31, 2024 and 2023 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and
2023 

Our operating results for the three months ended August
31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 are described below: 

Revenue 

During the three months ended August 31,
2024 and 2023, the Company had revenue of 0 and 0, respectively. The Company earns a 10 commission on amounts reimbursed for eligible
expenses. 

 Expenses 

Our total expenses for the three months ended August
31, 2024 were 4,627 compared to 40,919 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in total expenses of 36,292 for the
three months ending August 31, 2024 is due to a decrease in consulting fees of 30,000, decrease in professional fees of 5,214, an increase
of 442 in office and administration fees, and a decrease in research and development of 1,520. 

Consulting Fees 

During the three months ended August 31, 2024 and
2023, Tom Zapatinas, the Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company, earned 0 and 30,000, respectively, for consulting services
provided to the Company, which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities
 related party. During the period from June 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024, the Company did not accrue compensation to Tom Zapatinas.

Research and Development 

Research and development
expenses during the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 0 , as
compared to 1,520 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease is due to a decrease in software lease expenses from Microsoft. 

Wages and Benefits 

There were no wages and benefits during the three
months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Office and Administration 

Office and administration expenses increase by 442 for
the three months ended August 31, 2024 due to a decrease in office supply expense and filing fees 

Professional Fees 

Professional fees during the three months ended August
31, 2024 decreased by 5,214 to 2,500, as compared to 7,714 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. Professional fees decreased
due to decrease in costs related to accounting assistance. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense is 0 for the three months ended
August 31, 2024 and 2023 because accounts payable and accrued liabilities related party, convertible note payable related
party and loans payable shareholders are non-interest bearing. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We have identified certain accounting policies, described
below, that are the most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations. Please refer to Note
2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a full and complete disclosure of our accounting policies.
