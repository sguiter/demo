Losses
have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for product research and development and for marketing of
the Company s products; including the general and administrative expenses associated with the organization. 

While
we have generated relatively little revenue to date, revenue from sales of product began to increase in the quarter ended March 31, 2021,
and we continue to receive inquiries and solicit orders from a range of customers for our products, indicating what we believe is a significant
level of market interest for BasaFlex . While the Company expects to restart its manufacturing during 2025, based on our current
limited manufacturing capacity there is no guarantee that orders will actually be received or that orders, if received, can be properly
fulfilled. 

We
have historically satisfied our working capital requirements through the sale of restricted common stock of the Company, 0.001 par value
per share (the Common Stock ), and the issuance of warrants to purchase Common Stock and promissory notes. Until we are
able to internally generate meaningful revenue and positive cash flow, we will attempt to fund working capital requirements through third
party financing, including through potential private or public offerings of our securities as well as bridge or other loan arrangements.
However, a number of factors continue to hinder the Company s ability to attract new capital investment. We cannot provide any
assurances that the required capital will be obtained at all, or that the terms of such required capital may be acceptable to us. If
we are unable to obtain adequate financing, we may reduce our operating activities to reduce our cash use until sufficient funding is
secured. If we are unable to secure funding when needed, our results of operations may suffer, and our business may fail. 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or
the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
 OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This
overview provides a high-level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an
understanding of these trends is important to understand our financial results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 and
2023, respectively. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion
and analysis provided elsewhere in this report, and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in
the Annual Report in Form-10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 and filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This

as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). These forward-looking statements are based on our management s
beliefs, assumptions, and expectations and on information currently available to our management. Generally, you can identify forward-looking
statements by terms such as may, will, should, could, would, expects, 
 plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, projects, predicts, 
 potential and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in
nature. All statements that address operating or financial performance, events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur
in the future are forward-looking statements, including without limitation our expectations with respect to the timing for our planned
manufacturing expansion, the benefits of our products, customer leads, product sales, financings, or the commercial viability of, and
prospects for, our business model. We may not actually achieve the plans, projections or expectations disclosed in forward-looking statements,
and actual results, developments or events (including, without limitation, those related to our planned manufacturing capacity expansion
and our sales and marketing initiatives) could differ materially from those disclosed in the forward-looking statements. Our management
believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements because they speak only as of the date when made. We do not assume any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by federal securities laws
and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). We may not actually achieve the plans, projections or
expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and actual results, developments or events could differ materially and adversely
from those disclosed in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties,
including, without limitation, those described from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as the
risk factors and other disclosures contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023. 

Basanite,
Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries are referred to in this discussion as the Company , we , our ,
or us . Common stock refers to the common stock of the Company. 

Overview 

On
May 30, 2006, Basanite, Inc. was formed as a Nevada corporation. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Basanite Industries, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company BI ), we manufacture a range of green (environmentally friendly), sustainable,
non-corrosive, lightweight, composite products used in concrete reinforcement by the construction industry. Our core product is BasaFlex ,
a basalt fiber reinforced polymer reinforcing bar rebar which we believe is a stronger, lighter, sustainable, non-conductive
and corrosion-proof alternative to traditional steel. 

Our
two other main product lines are BasaMix , which are fine denier basalt fibers available in various chopped sizes, and BasaMesh ,
a line of Basalt Geogrid Mesh Rolls, intended to replace welded wire mesh (made of steel) and other fiber reinforced polymer grids and
mesh. 

16 

BasaMix 
is designed to help absorb the stresses associated with early-aged plastic shrinkage and settlement cracking in concrete, as well as
providing an increased toughness for enhanced reinforcement in Slab on Grade (SOG) and precast elements. BasaMix also serves in
a system approach for optimum performance of a concrete element when used in conjunction with our BasaFlex rebar. 

BasaMesh 
is designed for secondary and temperature shrinkage reinforcement. BasaMesh can also work in conjunction with the BasaFlex 
rebar or BasaMix for a total reinforcement program. 

Each
of our products is specifically designed to extend the lifecycle of concrete products by eliminating concrete spalling. 
Spalling results from the steel reinforcing materials embedded within the concrete member rusting (contrary to popular belief, concrete
is porous, and water can permeate into concrete). Rusting leads to the steel expanding and eventually causing the surrounding concrete
to delaminate, crack, or even break off, resulting in potential structural failure. We believe that each of our products addresses this
important need along with other key requirements in today s construction market. 

We
believe that the following attributes of BasaFlex provide it with a competitive advantage in the marketplace: 

BasaFlex never
 corrodes : steel reinforcement products rust, leading to spalling and significant repair costs down the road; 

BasaFlex 
 is sustainable : BasaFlex is made from Basalt rock, the most abundant rock found on Earth s surface, and offers a
 longer product lifecycle than traditional steel (the lack of corrosion allows the life span of concrete products reinforced with
 BasaFlex to be significantly longer); 

BasaFlex 
 is green : From mining, through production, to installation at the building site, BasaFlex has an exceptionally
 low carbon footprint when compared with that of steel; and 

BasaFlex has
 a lower in-place cost : the physical nature of our products relative to steel result in a lower net cost to the contractor once
 installed, such as: BasaFlex is one-quarter of the weight of equivalent sized steel, meaning 4 times the quantity of material
 can be delivered by the same truck (or container); all Basanite products can be loaded/unloaded and moved around the jobsite by hand
 no expensive handling equipment is needed; less concrete is required as BasaFlex does not require the extra concrete
 cover needed when using steel; and Basanite products are safer and easier to use. We believe all these factors materially reduce
 the net in-place cost of concrete reinforcement. 

We
believe that macroeconomic factors are pressuring the construction industry to consider the use of alternative reinforcement materials
for the following reasons: 

the increasing need for global infrastructure repair; 

recent design trends towards increasing the lifespan
 of projects and materials; 

the global interest in promoting the use of sustainable
 products; and 

increasing consideration of both the long-term costs
 and environmental impacts of material selections. 

We
believe we are well positioned to benefit from this renewed focus, particularly in light of the interest of the U.S. government in funding
infrastructure improvements and events such as the collapse of a residential building in Surfside, Florida. 

Inflation
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 

In
the past fiscal years, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. However, during the second half of 2021, throughout
2022 and into 2023, the U.S. economy has entered a period of increasing inflation. Should inflation persist or increase, interest
rates rise and could have a significant effect on the economy in general and, thereby, could affect prices for raw materials we use,
demand for our products, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor and our future operating results. 

17 

Supply Chain 

In
the past year, supply chain shortages or delays have had an immaterial impact on our operations. Our raw material suppliers have maintained
a consistent flow of goods which we expect to reengage when manufacturing capabilities are projected to restart in 2025. However, we
might experience supply chain challenges in the future, which could harm our business and our results of operations. 

War in Ukraine 

The recent war in Ukraine has
led the world to issue sanctions on the government of Russia. This has shut down our ability to procure basalt fiber material from our
secondary supplier, UWF/Kamenny Vek. Nonetheless, we are currently qualifying alternate material from other suppliers to preserve our
options in case of further disruptions. 

Government
Approvals and Specifying of our Products 

We
continue to pursue additional product and facility qualifications and approvals, and these qualifications and approvals are critical
to the market acceptance of our products. BI is currently testing products at two independent laboratories and received ICC-ES certification,
which was granted in the second quarter of 2023, and a Florida Department of Transportation FDOT production facility
and product approval, which was also granted in the second quarter of 2023 (we are already selling to FDOT projects on an individual
basis through exemptions or specs). The FDOT approval will allow us to bid on any project approved for BFRP. We anticipate that with
these two approvals the prospects of new projects will increase. 

Results of
Operations 

Revenue: We had revenue of
 62,836 and 209,176 from sales of finished goods for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 49,140 and 317,664
in the prior year. The increase in revenue in the year-over-year periods was due to our manufacturing constraints and limited working
capital and a shift in the product families sold to our customer base. 

Cost
of goods sold: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cost of sales of 31,127 and 65,579 compared to 53,640
and 167,223 in the prior year. We lost money on a gross margin basis due to normal inefficiencies in the start-up and ramping and scaling
process, including limited initial sales volume, and further due to extremely narrow margins on the initial sales of our products as
we began introducing them to the marketplace as well as limited manufacturing capabilities. 

Operating
Expenses 

Sales, General, and Administrating
Expenses: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general, and administrative were 168,856 and 508,205
compared to 332,560 and 1,302,699, respectively in the prior year. The primary components of selling, general, and administrative expenses
were as follows: 

Payroll
and related costs: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, payroll and related costs were 54,554 and 86,223, respectively
compared to 134,793 in the prior period. The decrease was due to the reduction of staff in 2023. The Company expects to return to a
fully staffed operation by year end 2025. 

Consulting
fees: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, consulting fees were 0 compared to 229,615 in the prior period. The
Company utilized financial consultants in the prior period in connection with its equity financing, management of the Company and fundraising. 

Legal
fees: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, legal fees were 22,716 and 84,060 compared to 135,072 in the prior
period. Legal fees increased primarily due to ongoing matters in the current period. 

Accounting
and audit fees: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, accounting and audit fees were 12,000 and 42,000, respectively,
compared to 80,180 in the prior period. Accounting and audit fees consisted of annual audit fees and the cost of outside consultants
in the preparation of the Company s financial statements. 

18 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Since
inception, we have incurred net operating losses and negative cash flow. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 57,347,523.
We have incurred general and administrative expenses associated with our product development and compliance while concurrently setting
up our manufacturing facility, beginning operations, and developing our business plan. We also continue to incur legal fees arising from
ongoing activities due to fundraising. We expect operating losses to continue in the short term, and we require additional financing
for expanding our manufacturing capability and generally scaling our business until we generate sufficient revenues to achieve positive
cash flow. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
have historically satisfied our working capital requirements through the sale of restricted common stock and the issuance of warrants
and promissory notes. We will continue our fundraising efforts until we have obtained positive cash flow to cover our expenses. No assurances
can be given that we will be successful in raising capital at all or on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and no assurances can be given
that even if we raise capital that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue to be cash flow positive. 

Notwithstanding
proceeds from the sale of our securities, a recent related party equipment lease transaction and warrant and option exercises in
2022 and 2023, the current working capital is very limited and our projected sales revenue (together with our limited working
capital) are presently insufficient to maintain our current operations. In order to grow our manufacturing and sales and marketing
operations and reach the level of revenue sufficient to provide positive cash flow, we require significant funding of both our
expansion plans (which includes the finalization of our current manufacturing expansion plans and potential investments in other
manufacturing facilities, as well as increased headcount necessary to operate our manufacturing at planned capacity) as well as our
significant operating deficit while we seeking to scale our manufacturing capability, secure orders from known potential customers
and introduce our products to new customers. We will attempt to raise this capital through third party financing, including
potential private or public offerings of our securities (including a potential underwritten offering and uplist to a national
exchange) as well as bridge or other loan arrangements. However, there is a material risk that we will be unable to secure the
required capital (whether through an underwritten uplist financing or otherwise) at all or that the terms of such required financing
may be available or acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing, we may reduce our operating activities to
reduce our cash use until sufficient funding is secured. If we are unable to secure funding when needed, our results of operations
may suffer, and our business may fail. 

Cash Flows 

Net
cash used in operating activities amounted to 1,114,570 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,147,896
for 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily a result of a decrease in operational activities. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we used 0 net cash for investing activities, respectively. 

We
do not believe that our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund our current working capital requirements to
the point where we are generating positive cash flow. We have recently entered into several convertible promissory notes to help fund
operations and will require additional working capital in the short term. We continue working towards securing more working capital with
a preference towards debt which may be convertible to equity. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts
or, if we are, that the terms will be beneficial to our shareholders. 

Critical Accounting
Estimates 

The
presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Please see note 2 to the condensed financial statements included in this report.

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Acting Interim Chief Executive Officer and our Acting Interim Chief
Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) through March 31, 2024. 

During
our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control as of March 31, 2024, management identified material weaknesses related to (i)
the U.S. GAAP expertise and experience of our internal accounting personnel and (ii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting
functions. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal controls were not effective as of September
30, 2024. 

We
are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that the material
weaknesses described above are remediated as soon as possible. We believe we will have the opportunity to remediate these weaknesses
when adequate funding is secured. We will consider the material weaknesses remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient
period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, however, readers are cautioned that internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Legal Matters 

From
time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. 

As
of the date of this report, the Company has filed a lawsuit in the state of South Carolina against Upstate Custom Products, LLC. The
lawsuit is based on the contract entered into by both parties in August 2021 in relation to the manufacturing of the protrusion machines
exclusively manufactured by Upstate Custom Products. LLC. As of this filing the lawsuit and claim for relief is ongoing. 

On or about October 2023, the Company
was served notice of a pending matter of litigation with GS Capital Partners of New York regarding the liquidated damages fees from the
2021 PIPE investment. This matter is presently pending in the New York Superior Court. As of this filing the matter remains unresolved. 

Due
to our cash flow and liquidity challenges, we have received demand letters from several vendors to our company seeking payment of past
due amounts to such vendors. As of the date of this report, such demands have not become formal litigations or other proceedings against
our company, but they may become litigations against us in the future. 

Except
as set forth above, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any proceedings pending against our company.
