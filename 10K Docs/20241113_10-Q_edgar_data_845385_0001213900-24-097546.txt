 Equity Total Total Level 3 Investments 

A Level 3 investment, valued at , was
an investment in a portfolio company that ceased operations in the second quarter of 2022. This value consisted of an estimate of remaining
cash available to distribute to priority lienholders. As a result, there were no unobservable inputs that have been internally developed
by the Company in determining the fair values of these investments as of December 31, 2023. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
the Company used a market approach to value certain equity investments as the Company felt this approach better reflected the fair value
of these investments. By considering multiple valuation approaches (and consequently, multiple valuation techniques), the valuation approaches
and techniques are not likely to change from one period of measurement to the next; however, the weighting of each in determining the
final fair value of a Level 3 investment may change based on recent events or transactions. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting
Policies for more detail. 

The Company considers all relevant information
that can reasonably be obtained when determining the fair value of Level 3 investments. Due to any given portfolio company s information
rights, changes in capital structure, recent events, transactions, or liquidity events, the type and availability of unobservable inputs
may change. Increases (decreases) in revenue multiples, earnings before interest and taxes EBIT multiples, time to expiration,
and stock price/strike price would result in higher (lower) fair values all else equal. Decreases (increases) in discount rates, volatility,
and annual risk rates, would result in higher (lower) fair values all else equal. The market approach utilizes market value (revenue and
EBIT) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Company
carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value its portfolio companies.
These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors,
as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. In general, precedent transactions include recent rounds of financing, recent
purchases made by the Company, and tender offers. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for more detail.

Overview 

We are an externally managed, non-diversified,
closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company BDC under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act or Investment Company Act ). While we have sought to invest primarily in
private small and lower middle-market companies in various industries, we are now (with a strategic alternatives process underway and
limited resources) investing only in current investments and otherwise conserving cash. Our investment objective is to maximize the total
return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments in private
small and lower middle-market companies. Since January 1, 2018, we have been managed by House Hanover, LLC House Hanover ). 

- 32 - 

As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other
than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total
assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. 
Under the relevant SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company includes all private companies, companies whose securities
are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities
exchange and have a market capitalization of less than 250 million, in each case organized in the United States. 

On November 15, 2019, our Board announced that
the Company has initiated a strategic review process to identify, examine, and consider a range of strategic alternatives available to
the Company, including but not limited to, (i) selling the Company s assets to a business development company or other potential
buyer, (ii) merging with another business development company, (iii) liquidating the Company s assets in accordance with a plan
of liquidation, (iv) raising additional funds for the Company, or (v) otherwise entering into another business combination, with the objective
of maximizing stockholder value. As of September 30, 2024 and through the date of filing this Quarterly Report, the Company has not entered
into any agreements regarding any strategic alternative. 

Corporate History 

In order to expedite the ramp-up of our investment
activities and further our ability to meet our investment objectives on March 13, 2015, we (i) acquired approximately 11.2 million in
cash, 43.5 million in equity and debt investments, and 1.9 million in restricted cash escrow deposits of Capital Point Partners, L.P. CPP and Capital Point Partners II, L.P. CPPII (together, the Partnerships ), and (ii) issued
approximately 115.5 million shares of our common stock based on a pre-valuation presumed fair value of 60.9 million and on a price of
approximately 0.53 per share. While we have sought to invest primarily in private small and lower middle-market companies in various
industries, we are now (with a strategic alternatives process underway and limited resources) investing only in current investments and
otherwise conserving cash. 

On an annual basis and in general, BDCs intend
to elect to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code ). To qualify as a RIC, a BDC must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification
requirements. As a RIC, BDCs generally will not have to pay corporate-level taxes on any income they distribute to their stockholders.
We did not meet the qualifications of a RIC for the 2023 tax year and will be taxed as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Code. Further,
we do not expect to meet the qualifications of a RIC until such time as certain strategic alternatives are achieved. 

Portfolio Composition and Investment Activity 

Portfolio Composition 

We originate and invest primarily in private small
and lower middle-market companies through first lien loans, second lien loans, unsecured loans, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing,
and corresponding equity investments. United States Treasury securities may be purchased and temporarily held in connection with complying
with RIC diversification requirements under Subchapter M of the Code. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had investments
in 4 portfolio companies. The total cost and fair value of the total investments were approximately 34.0 million and 21.3 million, respectively.

At September 30, 2024, our weighted average yield
of our portfolio investments, based upon cost and excluding non-yielding assets, was approximately 11.94 of which approximately 9.31 
is current cash interest, all bearing a fixed rate of interest except for one debt investment bearing interest at a variable rate. At
December 31, 2023, our weighted average yield based upon cost of our portfolio investments was approximately 11.86 of which approximately
10.23 is current cash interest. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we
held no United States Treasury securities. United States Treasury securities may be purchased and temporarily held in connection with
complying with RIC diversification requirements under Subchapter M of the Code. 

Investment Activity 

Our level of investment activity can vary substantially
from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital to middle market companies, the level
of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 

The primary portfolio investment activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 are as follows: 

On May 8, 2024, the Company entered into a loan agreement
with PCC SBH Sub, Inc. to loan up to 100,000 in advances as the Company sees fit for operating capital. Any funds advanced will accrue
interest at the rate of 10 for the first year of the agreement, then interest only will be payable quarterly in arrears. The agreement
has a maturity date of May 8, 2026 and is secured by a first lien on all entity assets. 

On May 10, 2024, the Company advanced 15,000 under its loan
agreement with PCC SBH Sub, Inc. 

On June 27, 2024, the Company received a final distribution
in the amount of 192,932 of the remaining funds in Dominion Medical Management, Inc. Dominion ). This amount will be applied
to the Company s first lien loan to Dominion. The Company will take a capital loss for any remaining balance in its first lien
loan to Dominion and to any equity investments in Integrated Medical Partners, LLC. 

On August 19, 2024, the Company advanced 50,000 under its
loan agreement with PCC SBH Sub, Inc.

Asset Quality 

In addition to various risk management and monitoring
tools, our investment advisor used an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the quality of our debt investment portfolio.
Equity securities and Treasury Bills are not graded. This debt investment rating system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following
is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 

Investment Rating 
 
 Summary Description 

1 
 
 Investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. 

2 
 
 Investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans will initially be rated 2. 

3 
 
 Investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants. 

4 
 
 Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 will be those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected. 

5 
 
 Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected. 

The following table shows the investment ratings
of our debt investments at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Loans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status 

We will not accrue interest on loans and debt
securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2 loans on non-accrual status.
As of December 31, 2023, we had 3 loans on non-accrual status. 

Results of Operations 

An important measure of our financial performance
is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss)
and net change in unrealized gain (loss). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends,
fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gain (loss) on investments
is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net change in unrealized
gain (loss) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. 

Revenues 

We generate revenue in the form of interest income
on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies.
Our debt investments typically have a term of five to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on our debt
securities is generally payable quarterly. Payments of principal on our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the
investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments may pay interest in-kind, or PIK.
Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity
date. The level of interest income we receive is directly related to the balance of interest-bearing investments multiplied by the weighted
average yield of our investments. We expect that the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase as the
size of our investment portfolio increases. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, loan origination,
structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees. These fees will be reorganized
as they are earned.

reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded appreciation
or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 

Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments
totaled a loss of (3,037,038) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to gains of 1,342,745 and 4,226,523 on Dominion

LLC and Rockfish Seafood Grill, Inc., respectively. 

Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments
totaled a loss of (75,266) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a gain of 1,259,626 on Advantis Certified Staffing
Solutions, Inc. which was offset by losses of (587,373) and (630,399) on Performance Alloys, LLC and Rockfish Seafood Grill, Inc., respectively. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

We intend to continue to generate cash from future
offerings of securities and cash flows from operations, including earnings on investments in our portfolio and future investments, as
well as interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that
mature in one year or less. We may, if permitted by regulation, seek various forms of leverage and borrow funds to make investments. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,438,998 in
cash and cash equivalents and 32,759 in restricted cash, and our net assets totaled 23,125,404. We believe that our anticipated cash
flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations for at least the next twelve months. 

Contractual Obligations 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any
contractual obligations that would trigger the tabular disclosure of contractual obligations under Section 303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K. 

We have entered into one contract under which
we have material future commitments, the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which House Hanover serves as our investment
adviser. Payments under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement in future periods will be equal to a percentage of the value of
our net assets. 

The House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement
is terminable by either party without penalty upon written notice by the Company or 60 days written notice by House Hanover. If
this agreement is terminated, the costs we incur under a new agreement may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time
and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our investment advisory agreement. Any
new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders. 

Distributions 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, no dividends have been declared or distributed to stockholders. 

In order to qualify as a RIC and to avoid U.S.
federal corporate level income tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our
net ordinary income and our net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders on an
annual basis. Additionally, we must distribute an amount at least equal to the sum of 98 of our net ordinary income (during the calendar
year) plus 98.2 of our net capital gain income (during each 12-month period ending on October 31) plus any net ordinary income and capital
gain net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax to avoid
a U.S. federal excise tax. To the extent that we have income available, we intend to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders.
Our stockholder distributions, if any, will be determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis. Any distribution to our stockholders
will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. The Company did not meet the requirements to qualify as a RIC for the
2023 tax year and will be taxed as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Code. It may not be in the best interests of the Company s
stockholders to elect to be taxed as a RIC at the present time due to the net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards the Company
currently has. Management will make a determination that is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. While the Company
does not expect to meet the qualifications of a RIC until such time as certain strategic alternatives are achieved, it can still declare
a dividend even though it is not required to do so. 

- 39 - 

We may not be able to achieve operating results
that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition,
we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940
Act. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we could suffer adverse tax consequences, including the possible
failure to qualify as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions. 

To the extent our taxable earnings fall below
the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our
stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital
invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying any stockholder
distribution carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or capital gains. 

At the initial meeting of the Board of Directors
(the Board held on March 13, 2015, the Board adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common
stockholders. On October 17, 2022, the Board terminated the opt out dividend reinvestment plan, as disclosed in the Company s
8-K filed on October 19, 2022. Written notice of such termination was mailed to the Company s stockholders on October 21, 2022,
with an effective date of November 20, 2022. As a result, any distributions declared for stockholders of record after November 20, 2022,
will be paid in cash. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Inc. Advantis requested one of its directors, Gregory J. Cannella who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, become
the Executive Chair of Advantis to provide executive authority and leadership in the absence of their former president, who resigned in
March 2022. Mr. Cannella has agreed to take this position and in return will be compensated by Advantis in the amount of 5,000 per month.
The title and benefits of this position can be removed at any time by the board of directors of Advantis.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 2 of the financial statements for a description
of recent accounting pronouncements, if any, including the expected dates of adoption and the anticipated impact on the financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of our financial statements and
related disclosures in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment,
financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the
discussion below, our significant accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements. 

Valuation of Portfolio Investments 

As a BDC, we generally invest in illiquid loans
and securities including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our board of directors,
we value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an
independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available,
otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market
prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. Such determination of
fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates, although we engage independent valuation providers to review the valuation
of each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available market quotation quarterly. Investments purchased within 60 days of
maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximate fair value. With respect to unquoted
securities, our board of directors values each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons
of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors, which are provided by a nationally recognized independent valuation
firm. This valuation firm provides a range of values for selected investments, which is presented to the Valuation Committee to determine
the value for each of the selected investments. 

When an external event such as a purchase transaction,
public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, our board of directors uses the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate
and/or assist us in our valuation. Because there is not a readily available market for substantially all of the investments in our portfolio,
we value our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a documented valuation policy
and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not
have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been
used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily
available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 

Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio
company or investment being initially valued by an independent valuation firm, except for those investments where market quotations are
readily available; 

Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and
discussed with our senior management, our investment advisor, and our auditors; 

The valuation committee of our board of directors then reviews
these preliminary valuations and approves them for recommendation to the board of directors; 

The board of directors then discusses valuations and determines
the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our investment advisor, the independent valuation
firm and the valuation committee. 

- 41 - 

Revenue Recognition 

Realized gain (loss) on the sale of investments
is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their stated costs. Realized gains or losses
on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method. 

Interest income, adjusted for amortization of
premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and
debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally
becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible.
Generally, we will not accrue interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan
origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we then accrete or amortize such amounts
using the effective interest method as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination
is recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 

Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on
the ex-dividend date. 

Generally, when a payment default occurs on a
loan in the portfolio, or if the Company otherwise believes that the borrower will not be able to make contractual interest payments,
the Company may place the loan on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on the loan until all principal and interest
is current through payment, or until a restructuring occurs, and the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The Company may make
exceptions to this policy if a loan has sufficient collateral value, is in the process of collection or is viewed to be able to pay all
amounts due if the loan were to be collected on through an investment in or sale of the business, the sale of the assets of the business,
or some portion or combination thereof. 

Recent Developments 

On October 9, 2024, the deposit held for by the
law firm representing the Company in its litigation with Great Value Storage, LLC was returned in the amount of 27,758. 

Other than the event listed above, subsequent
to the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and through the date of this filing, there was no portfolio activity or other events to report.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are subject to financial market risks, including
credit risk, illiquidity of investments in our portfolio and changes in interest rates. 

Credit risk is the primary market risk associated
with our business. Credit risk originates from the fact that some of our portfolio companies may become unable or unwilling to fulfill
their contractual payment obligations to us and may eventually default on those obligations. These contractual payment obligations arise
under the debt securities and other investments that we hold. They include payment of interest, principal, dividends, fees and payments
under guarantees and similar instruments. 

We primarily invest in illiquid debt and other
securities of small and mid-sized private companies. In some cases these investments include additional equity components. Our investments
may have no established trading market or are generally subject to restrictions on resale. The illiquidity of our investments may adversely
affect our ability to dispose of debt and equity securities at times when it may be otherwise advantageous for us to liquidate such investments.
As of September 30, 2024, all of our debt investments are fixed rate. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and accumulated and communicated to management, including our Interim
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (September 30, 2024), we performed
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b)
and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance (i) that
information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No changes to our internal control over financial
reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
