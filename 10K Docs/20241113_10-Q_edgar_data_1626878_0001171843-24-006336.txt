million in cash and up to million in potential milestone payments (the Janssen Transaction ). The potential milestone payments are contingent upon achieving the required commercialization authorization for a product intended for use in any non-dermatological indication by Janssen within twelve years. As part of the Janssen Transaction, XBiotech maintained the right to develop new antibodies that block IL-1a and develop these therapeutics in all areas of medicine except dermatology. Moreover, Janssen agreed that they would assert all patents they acquired relating to IL-1a for the benefit of XBiotech to protect our future IL-1a-related therapies in all non-dermatological indications. XBiotech is using its True Human antibody discovery technology to identify and develop new IL-1a targeting product candidates and has already brought one such candidate into clinical studies in oncology and rheumatology; and another unique anti-IL-1a antibody into a Phase I study in neurology. 

The Company continues to be subject to a number of risks common to companies in similar stages of development. Principal among these risks are the uncertainties of technological innovations, dependence on key individuals, development of the same or similar technological innovations by the Company s competitors and protection of proprietary technology. The Company s ability to fund its planned clinical operations, including completion of its planned trials, is expected to depend on the amount and timing of cash receipts from future collaboration or product sales and/or financing transactions. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents of million at September 30, 2024, will enable the Company to achieve several major inflection points, including potential new clinical studies with lead product candidates. The Company expects to have sufficient cash through at least 12 months from the date of this report. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 contains financial information taken from the audited XBiotech Inc. consolidated financial statements as of that date. 

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates for the years and jurisdictions in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered. A change to the tax rates used to measure the Company s deferred taxes is recognized in income during the period in which the new rate(s) were enacted. 

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent the Company s assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, tax-planning strategies, taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted under tax law, and the results from prior years. If the Company determines it is more likely than not, that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded with a charge to income tax expense. Alternatively, if the Company determines that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset previously not meeting the more likely than not threshold will be realized, the Company reduces its valuation allowance and recognizes a benefit in income tax expense. 

The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax benefits in accordance with ASC 740 based on a two-step process in which (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, in income tax expense.

million in immediate funding for the construction of a new, state-of-the-art research and development facility at the Company s property at 5217 Winnebago Lane in Austin, Texas. The Loan is secured by the real estate and cash holdings of the Company, with interest to accrue at a simple rate equal to eight percent per year and interest-only payments to be made at six-month intervals. At Mr. Simard s election, the balance may be converted to XBiotech stock at any time the Loan balance is outstanding at a fixed conversion price equal to per share. The conversion feature is subject to a cap limiting the number of shares that could be converted under the Loan based on Mr. Simard s total stock ownership in the Company at the time of conversion. The Loan includes an acceleration feature, allowing Mr. Simard to declare immediate cash repayment or conversion under specific acceleration events, including certain financial and non-financial measures, such as payment defaults, breaches of covenants, drop in stock price below per share or drop in cash position below . The Loan also allows Mr. Simard to obtain immediate cash repayment of the Loan balance at his election one year after the loan is funded or upon certain other conditions set forth in the Loan. The Loan has a contractual maturity date of January 3, 2029. The Loan was negotiated, evaluated, and approved on behalf of the Company by a committee of independent and disinterested directors.

Item 2. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

XBiotech Inc. XBiotech or the Company) is a pre-market biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering and developing True Human monoclonal antibodies for treating a variety of diseases. True Human monoclonal antibodies are those which occur naturally in human beings as opposed to being derived from animal immunization or otherwise engineered. We believe that naturally occurring monoclonal antibodies have the potential to be safer and more effective than their non-naturally occurring counterparts. XBiotech is focused on developing its True Human pipeline and manufacturing system. 

Following the Janssen Transaction in December 2019, the tender offer in February 2020, and the dividends paid in July 2021, the accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was 80.3) million. We had net losses before income tax of 5.0 million and 28.0 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 7.1 million and 19.6 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the next year, we don t expect any revenues. In addition, we expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical testing and clinical. In addition to these increasing research and development expenses, we expect general and administrative costs to increase, particularly in consideration of current inflationary trends. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve or sustain profitability, and we may never do so. As of September 30, 2024, we had 92 employees. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with identifying and developing our drug candidates. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, stock-based compensation, the purchase of equipment, laboratory and manufacturing supplies, facility costs, costs for preclinical and clinical research, development of quality control systems, quality assurance programs and manufacturing processes. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. 

The clinical development costs may further increase going forward with potentially more advanced studies in the future as we evaluate our clinical data and pipeline. 

Clinical development timelines, likelihood of success and total costs vary widely. We do not currently track our internal research and development costs or our personnel and related costs on an individual drug candidate basis. We use our research and development resources, including employees and our drug discovery technology, across multiple drug development programs. As a result, we cannot state precisely the costs incurred for each of our research and development programs or our clinical and preclinical drug candidates. From inception through September 30, 2024, we have recorded total research and development expenses, including share-based compensation, of 303.7 million. Our total research and development expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.1 million and 29.9 million, respectively, compared to 7.5 million and 25.05 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation related to research and development accounted for 0.2 million and 0.7 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.8 million and 2.2 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Research and development expenses, as a percentage of total operating expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 90 and 89 , respectively, compared to 89 and 87 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The percentages of research and development expenses compared to total operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation, for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 91 and 90 , respectively, compared to 89 and 87 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

20

We will select drug candidates and research projects for further development on an ongoing basis in response to their preclinical and clinical success and commercial potential. For research and development candidates in early stages of development, it is premature to estimate when material net cash inflows from these projects might occur. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in administrative, finance, business development, and human resource functions, as well as the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property and patent filing, maintenance expenses, share based compensation, and professional fees for legal services. Our total general and administration expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.8 million and 3.8 million, respectively, compared to 1.0 million and 3.9 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation related to general and administration accounted for 0.1 million and 0.7 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 0.1 million and 0.4 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total operating expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 10 and 11 , respectively, compared to 11 and 13 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The percentages of general and administrative expense compared to total operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation, for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 9 and 10 , respectively, compared to 11 and 13 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and expenses incurred during the reported periods. 

We base estimates on our historical experience, known trends and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized, and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction. To date, with the exception of certain Canada deferred tax assets that will reverse in a period in which they may be carried back, we have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we believe the objective and verifiable evidence of our historical pretax net losses outweighs any positive evidence of our forecasted future results. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment. We will continue to monitor the positive and negative evidence and will adjust the valuation allowance as sufficient objective positive evidence becomes available. 

21

We account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions within our global operations in income tax expense. 

Clinical Trial Accruals 

Expense accruals related to clinical trials are based on actual services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with third party service providers which conduct and manage clinical trials on the Company s behalf. The financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. The Company accrues costs based on the actual services rendered in the period over which services were performed and the level of effort expended in each period based upon patient enrollment, clinical site activations, or information provided to the Company by its vendors on their actual costs incurred. Any estimates of the level of services performed or the costs of these services could differ from actual results.

We do not currently track our internal research and development costs or our personnel and related costs on an individual drug candidate basis. We use our research and development resources, including employees and our drug discovery technology, across multiple drug development programs. As a result, we cannot state precisely the costs incurred for each of our research and development programs or our clinical and preclinical drug candidates.

Research and development expenses decreased 0.4 million to 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of in share-based compensation, which was due to the decreased stock option expense per share of new grants compared to the expense of fully amortized grants. Clinical trials and sponsored research expense decreased because of one study fully completed in the second quarter of 2024. 

Research and development expenses increased 4.9 million to 29.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the rise in the clinical trial activities, related to the new study being initiated in the second quarter of 2023. The increase of salaries and related expenses was mainly due to a company-wide bonus distributed in January 2024 and the bonus to the Chief Executive Officer. In addition, there is a decrease in share-based compensation, which was due to the decreased stock option expense per share of new grants compared to the expense of fully amortized grants.

General and administrative expenses decreased 196 thousand to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses decreased 92 thousand to 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The three months decrease was primarily due to the decrease of professional fees, related to the stock service and the tax service. 

Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in the general and administrative expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also primarily caused by the service fees associated with the tender offer in June 2023 and tax service. The increase of salaries and related expenses was due to a company-wide bonus distributed in January 2024 and the bonus to the Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the patent filing expense increased mainly due to the transfer of patents from Janssen to XBiotech.

The interest income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was from the interest generated from the Company s Canadian bank account and interest bearing time deposit. The interest expense for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was the interest for the related party convertible loan. In June 2023, the Company received a sum of 750 thousand from American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC which was recorded as other income, in accordance with the terms outlined in the settlement agreement. Foreign exchange gain (loss) was mainly due to the fluctuation between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash requirements could change materially as a result of the progress of our research and development and clinical programs, licensing activities, acquisitions, divestitures or other corporate developments. 

Since our inception on March 22, 2005, we have funded our operations principally through private placements and public offerings of equity securities, which have provided aggregate cash proceeds of approximately 118.4 million as of September 30, 2024. We received 675 million in cash proceeds from the Janssen Transaction in the year ended December 31, 2019. In June 2021, we received the remaining 75 million in cash from the escrow receivable from the same transaction. In July 2021, we paid 75 million in dividends to shareholders. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 183.1 million as compared to cash and cash equivalents of 202.2 million at September 30, 2023. The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash (in thousands):

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating activities used net cash of 24.4 million and 15.2 million, respectively. The use of net cash in each of these periods primarily resulted from our net losses. The increase in net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was mainly due to the increase in salaries and related expenses and clinical trial expense. 

24

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our investing activities used net cash of 1.2 million and generated net cash of 61.6 million, respectively. In July 2022, we purchased interest bearing time deposits in the amount of 59.5 million. Upon maturity in July 2023, we obtained both the principal amount and the accrued interest. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our financing activities provided net cash of 10.2 million. On January 3, 2024, we entered into a Convertible Loan Agreement (the Loan with John Simard, the Company s Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, which provided 10 million net cash for the construction of a new, state-of-the-art research and development facility at the Company's property at 5217 Winnebago Lane in Austin, Texas. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, employees exercised stock options to purchase 42,442 shares of our common stock for approximately 167 thousand in net proceeds. On June 20, 2023, we used approximately 14 thousand to purchase 3,561 common shares at a price of 4.00 per share, relating to the tender offer completed in June 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, employees exercised stock options to purchase 1,250 shares of our common stock for approximately 5 thousand in net proceeds. 

We expect to continue to incur operating losses in the future. We do not expect to receive any additional revenue under the clinical manufacturing agreement with Janssen. Further, we may not receive any product revenue until a drug candidate has been approved by the FDA, EMA or similar regulatory agencies in other countries and successfully commercialized. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents, which totaled approximately 183.1 million. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Since inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet activities, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. 

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

The Company has no need to hedge against any of the foregoing risks and therefore currently engages in no hedging activities. 

Item 4. 

Controls and Procedures 

Management's Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Director of Finance (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Director of Finance (Principal Financial Officer) concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or furnishes under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations, and are operating in an effective manner. 

25

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
