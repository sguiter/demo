F or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized amortization expense of the fair value of its stock options, which is included in General and administrative expenses, as follows: Restricted Stock Units The Company has granted restricted stock units RSUs under the Company s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2015 Plan ), to certain members of the Board of Directors and certain executives and employees of the Company, which represent the right to receive a share of common stock, or in the sole discretion of the Company s Compensation Committee, the value of a share of common stock on the date that the RSU vests. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and shares of the Company s common stock were outstanding in respect of the RSUs, respectively. Such shares will only be issued in respect to vested RSUs issued to directors when the director s service with the Company as a director terminates. Such shares of common stock will only be issued to executives and employees when their RSUs vest under the terms of their grant agreements and the 2015 Plan. The RSUs that have been issued to certain members of the Board of Directors generally vest on the date of the annual shareholders meeting of the Company following the date of the grant. In lieu of cash dividends issued for vested and nonvested shares held by certain members of the Board of Directors, the Company will grant additional vested and nonvested RSUs, respectively, which are calculated by dividing the amount of the dividend by the closing price per share of the Company s common stock on the dividend payment date and will have the same terms as other RSUs issued to members of the Board of Directors. The RSUs that have been issued to other individuals vest in equal installments on each of the anniversaries of the determined vesting date, over the three or vesting periods, as applicable.

The total fair value is calculated as the number of shares vested during the period multiplied by the fair value on the vesting date. The Company is amortizing these grants over the applicable vesting periods, net of anticipated forfeitures. As of September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation cost of related to RSUs will be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized nonvested stock amortization expense for the RSUs, which is included in General and administrative expenses as follows: Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units The Company has granted performance-based restricted stock units PRSUs under the 2015 Plan to certain employees of the Company, some of which are contingent upon the Company s relative total shareholder return TSR and some of which are contingent upon the Company s return on invested capital ROIC for a performance period ending December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2026. The TSR is calculated based on the Company s total shareholder return compared to that of certain peer companies specified in the award agreements over the performance period and is calculated based on the change in the average daily closing stock price over a trading-day period from the beginning to the end of the performance period, including reinvested dividends. The total quantity of PRSUs eligible to vest under these awards range from to of the target based on actual relative TSR performance during the performance period. The grant date fair value of the TSR awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation for these awards, which are subject to market conditions, is being amortized over the service period.

As such, ROIC awards are subject to performance conditions and compensation cost is recognized over the service period based on the amount of awards that the Company believes is probable that will vest. To the extent the Company s estimate changes, the Company will recognize a cumulative catch up in subsequent reporting periods. The table below summarizes the Company s unvested PRSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: Granted Vested Forfeited Outstanding as of September 30, 2024 The PRSUs, if earned, will ordinarily vest during the first quarter after the performance period and the recipient will receive a share of common stock for each earned PRSU.

Table of Contents 
 General We are a New York City-based company incorporated in the Marshall Islands that transports iron ore, coal, grain, steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk vessels. Our fleet currently consists of 42 drybulk vessels, including 16 Capesize, 15 Ultramax and eleven Supramax vessels, with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 4,446,000 deadweight tons dwt and an average age of approximately 11.9 years. We seek to deploy our vessels on time charters, spot market voyage charters, spot market-related time charters or in vessel pools trading in the spot market, to reputable charterers. See pages 35 - 36 for a table of our current fleet. Our approach towards fleet composition is to own a high-quality fleet of vessels focused on Capesize, Ultramax and Supramax vessels. Capesize vessels represent our major bulk vessel category, while Ultramax and Supramax vessels represent our minor bulk vessel category. Our major bulk vessels are primarily used to transport iron ore, coal and bauxite, while our minor bulk vessels are primarily used to transport grains, steel products and other drybulk cargoes such as cement, scrap, fertilizer, nickel ore, salt and sugar. This approach of owning ships that transport both major and minor bulk commodities provide us with exposure to a wide range of drybulk trade flows. We employ an active commercial strategy which consists of a global team located in the U.S., Copenhagen and Singapore. Overall, we utilize a portfolio approach to revenue generation through a combination of short-term, spot market employment, index-linked time charters as well as opportunistically booking longer term fixed-rate coverage. Our fleet deployment strategy currently is weighted towards short-term fixtures, which provides us with optionality on our sizeable fleet. However, depending on market conditions, we may seek to enter into additional longer term time charters or contracts of affreightment. In addition to both short and long-term time charters, we fix our vessels on spot market voyage charters as well as spot market-related time charters depending on market conditions and management s outlook. Our approach to capital allocation, through our comprehensive value strategy, focuses on three key factors: Compelling dividends, Financial deleveraging, and Accretive growth of our fleet Since 2021, we have executed this strategy by reducing our debt by 369.2 million cumulatively through September 30, 2024 while expanding our core Capesize and Ultramax fleet. This has resulted in a debt balance of 80.0 million as of September 30, 2024, a 82 reduction from January 1, 2021 levels. These actions have enabled us to further reduce our cash flow breakeven rate positioning us to pay sizeable quarterly dividends across diverse market environments. After a drawdown of 20.0 million on October 10, 2024 to partially fund the purchase of the Genco Intrepid, a 2016-built Capesize vessel that was delivered on October 23, 2024, our debt balance increased to 100.0 million. In addition to the 47.0 million of cash on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, we currently have undrawn revolver availability after the 20.0 million drawdown of 313.0 million, bringing our current total liquidity to 360.0 million. Furthermore, since the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2024, we have declared cumulative dividends under our value strategy of 5.26 per share. IMO 2023 Compliance In 2021, Genco initiated a plan to comply with upcoming International Maritime Organization IMO regulations that took effect in 2023, namely the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index EEXI and the Carbon Intensity Indicator CII metrics, which call for a reduction in vessel greenhouse gas emissions. These metrics are intended to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and these new regulations set required attainment values, with the goal of reducing the carbon intensity of international shipping.

 We have invested and plan to continue to invest in energy conservation programs to install various energy-saving devices, or ESDs, high performance paint systems, upgrade propellers among other initiatives on select vessels in our fleet. We began installing these ESDs on certain ships that entered drydocking in 2022, and we plan to continue to invest in our fleet. IMO 2030 to 2050 Guidelines In July 2023, the Marine Environment Protection Committee, a sub-committee of the IMO, focused on medium to long term decarbonization targets for the shipping industry. New targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions as compared to 2008 levels are below which are to be reviewed every five years: 2030: 20 reduction while striving for 30 2040: 70 reduction while striving for 80 2050: net zero at or around 2050 Vessel Sales and Acquisitions On October 3, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Genco Intrepid, a 2016-built 180,000 dwt Capesize vessel, for a purchase price of 47.5 million. The vessel was delivered on October 23, 2024. We drew down 20 million on our 500 Million Revolver during the fourth quarter of 2024 and utilized cash on hand to finance the purchase. On October 10, 2023 and November 14, 2023, we entered into agreements to acquire two 2016-built 181,000 dwt Capesize vessels, the Genco Ranger and Genco Reliance, respectively. The purchase price of the Genco Ranger and Genco Reliance were 43.1 million and 43.0 million, respectively, and the vessels were delivered on November 27, 2023 and November 21, 2023, respectively. We drew down a total of 65 million on our revolving credit facility under the 450 Million Credit Facility during the fourth quarter of 2023 and utilized cash on hand to finance the purchases. In order to opportunistically renew our fleet, in addition to the above vessel purchases, we agreed to divest three older, less fuel efficient vessels with their third special survey due in 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into agreements to sell three of our Capesize vessels, the Genco Commodus, the Genco Claudius and the Genco Maximus. The sale of these vessels were completed on February 7, 2024, April 22, 2024 and April 2, 2024, respectively. Additionally, on May 21, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell the Genco Warrior, a 2005-built Supramax vessel, for 11.95 million less a 3.0 commission payable to a third-party and the sale was completed on July 5, 2024. Also, on July 16, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell the Genco Hadrian, a 2008-built Capesize vessel, for 25.0 million less a 2.0 commission payable to a third-party and the sale was completed on October 4, 2024. We will continue to seek opportunities to renew our fleet going forward. Our Operations We report financial information and evaluate our operations by charter revenues and not by the length of ship employment for our customers, i.e., spot or time charters. Each of our vessels serves the same type of customer, has similar operations and maintenance requirements, operates in the same regulatory environment, and is subject to similar economic characteristics. Based on this, we have determined that we operate in one reportable segment in which we are engaged in the ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels.

 Our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet. Commercial management includes the negotiation of charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time charters, spot market voyage charters and spot market-related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters. Strategic management includes locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels. Technical management involves the day-to-day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies. Our technical management joint venture, GS Shipmanagement Pte. Ltd. GSSM ), and Synergy Marine Pte. Ltd. currently provide the technical management to the vessels in our fleet and members of our New York City-based management team oversee their activities.

(1) Ownership days . We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period. (2) Chartered-in days . We define chartered-in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which we chartered-in third-party vessels. (3) Available days (owned and chartered-in fleet) . We define available days as the number of our ownership days and chartered-in days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to familiarization upon acquisition, repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys. Companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. (4) Available days (owned fleet). We define available days for the owned fleet as available days less chartered-in days. 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 (5) Operating days . We define operating days as the number of our total available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues. (6) Fleet utilization . We calculate fleet utilization as the number of our operating days during a period divided by the number of ownership days plus chartered-in days less drydocking days. (7) Time charter equivalent . We define time charter equivalent TCE rates as our voyage revenues less voyage expenses, charter-hire expenses and realized gains or losses on fuel hedges, divided by the number of the available days of our owned fleet during the period. TCE rate is not an item recognized by U.S. GAAP (i.e., it is a non-GAAP measure). However, it is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts.

(1) EBITDA represents net income (loss) attributable to Genco Shipping Trading Limited plus net interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is included because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance. EBITDA is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers. Our management uses EBITDA as a performance measure in our consolidated internal financial statements, and it is presented for review at our board meetings. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors as the shipping industry is capital intensive which often results in significant depreciation and cost of financing. EBITDA presents investors with a measure in addition to net income to evaluate our performance prior to these costs. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other indicator of a company s operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The definition of EBITDA used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies. The following table demonstrates our calculation of EBITDA and provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Genco Shipping Trading Limited for each of the periods presented above:

 (1) The charter expiration dates presented represent the earliest dates that our charters may be terminated in the ordinary course. Under the terms of certain contracts, the charterer is entitled to extend the time charter from two to four months in order to complete the vessel's final voyage plus any time the vessel has been off-hire. (2) Time charter rates presented are the gross daily charterhire rates before third-party brokerage commission generally ranging from 1.25 to 6.25 . In a time charter, the charterer is responsible for voyage expenses such as bunkers, port expenses, agents fees and canal dues. (3) BCI is the Baltic Capesize Index (4) Represents the annualized daily rate. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 VOYAGE REVENUES- For the three months ended September 30, 2024, voyage revenues increased by 16.0 million, or 19.2 , to 99.3 million as compared to 83.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in voyage revenues was primarily due to higher rates earned by our major and minor bulk vessels, partially offset by a decrease related to the operation of a smaller fleet. In the third quarter of 2024, the drybulk market remained at firm levels led by increased Brazilian iron ore exports, as well as solid coal and bauxite trades together with continued commodity demand from China. The average TCE rate of our overall fleet increased 59.4 to 19,260 a day during the third quarter of 2024 from 12,082 a day during the third quarter of 2023. The TCE for our major bulk vessels increased by 74.7 from 15,424 a day during the third quarter of 2023 to 26,951 a day during the third quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily a result of higher rates achieved by our Capesize vessels. The TCE for our minor bulk vessels increased by 41.9 from 10,296 a day during the third quarter of 2023 to 14,608 a day during the third quarter of 2024 primarily a result of higher rates achieved by our Ultramax and Supramax vessels. 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 Total ownership days decreased from 4,048.0 during the third quarter of 2023 to 3,868.3 during the third quarter of 2024 due to the sale of three Capesize vessels and one Supramax vessels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by the delivery of two Capesize vessels during the fourth quarter of 2023. Fleet utilization increased marginally from 97.7 during the third quarter of 2023 to 97.9 during the third quarter of 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2025, we expect approximately 580 days of offhire related to scheduled drydockings and special surveys. Refer to Capital Expenditures section below for further details. VOYAGE EXPENSES- In time charters and spot market-related time charters, operating costs including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel and specified voyage costs such as fuel and port charges are paid by the charterer. These expenses are borne by the Company during spot market voyage charters. There are certain other non-specified voyage expenses such as commissions, which are typically borne by us. Voyage expenses include port and canal charges, fuel (bunker) expenses and brokerage commissions payable to unaffiliated third parties. Port and canal charges and bunker expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on spot market voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessel owner. At the inception of a time charter, we record the difference between the cost of bunker fuel delivered by the terminating charterer and the bunker fuel sold to the new charterer as a gain or loss within voyage expenses. Voyage expenses also include the cost of bunkers consumed during short-term time charters pursuant to the terms of the time charter agreement. Additionally, we may record lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments to re-value the bunker fuel on a quarterly basis for certain time charter agreements where the inventory is subject to gains and losses. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Voyage expenses decreased from 34.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 28.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower voyage expenses for our major bulk vessels, including lower bunker consumption, as the major bulk vessels were fixed on fewer spot voyages during three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . VESSEL OPERATING EXPENSES- Vessel operating expenses increased marginally by 0.1 million from 24.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Average daily vessel operating expenses DVOE for our fleet increased to 6,423 per vessel per day for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6,113 per day for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in daily vessel operating expense was primarily due to the timing of the purchase of stores and higher repair and maintenance costs. We believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation. The DVOE budget for the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to be 6,200 per vessel per day on a fleet-wide basis. The potential impacts of various macroeconomic events, including but not limited to the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war and the Houthi conflict in the Red Sea, are unpredictable, and the actual amount of our DVOE could be higher or lower than budgeted as a result. Our vessel operating expenses increase to the extent our fleet expands. Other factors beyond our control, some of which may affect the shipping industry in general, including, for instance, developments relating to market prices for crewing, lubes, and insurance, may also cause these expenses to increase. Crew costs on our vessels could increase in the future due to higher wages as a result of the potential impact of the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, and the Houthi conflict in the Red Sea among other potential macroeconomic events, are unpredictable, and the actual amount of our DVOE could be higher or lower than budgeted as a result.

 CHARTER HIRE EXPENSES- Charter hire expenses decreased by 0.7 million from 2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in chartered-in days, partially offset by an increase in hire rates. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES- We incur general and administrative expenses that relate to our onshore non-vessel-related activities. Our general and administrative expenses include our payroll expenses, including those relating to our executive officers, operating lease expense, legal, auditing and other professional expenses. General and administrative expenses include nonvested stock amortization expense which represent the amortization of stock-based compensation that has been issued to our Directors and employees pursuant to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. Refer to Note 13 Stock-Based Compensation in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. General and administrative expenses also include legal and professional fees associated with our credit facilities, which are not capitalizable to deferred financing costs. We also incur general and administrative expenses for our overseas offices located in Singapore and Copenhagen. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses increased from 6.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to higher nonvested stock amortization expense. TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT EXPENSES- Technical management expenses include the direct costs incurred by GSSM for the technical management of the vessels under its management. Technical management expenses were 1.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION- Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 0.4 million to 16.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense as a result of the operation of a smaller fleet during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in vessel deprecation expense was partially offset by an increase in drydocking amortization expense for certain vessels that completed their respective drydockings during 2023. IMPAIRMENT OF VESSEL ASSETS- During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 1.0 million of losses related to the disposal of replaced equipment on certain vessels. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 28.1 million of impairment expense for three of our Capesize vessels. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of these vessels. NET GAIN ON SALE OF VESSELS- During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a net gain on sale of vessels of 4.5 million related primarily to the sale of the Genco Warrior during the third quarter of 2024. There were no vessels sold during the third quarter of 2023.

 OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME - INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased from 2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of interest expense under our credit facilities and amortization of deferred financing costs for those facilities. The increase was primarily a result of lower settlement payments received under our interest rate cap agreements as a result of the expiration of these agreements. There were no interest rate cap agreements during the third quarter of 2024. This increase was partially offset by a decrease due to lower outstanding debt during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. INTEREST INCOME Interest income increased by 0.1 million from 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. OTHER EXPENSE Other expense increased marginally by 0.1 million from 0.1 million during three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 0.1 million which is associated with the net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest of GSSM. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 VOYAGE REVENUES- For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, voyage revenues increased by 55.5 million, or 20.7 , to 323.8 million as compared to 268.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in voyage revenues was primarily due to higher rates earned by our major bulk vessels and our Ultramax vessels that are in the minor bulk fleet. Refer to the discussion above included under the section Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 Voyage Revenues for further information. The average TCE rate of our overall fleet increased 40.4 to 19,458 a day during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 13,855 a day during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The TCE for our major bulk vessels increased by 60.2 from 16,954 a day during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 27,160 a day during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily a result of higher rates achieved by our Capesize vessels. The TCE for our minor bulk vessels increased by 22.9 from 11,872 a day during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14,594 a day during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily a result of higher rates achieved by our Ultramax and Supramax vessels. Fleet utilization decreased from 97.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 96.8 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to additionally offhire days for our Capesize vessels. VOYAGE EXPENSES- Voyage expenses were 95.7 million and 100.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in voyage expenses was primarily due to a decrease in voyage expenses for our Supramax vessels, part of our minor bulk vessels, including a decrease in bunker consumption as well as lower overall 

 39 

Table of Contents 
 voyage expenses primarily due to the vessels being fixed on fewer spot voyages during the nine month ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period during 2023 . This decrease was partially offset by an increase in voyage expenses for our major bulk vessels primarily due to higher bunker consumption resulting from the vessels being fixed on more spot voyages during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period during 2023. VESSEL OPERATING EXPENSES- Vessel operating expenses increased by 6.1 million from 71.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 77.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the timing of the purchase of stores and spares, higher crew costs, and higher repair and maintenance costs. DVOE for our fleet increased to 6,514 per vessel per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5,971 per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in daily vessel operating expense was primarily due to the timing of the purchase of stores and spares, higher repair and maintenance costs and higher crew costs. We believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation. CHARTER HIRE EXPENSES- Charter hire expenses increased by 0.5 million from 6.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in hire rates, partially offset by a decrease in chartered-in days. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES- For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 20.8 million and 21.3 million, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to lower legal and professional fees. TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT FEES- Technical management fees were 3.3 million and 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the variance due to timing of expenses during the year. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION- Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 1.1 million from 49.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 50.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in drydocking amortization expense for certain vessels that completed their respective drydockings during 2023. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense due to the operation of smaller fleet. IMPAIRMENT OF VESSEL ASSETS- During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 6.6 million of impairment of vessel assets. This includes 5.6 million impairment for the Genco Hadrian, a Capesize vessel, which was impaired during the second

 quarter of 2024. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 1.0 million of losses related to the disposal of replaced equipment on certain vessels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 28.1 million of impairment of vessel assets. This represented impairment for three of our Capesize vessels. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of these vessels. NET GAIN ON SALE OF VESSELS- During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net gain on sale of vessels of 16.7 million related primarily to the gains on the sale of the Genco Warrior during the third quarter of 2024 and the Genco Claudius and the Genco Maximus during the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by losses on the sale of the Genco Commodus during the first quarter of 2024. There were no vessels sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE- Other operating expense of 5.7 million recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists of costs incremental to routine expenses that were incurred related to our 2024 annual meeting held on May 23, 2024. OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME- INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased by 4.3 million from 6.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 10.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily a result of lower settlement payments received under our interest rate cap agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period during 2023 as a result of the expiration of these agreements. This increase was partially offset by a decrease due to lower outstanding debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period during 2023. INTEREST INCOME Interest income increased by 0.4 million from 1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. OTHER EXPENSE Other expense was 0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 0.3 million which is associated with the net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest of GSSM. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations, cash on hand, equity offerings and credit facility borrowings. We currently use our funds primarily for the acquisition of vessels, fleet renewal, drydocking for our vessels, payment of dividends, debt repayments and satisfying working capital requirements as may be needed to support our business. Our ability to continue to meet our liquidity needs is subject to and will be affected by cash utilized in operations, the economic or business environment in which we operate, shipping industry conditions, the financial

 condition of our customers, vendors and service providers, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants of our indebtedness, and other factors. We believe, given our current cash holdings, if drybulk shipping rates do not decline significantly from current levels, our capital resources, including cash anticipated to be generated within the year, are sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Such resources include unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 46.7 million as of September 30, 2024 in addition to the 333.0 million availability under the 500 Million Revolver as of September 30, 2024, which compares to a minimum liquidity requirement under our credit facility of approximately 21 million as of September 30, 2024, as well as the net proceeds from the sale of the Genco Hadrian of approximately 24 million, which was received in October 2024. Given anticipated capital expenditures related to vessel acquisitions, drydockings and fuel efficiency upgrade costs of 56.3 million and 47.7 million during the remainder of 2024 and 2025, respectively, as well as any quarterly dividend payments, we anticipate to continue to have significant cash expenditures. Refer to Capital Expenditures below for further details. However, if market conditions were to worsen significantly due to the war in Ukraine, the Houthi conflict in the Red Sea, the Israel-Hamas war, or other causes, then our cash resources may decline to a level that may put at risk our ability to pay dividends per our capital allocation strategy or at all. Throughout 2022, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made a total of 231.0 million of voluntary debt prepayments, resulting in a reduced cash flow breakeven rate from previous levels. During the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offsetting this debt reduction, we opportunistically drew down 65 million under the revolver of the 450 Million Credit Facility to partially fund the purchase of two Capesize vessels that were delivered during the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2024, we drew down 20 million under the 500 Million Revolver to partially fund the purchase of one Capesize vessel that was delivered during the fourth quarter of 2024. Going forward, given the nature of our revolving credit facility, we plan to actively manage our debt balance to reduce interest expense and may also opportunistically draw down debt to assist in funding accretive growth opportunities. As of September 30, 2024, there are no mandatory debt repayments until we must repay 80.0 million in 2028. Although we do not have any mandatory debt repayments until 2028, we intend to continue to pay down debt on a voluntary basis with a medium-term goal of zero net debt. As of September 30, 2024, the 500 Million Revolver contained collateral maintenance covenants that require the aggregate appraised value of collateral vessels to be at least 140 of the principal amount of the loan outstanding under such facility. If the values of our vessels were to decline as a result of the various geopolitical factors previously mentioned or otherwise, we may not satisfy this collateral maintenance requirement. If we do not satisfy the collateral maintenance requirement, we will need to post additional collateral or prepay outstanding loans to bring us back into compliance, or we will need to seek waivers, which may not be available or may be subject to conditions. In the future, we may require capital to fund acquisitions or to improve or support our ongoing operations and debt structure, particularly in light of economic conditions resulting from the war in Ukraine, the Houthi conflict in the Red Sea, the Israel-Hamas war, and the trajectory of China s economic recovery and stimulus measures. We may from time to time seek to raise additional capital through equity or debt offerings, selling vessels or other assets, pursuing strategic opportunities, or otherwise. We may also from time to time seek to incur additional debt financing from private or public sector sources, refinance our indebtedness or obtain waivers or modifications to our credit agreements to obtain more favorable terms, enhance flexibility in conducting our business, or otherwise. We may also seek to manage our interest rate exposure through hedging transactions. We may seek to accomplish any of these independently or in conjunction with one or more of these actions. However, if market conditions are unfavorable, we may be unable to accomplish any of the foregoing on acceptable terms or at all.

 On November 29, 2023, we entered into a fourth amendment to amend, extend and upsize our existing 450 Million Credit Facility and implement the 500 Million Revolver. The amended structure consists of a 500 million revolving credit facility, which can be utilized to support growth of our asset base as well as general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 7 Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the terms of the 500 Million Revolver, which information is incorporated herein by reference. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the 500 Million Revolver. Dividends Under our quarterly dividend policy, the amount available for quarterly dividends is to be calculated based on the following formula: Operating cash flow Less: Voluntary quarterly reserve Cash flow distributable as dividends The amount of dividends payable under the foregoing formula for each quarter of the year will be determined on a quarterly basis. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, operating cash flow is defined as voyage revenue less voyage expenses, charter hire expenses, realized gains or losses on fuel hedges, vessel operating expenses, general and administrative expenses other than non-cash restricted stock expenses, technical management fees, and interest expense other than non-cash deferred financing costs. Anticipated uses for the voluntary quarterly reserve include, but are not limited to, vessel acquisitions, debt prepayments and repayments, and general corporate purposes. In order to set aside funds for these purposes, the voluntary reserve will be set on a quarterly basis in the discretion of our Board and is anticipated to be based on future quarterly debt repayments and interest expense. On November 6, 2024, we announced a quarterly dividend of 0.40 per share. Our quarterly dividend policy and declaration and payment of dividends are subject to legally available funds, compliance with applicable law and contractual obligations (including our credit facilities) and our Board s determination that each declaration and payment is at that time in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders after its review of our financial performance. In connection with our comprehensive value strategy, we have paid down additional indebtedness under our credit facilities. The declaration and payment of any dividend or any stock repurchase is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors and management continue to closely monitor market developments together with the evaluation of our quarterly dividend policy in the current market environment. The principal business factors that our Board of Directors expects to consider when determining the timing and amount of dividend payments or stock repurchases include our earnings, financial condition, and cash requirements at the time. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the declaration and payment of dividends or stock repurchases other than from surplus. Marshall Islands law also prohibits the declaration and payment of dividends or stock repurchases while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend or such a stock repurchase. Heightened economic uncertainty and the potential for renewed drybulk market weakness as a result of the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, the Houthi conflict in the Red Sea, and related economic conditions may result in our suspension, reduction, or termination of future quarterly dividends.

 U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Dividends U.S. Holders For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual U.S. citizen or resident, (ii) a corporation that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, or any other U.S. entity taxable as a corporation, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust if either (x) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (y) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. If a partnership, or an entity treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership, such as a limited liability company, holds common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in such a partnership holding our common stock, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor. A beneficial owner of our common stock (other than a partnership) that is not a U.S. Holder is referred to below as a "Non-U.S. Holder." Subject to the discussion of passive foreign investment company (PFIC) status on pages 36 37 in the 2023 10-K, any distributions made by us to a U.S. Holder with respect to our common shares generally will constitute dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of those earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder's tax basis in our common shares (determined on a share-by-share basis), and thereafter as capital gain. U.S. Holders that are corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and own at least 10 of our shares may be able to claim a dividends-received-deduction and should consult their tax advisors. Dividends paid on our common shares to a U.S. Holder who is an individual, trust or estate, or a "non-corporate U.S. Holder," will generally be treated as "qualified dividend income" that is taxable to such non-corporate U.S. Holder at preferential tax rates, provided that (1) our common shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the NYSE, on which our common shares are traded); (2) we are not a PFIC for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year (which we do not believe we have been, are, or will be); (3) the non-corporate U.S. Holder's holding period of our common shares includes more than 60 days in the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on which our common shares becomes ex-dividend; and (4) the non-corporate U.S. Holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. A non-corporate U.S. Holder will be able to take qualified dividend income into account in determining its deductible investment interest (which is generally limited to its net investment income) only if it elects to do so; in such case, the dividend will be taxed at ordinary income rates. Non-corporate U.S. Holders also may be required to pay a 3.8 surtax on all or part of such holder's "net investment income," which includes, among other items, dividends on our shares, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. Investors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this surtax on their ownership of our shares. Amounts taxable as dividends generally will be treated as passive income from sources outside the U.S. However, if (a) we are 50 or more owned, by vote or value, by U.S. Holders and (b) at least 10 of our earnings and profits are attributable to sources within the U.S., then for foreign tax credit purposes, a portion of our dividends would be treated as derived from sources within the U.S. With respect to any dividend paid for any taxable year, the U.S. source ratio of our dividends for foreign tax credit purposes would be equal to the portion of our earnings and profits from sources within the U.S. for such taxable year divided by the total amount of our earnings and profits for such taxable year. The rules related to U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine whether and to what extent a credit would be available. Special rules may apply to any "extraordinary dividend" generally, a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10 of a shareholder's adjusted basis (or fair market value in certain circumstances) in a share of our common shares paid by us. If we pay an "extraordinary dividend" on our common shares that is treated as "qualified dividend income", then any loss derived by a non-corporate U.S. Holder from the sale or exchange of such common shares will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend.

 Tax Consequences if We Are a Passive Foreign Investment Company As discussed in U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders in Item 1.A Risk Factors in our 2023 10-K, a foreign corporation generally will be treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if, after applying certain look through rules, either (1) at least 75 of its gross income for any taxable year consists of passive income or (2) at least 50 of the average value or adjusted bases of its assets (determined on a quarterly basis) produce or are held for the production of passive income, i.e., passive assets. As discussed above, we do not believe that our past or existing operations would cause, or would have caused, us to be deemed a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. No assurance can be given that the IRS or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will not become a PFIC in any future taxable year because the PFIC test is an annual test, there are uncertainties in the application of the PFIC rules, and although we intend to manage our business so as to avoid PFIC status to the extent consistent with our other business goals, there could be changes in the nature and extent of our operations in future taxable years. If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which a U.S. Holder owns shares of our common stock (and regardless of whether we remain a PFIC for subsequent taxable years), the tax consequences to such a U.S. holder upon the receipt of distributions in respect of such shares that are treated as excess distributions would differ from those described above. In general, an excess distribution is the amount of distributions received during a taxable year that exceed 125 of the average amount of distributions received by a U.S. Holder in respect of the common shares during the preceding three taxable years, or if shorter, during the U.S. Holder s holding period prior to the taxable year of the distribution. The distributions that are excess distributions would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder s holding period for the common shares. The amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest marginal rate in effect for the U.S. Holder for that taxable year, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed on the resulting tax allocated to such other taxable years. The tax liability with respect to the amount allocated to taxable years prior to the year of the distribution cannot be offset by net operating losses. As an alternative to such tax treatment, a U.S. Holder may make a qualified electing fund election or mark to market election, to the extent available, in which event different rules would apply. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder if we were to be classified as a PFIC are complex. A U.S. Holder should consult with his or her own advisor with regard to those consequences, as well as with regard to whether he or she is eligible to and should make either of the elections described above. Non-U.S. Holders Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from us on our common shares unless the income is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States effectively connected income (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so provides, the dividends are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.). Effectively connected income (or, if an income tax treaty applies, income attributable to a permanent establishment maintained in the U.S.) generally will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax in the same manner discussed above relating to taxation of U.S. Holders. In addition, earnings and profits of a corporate Non-U.S. Holder that are attributable to such income, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30 , or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. Non-U.S. Holders may be subject to tax in jurisdictions other than the United States on dividends received from us on our common shares.

 Dividends paid on our common shares to a non-corporate U.S. Holder may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding tax if the non-corporate U.S. Holder: fails to provide us with an accurate taxpayer identification number; is notified by the IRS that they have become subject to backup withholding because they previously failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on their federal income tax returns; or fails to comply with applicable certification requirements A holder that is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding with respect to such dividends unless the holder certifies that it is a non-U.S. person, under penalties of perjury, or otherwise establishes an exemption therefrom. Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. Holders generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed their income tax liability by timely filing a refund claim with the IRS. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor concerning the overall tax consequences arising in your own particular situation under U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign law from the payment of dividends on our common stock. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 96.9 million and 52.2 million, respectively. This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher freight rates earned by our major bulk vessels and our Ultramax vessels, as well as changes in working capital. This increase was partially offset by an increase in drydocking costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 73.7 million and 3.3) million, respectively. This fluctuation was primarily a result of 79.1 million of proceeds from the sale of the Genco Commodus, the Genco Claudius, the Genco Maximus and the Genco Warrior during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 170.4 million and 60.8 million, respectively. The increase is primarily due to a 93.8 million increase in debt repayments made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was also a 15.9 million increase in the payment of dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Credit Facilities On November 29, 2023, we entered into a fourth amendment to amend, extend and upsize our existing 450 Million Credit Facility, implementing the 500 Million Revolver. The amended structure consists of a 500 million revolving credit facility, which can be utilized to support growth of our asset base as well as general corporate purposes. Interest Rate Swap and Cap Agreements, Forward Freight Agreements and Currency Swap Agreements During the first quarter of 2024, our last remaining interest rate cap agreement that we used to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates expired. Such agreements cap the borrowing rate on our variable debt to provide a hedge against the risk of rising rates. At September 30, 2024, the total notional principal amount of the interest rate cap agreements is 0. Refer to Note 8 Derivative instruments of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Table of Contents 
 As part of our business strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. In determining the fair value of interest rate derivatives, we consider the creditworthiness of both the counterparty and ourselves, which has not changed significantly and has no effect on the valuation. Valuations prior to any adjustments for credit risk would be validated by comparison with counterparty valuations. Amounts would not and should not be identical due to the different modeling assumptions. Any material differences would be investigated. As part of our business strategy, we may enter into arrangements commonly known as forward freight agreements, or FFAs, to hedge and manage our exposure to the charter market risks relating to the deployment of our vessels. Generally, these arrangements would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified tonnage freighting commitment forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route. Upon settlement, if the contracted charter rate is less than the average of the rates (as reported by an identified index) for the specified route and period, the seller of the FFA is required to pay the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the contracted rate and the settlement rate multiplied by the number of days in the specific period. Conversely, if the contracted rate is greater than the settlement rate, the buyer is required to pay the seller the settlement sum. Although FFAs can be entered into for a variety of purposes, including for hedging, as an option, for trading, or for arbitrage, if we decided to enter into FFAs, our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management. It is not currently our intention to enter into FFAs to generate a stream of income independent of the revenues we derive from the operation of our fleet of vessels. If we determine to enter into FFAs, we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns, but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market. We have not entered into any FFAs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Capital Expenditures We make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with our vessel acquisitions. Our fleet currently consists of 42 drybulk vessels, including 16 Capesize, 15 Ultramax and eleven Supramax vessels. As previously announced, we have implemented a fuel efficiency upgrade program for certain of our vessels in an effort to generate fuel savings and increase the future earnings potential for these vessels. The upgrades have been successfully installed during previous drydockings. Under our comprehensive IMO 2023 compliance plan, we have installed and intend to install energy saving devices and apply high performance paint systems in order to reduce fuel consumption and emissions among other key initiatives, on select vessels. We have and plan to undertake most, if not all, of these initiatives while our vessels undergo their regularly scheduled drydocking. The future estimated expenditures are included in the table below. In addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, we will incur additional expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings for our fleet. We estimate our drydocking costs, including capitalized costs incurred during drydocking related to vessel assets and vessel equipment, ballast water treatment systems BWTS costs, fuel efficiency upgrades and scheduled off-hire days for our fleet through 2025 to be: 

Year Estimated Drydocking Costs Estimated BWTS Costs Estimated Fuel Efficiency Upgrade Costs Estimated Off-hire Days (U.S. dollars in millions) October 1 - December 31, 2024 7.0 1.8 111 2025 40.8 1.1 5.8 580

Table of Contents 
 The costs reflected are estimates based on drydocking our vessels in China. Actual costs will vary based on various factors, including where the drydockings are actually performed. We expect to fund these costs with cash on hand. These costs do not include drydock expense items that are reflected in vessel operating expenses. Actual length of drydocking will vary based on the condition of the vessel, yard schedules and other factors. Higher repairs and maintenance expense during drydocking for vessels which are over 15 years old typically result in a higher number of off-hire days depending on the condition of the vessel. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred a total of 15.8 million and 10.7 million of drydocking costs, respectively, excluding costs incurred during drydocking that were capitalized to vessel assets or vessel equipment. We completed the drydocking of seven of our vessels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the drydocking for one of our vessels began during the third quarter of 2024 and completed during the fourth quarter of 2024. We estimate that an additional three of our vessels will be drydocked during the remainder of 2024 and 18 of our vessels will be drydocked during 2025. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Inflation Inflation has only a moderate effect on our expenses given current economic conditions. In the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear, these pressures would increase our operating, voyage, general and administrative, and financing costs. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Except as described below, there have been no changes or updates to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in the 2023 10-K. Vessels and Depreciation We record the value of our vessels at their cost (which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage) less accumulated depreciation. We depreciate our drybulk vessels on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, estimated to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard. Depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value of 400/lightweight ton (lwt) based on the 15-year average scrap value of steel. An increase in the residual value of the vessels will decrease the annual depreciation charge over the remaining useful life of the vessels. Similarly, an increase in the useful life of a drybulk vessel would also decrease the annual depreciation charge. Comparatively, a decrease in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge. However, when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, we will adjust the vessel s useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel s further commercial use. The carrying value of each of our vessels does not represent the fair market value of such vessel or the amount we could obtain if we were to sell any of our vessels, which could be more or less. Under U.S. GAAP, we would not record a loss if the fair market value of a vessel (excluding its charter) is below our carrying value unless and until we determine to sell that vessel or the vessel is impaired as discussed in the 2023 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an impairment loss for the Genco Hadrian, one of our Capesize vessels, and the vessel has been classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. The sale of the Genco Hadrian was completed on October 4, 2024. There were no impairment losses recorded during the three months

Table of Contents 
 ended September 30, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an impairment loss for three of our Capesize vessels (the Genco Commodus, the Genco Claudius and the Genco Maximus). The Genco Commodus, the Genco Claudius and the Genco Maximus were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2023 and the sale of these vessels were completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Under our credit facility, we regularly submit to the lenders valuations of our vessels on an individual charter free basis in order to evidence our compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants under our credit facility. Such a valuation is not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale, which may be more or less, and should not be relied upon as such. We were in compliance with the collateral maintenance covenant under our 500 Million Revolver as of September 30, 2024. We obtained valuations for all of the vessels in our fleet pursuant to the terms of the 500 Million Revolver. We compare the carrying value of our vessels with the vessel valuations obtained for covenant compliance purposes to determine whether an indicator of impairment is present (excluding any vessels held for sale as noted above). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, four and eight of our Capesize vessels, respectively, had carrying values that exceeded their vessel valuations, which is an indicator of impairment. However, based on an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from each of these vessels as described in the 2023 10-K, there were no impairment losses recorded for these vessels incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three months ended December 31, 2023 (excluding the one and three vessels held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively as noted above). The amount by which the carrying value at September 30, 2024 of four of our Capesize vessels exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes ranged, on an individual vessel basis, from 1.0 million to 2.0 million per vessel, and 5.8 million on an aggregate basis for these four vessels. Comparatively, the amount by which the carrying value at December 31, 2023 of eight of our Capesize vessels exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes ranged, on an individual vessel basis, from 4.1 million to 8.3 million per vessel, and 47.9 million on an aggregate basis for these eight vessels. The average amount by which the carrying value of these vessels exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes was 1.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 6.0 million as of December 31, 2023. However, neither such valuation nor the carrying value in the table below reflects the value of long-term time charters, if any, related to some of our vessels.

Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 Vessel Acquisitions and Dispositions in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the sale of vessel assets. ITEM 3 . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest rate risk We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. Our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flow in relation to our borrowings. During the first quarter of 2024, our last remaining interest rate cap agreement that we used to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates expired. Refer to Note 8 Derivative Instruments of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 
 Interest rate cap agreements cap the borrowing rate on our variable debt to provide a hedge against the risk of rising rates. We are subject to market risks relating to changes in SOFR rates because we have significant amounts of floating rate debt outstanding. On May 30, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the 450 Million Credit Facility to transition from the use of LIBOR to calculate interest to SOFR effective June 30, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we were subject to the following interest rates on the outstanding debt under our credit facilities (refer to Note 7 Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for effective dates and termination dates for our credit facilities outlined below) : 450 Million Credit Facility One-month or three-month LIBOR plus 2.15 until June 30, 2023. Effective June 30, 2023, we transitioned from the use of LIBOR to SOFR Rates. Additionally, on August 3, 2023, the applicable margin was reduced from 2.15 to 2.10 pursuant to the sustainability link term of the facility. These rates were applicable until November 29, 2023, when we entered into the 500 Million Revolver. 500 Million Revolver One-month SOFR plus 1.85 until August 1, 2024 when the applicable margin was increased from 1.85 to 1.90 pursuant to the sustainability link term of the facility. A 1 increase in SOFR would result in an increase of 1.1 million in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. From time to time, the Company may consider derivative financial instruments such as swaps and caps or other means to protect itself against interest rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments As part of our business strategy, we may enter into interest rate swaps or interest rate cap agreements to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. During the first quarter of 2024, our last remaining interest rate cap agreement that we used to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates expired. Refer to Note 8 Derivative Instruments of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our prior interest rate cap agreements were initially designated and qualified as cash flow hedges. The premium paid was recognized in income on a rational basis, and all changes in the value of the caps were deferred in AOCI and were subsequently reclassified into Interest expense in the period when the hedged interest affects earnings. Refer to Interest rate risk section above for further information regarding interest rate swap agreements. We have entered into bunker swap and forward fuel purchase agreements with the objective of reducing the risk of the effect of changing fuel prices. Our bunker swap and forward fuel purchase agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, any unrealized or realized gains or losses are recognized as other (expense) income. Refer to the Bunker swap and forward fuel purchase agreements section of Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information. Currency and exchange rates risk The majority of transactions in the international shipping industry are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Virtually all of our revenues and most of our operating costs are in U.S. Dollars. We incur certain operating expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and the foreign exchange risk associated with these operating expenses is immaterial.
