 The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its reporting unit goodwill either qualitatively or quantitatively annually during the third quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. 
 The Company completed qualitative evaluations on its reporting units, with the exception of the engineered materials reporting unit, and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company experienced decreased demand, identified near-term negative trends in the automotive and industrial end-markets and experienced other challenging current macroeconomic conditions. Therefore, the engineered materials reporting unit was tested quantitatively using an equal weighting of the income approach based on the discounted estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit and market approach using the guideline public company method. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include the discount rate, growth rate, tax rate, cash flow projections and terminal value rate. The discount rate was based on market participant data, including the Company's weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks specific to the reporting unit. The growth rates and cash flow projections were based on historical trends and expected growth drivers such as macroeconomic trends in the industries and territories in which the reporting unit operates. The tax rate considers the operating structure of the reporting unit and tax rates in jurisdictions in which the reporting unit operates. A terminal value rate was applied to the final year of the projected period to reflect continued stable, perpetual growth. Under the market approach, the Company utilized earnings multiples for public companies similar to the engineered materials reporting unit adjusted for a control premium. 
 Based on the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the engineered materials reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its underlying assets. Therefore, the Company did record an impairment loss to goodwill during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Although no impairment of the engineered materials reporting unit was identified, the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than . While the Company believes the assumptions used in the impairment test were reasonable, changes in market conditions or key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing for any of the Company's reporting units and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge. Such charge could be material to the statements of operations and balance sheets in the period(s) recorded.

 The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its indefinite-lived intangible assets either qualitatively or quantitatively annually during the third quarter of its fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. 
 The Company completed qualitative evaluations on its indefinite-lived intangible assets, with the exception of those assigned to the engineered materials reporting unit, and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying value. 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets assigned to the engineered materials reporting unit were tested quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. The key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. The discount rate was based on the Company's weighted average return on assets adjusted for risks specific to the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Royalty rates are established by management using the most recent third party valuations and are periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants. The growth rates and sales projections were based on historical trends and expected growth drivers such as macroeconomic trends in the industries and territories in which the indefinite-lived intangible assets operate. The tax rate considers the operating structure of the Company and tax rates in jurisdictions in which the indefinite-lived intangible assets operate. A terminal value rate was applied to the final year of the projected period to reflect continued stable, perpetual growth. 
 In connection with the Company's annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment loss of million in Other charges (gains), net Note 1 8 to impair the net book value of certain trade names, primarily Zytel , included in the Engineered Materials segment. Other than these trade names, the estimated fair value of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded the carrying value of the underlying assets. 
 While the Company believes the assumptions used in the impairment tests were reasonable, changes in market conditions or key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the

The China Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese U.S. 
 Also in January 2023, CSIT entered into a senior unsecured working capital loan contract for CNY million (the "China Working Capital Term Loan Agreement"), payable months from withdrawal date and bearing interest at less than certain interbank rates. The loan under the China Working Capital Term Loan Agreement was fully drawn in January 2023 and was fully repaid during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 Accounts Receivable Purchasing Facility 
 In June 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the amended and restated receivables purchase agreement (the "Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement") under its U.S. accounts receivable purchasing facility among certain of the Company's subsidiaries, its wholly-owned, "bankruptcy remote" special purpose subsidiary ("SPE") and certain global financial institutions ("Purchasers"). The Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement extends the term of the accounts receivable purchasing facility such that the SPE may sell certain receivables until June 18, 2025. Under the Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement, transfers of U.S. accounts receivable from the SPE are treated as sales and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the U.S. accounts receivable to the SPE. The Company and related subsidiaries have no continuing involvement in the transferred U.S. accounts receivable, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the U.S. accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors of the Company or the related subsidiaries. These sales are transacted at of the face value of the relevant U.S. accounts receivable, resulting in derecognition of the U.S. accounts receivables from the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheet. The Company de-recognized billion and billion of accounts receivable under this agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and collected billion and billion of accounts receivable sold under this agreement during the same periods. Unsold U.S. accounts receivable of million were pledged by the SPE as collateral to the Purchasers as of September 30, 2024. 
 Factoring and Discounting Agreements 
 The Company has factoring agreements in Europe and Singapore with financial institutions to sell and of certain accounts receivable, respectively, on a non-recourse basis. The Company also has a factoring agreement in China with a financial institution to sell of certain accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis. These transactions are treated as sales and are accounted for as reductions in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer. The Company has no material continuing involvement in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Company de-recognized million and million of accounts receivable under these factoring agreements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and collected million and million of accounts receivable sold under these factoring agreements during the same periods. 
 The Company has master discounting agreements (the "Master Discounting Agreements") with financial institutions in China to discount, on a non-recourse basis, banker's acceptance drafts ("BADs"), classified as accounts receivable. Under the Master Discounting Agreements, transfers of BADs are treated as sales and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the Master Discounting Agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the transferred BADs to the financial institutions. The Company has no continuing involvement in the transferred BADs, and the BADs are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. The Company received million and million from the accounts receivable transferred under the Master Discounting Agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Covenants 
 The Company's material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, such as events of default and change of control provisions, and in the case of the U.S. Credit Agreements the maintenance of certain financial ratios (subject to adjustment following certain qualifying acquisitions and dispositions, as set forth in the U.S. Credit Agreements, as amended). Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. 
 The Company is in compliance with the covenants in its material financing arrangements as of September 30, 2024.

 Divestiture obligations Note 14 
 Active sites U.S. Superfund sites Other environmental remediation liabilities Total 
 Remediation 
 Due to its industrial history and through retained contractual and legal obligations, the Company has the obligation to remediate specific areas on its own sites as well as on divested, demerger, orphan or U.S. Superfund sites (defined below). In addition, as part of the demerger agreement between the Company and Hoechst AG ("Hoechst"), a specified portion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of Hoechst divestitures was transferred to the Company Note 14 ). Certain of these sites, at which the Company maintains continuing involvement, were and continue to be designated as discontinued operations when closed. The Company provides for such obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company believes that environmental remediation costs will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given period. 
 U.S. Superfund Sites 
 In the U.S., the Company may be subject to substantial claims brought by U.S. federal or state regulatory agencies or private individuals pursuant to statutory authority or common law. In particular, the Company has a potential liability under the U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and related state laws (collectively referred to as "Superfund") for investigation and cleanup costs at certain sites. At most of these sites, numerous companies, including the Company, or one of its predecessor companies, have been notified that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), state governing bodies or private individuals consider such companies to be potentially responsible parties ("PRP") under Superfund or related laws. The proceedings relating to these sites are in various stages. The cleanup process has not been completed at most sites, and the status of the insurance coverage for some of these proceedings is uncertain. Consequently, the Company cannot accurately determine its ultimate liability for investigation or cleanup costs at these sites. 
 As events progress at each site for which it has been named a PRP, the Company accrues any probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. In establishing these liabilities, the Company considers the contaminants of concern, the potential impact thereof, the relationship of the contaminants of concern to its current and historic operations, its shipment of waste to a site, its percentage of total waste shipped to the site, the types of wastes involved, the conclusions of any studies, the magnitude of any remedial actions that may be necessary and the number and viability of other PRPs. Often the Company joins with other PRPs to sign joint defense agreements that settle, among PRPs, each party's percentage allocation of costs at the site. Although the ultimate liability may differ from the estimate, the Company routinely reviews the liabilities and revises the estimate, as appropriate, based on the most current information available. 
 One such site is the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, which is comprised of a number of sub-sites, including the Lower Passaic River Study Area ("LPRSA"), which is the lower 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River ("Lower Passaic River Site"), and the Newark Bay Study Area. The Company and other companies are parties to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS") at the Lower Passaic River Site in order to identify the levels of contaminants and potential cleanup actions, including the potential migration of contaminants between the LPRSA and the Newark Bay Study Area.

 billion. In September 2021, the EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting an interim remedial plan for the upper 9 miles of the Lower Passaic River ("Upper 9 Miles"). Pursuant to the EPA's Record of Decision, targeted dredging will be conducted in the Upper 9 Miles to address surface sediments with elevated contamination followed by the installation of an engineered cap at an EPA estimated cost of million. 
 The Company owned and/or operated facilities in the vicinity of the Lower 8.3 Miles, but has found no evidence that it contributed any of the contaminants of concern to the Passaic River. In June 2018, Occidental Chemical Corporation ("OCC"), the successor to the Diamond Alkali Company, sued a subsidiary of the Company and 119 other parties alleging claims for joint and several damages, contribution and declaratory relief under Section 107 and 113 of Superfund for costs to clean up the LPRSA portion of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, Occidental Chemical Corporation v. 21st Century Fox America, Inc., et al, No. 2:18-CV-11273 (MCA) (LDW) (U.S. District Court New Jersey) (the "2018 OCC Lawsuit"), alleging that each of the defendants owned or operated a facility that contributed contamination to the LPRSA. With respect to the Company, the 2018 OCC lawsuit is limited to the former Celanese facility that Essex County, New Jersey has agreed to indemnify the Company for and does not change the Company's estimated liability for LPRSA cleanup costs. 
 Separately, the United States lodged a Consent Decree in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey in December 2022 that will resolve the Company's liability (and that of more than 80 other settling defendants) to the EPA for costs to clean up both the Lower 8.3 Miles and Upper 9 Miles of the Lower Passaic River Site in exchange for a collective payment of million, United States v. Alden Leeds, Inc., No. 2:22-7326 (MCA) (LDW) (U.S. District Court New Jersey) ("Consent Decree Action"). The Consent Decree also will provide the Company protection from contribution claims by others for costs incurred to clean up both the Lower 8.3 Miles and Upper 9 Miles of the Lower Passaic River Site. The Company's proposed payment toward the million collective settlement payment is not material to the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Consent Decree is still subject to public comment and court approval. 
 In March 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered an order staying and administratively terminating the 2018 OCC Lawsuit, pending resolution of the request for judicial approval of the Consent Decree in the Consent Decree Action. Also in March 2023, OCC filed a new lawsuit against parties, including a subsidiary of the Company, seeking to recover costs for remedial design work the EPA has ordered OCC to undertake for a portion of the LPRSA at an estimated cost of million, Occidental Chemical Corporation v. Givaudan Fragrances Corporation, No. 2:23-cv-1699 (U.S. District Court New Jersey) (the "2023 OCC Lawsuit"). Like the earlier lawsuit, the 2023 OCC Lawsuit concerns the facility Essex County, New Jersey purchased and for which Essex County, New Jersey has agreed to defend and indemnify the Company. This new lawsuit does not change the Company's estimated liability for LPRSA cleanup costs. 
 The Company will continue to vigorously defend these matters and continues to believe that its ultimate allocable share of the cleanup costs with respect to the Lower Passaic River Site, previously estimated at less than , will not be material. 
 Other Environmental Matters 
 In April 2022, a methanol leak on a pipeline to the Company's Bishop, Texas facility was discovered. The release has been contained, the leak has been repaired and the pipeline has resumed operation. The Company promptly disclosed the incident to state and federal authorities, including the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the EPA, and remediation activities are now completed. While the Company has not received a notice of violation nor been assessed any fines or penalties to date, the Company recorded a reserve in Other current liabilities based on anticipated clean-up costs and possible penalties to state or federal authorities. The Company does not believe that resolution of this matter will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

 per share ("Common Stock"), unless the Company's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise. The amount available to the Company to pay cash dividends is not currently restricted by the Global Credit Agreements and its indentures governing its senior unsecured notes. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors, which may determine to cease to follow or to modify the Company's past practice, and will depend on, among other things, the results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Company's Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
 The Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share on its Common Stock on October 17, 2024, amounting to million. The cash dividend will be paid on November 13, 2024 to holders of record as of October 30, 2024. 
 On November 4, 2024, the Company announced its intent to reduce its quarterly dividend by approximately percent beginning in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Treasury Stock 
 The Company's Board of Directors authorizes repurchases of Common Stock from time to time. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

 ) ) 
 The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was higher compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to prior period impacts that did not recur in the current year, including deferred tax benefits of million resulting from the relocation of certain intangible assets to align with the foreign operations acquired with the Mobility Materials business from DuPont de Nemours, Inc., differences in the tax and U.S. GAAP gain resulting from the formation of the Nutrinova joint venture and decreases in valuation allowance on U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards due to revised forecasts of foreign sourced income and expenses during the carryforward period. In addition, the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was higher compared to the same period in 2023 due to non-recurring tax effects related to internal debt restructuring transactions in the current year. 
 In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted and was effective January 1, 2018. The U.S. Treasury has issued various notices and final and proposed regulatory packages supplementing the TCJA provisions since 2018. There have been no material proposed or final regulatory packages during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the "IRA") was enacted and included a 1 excise tax on share repurchases in excess of 1 million, and a corporate minimum tax of 15 on adjusted book earnings. The corporate minimum tax paid is creditable in future years to the extent regular tax liability exceeds the minimum tax in any given year. The Company does not expect these provisions or any newly issued administrative guidance to have a material impact to future income tax expense. The IRA also provided various beneficial credits for energy efficiency related to manufacturing, transportation and fuels, hydrogen/carbon recapture and renewable energy, which the Company is evaluating in regard to planned projects. 
 The Company will continue to monitor the expected impacts of any new guidance on the Company's filing positions and will record the impacts as discrete income tax expense adjustments in the period the guidance is finalized or becomes effective.

 Insurance contracts in nonqualified trusts Long-term debt, including current installments of long-term debt 
 
 In general, the equity investments included in the table above are not publicly traded and their fair values are not readily determinable. The Company believes the carrying values approximate fair value. Insurance contracts in nonqualified trusts consist of long-term fixed income securities, which are valued using independent vendor pricing models with observable inputs in the active market and therefore represent a Level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of long-term debt is based on valuations from third-party banks and market quotations and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The fair value of obligations under finance leases, which are included in long-term debt in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets, is based on lease payments and discount rates, which are not observable in the market and therefore represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, trade payables, short-term borrowings and the current installments of long-term debt approximate carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These items have been excluded from the table with the exception of the current installments of long-term debt.

 of the remediation cost without further limitations. Cumulative payments under the divestiture agreements as of September 30, 2024 are million. Though the Company is significantly under its obligation cap under Category B, most of the divestiture agreements have become time barred and/or any notified environmental damage claims have been partially settled. 
 The Company has also undertaken in the demerger agreement to indemnify Hoechst and its legal successors for (i) of any and all Category A liabilities that result from Hoechst being held as the responsible party pursuant to public law or current or future environmental law or by third parties pursuant to private or public law related to contamination and (ii) liabilities that Hoechst is required to discharge, including tax liabilities, which are associated with businesses that were included in the demerger but were not demerged due to legal restrictions on the transfers of such items. These indemnities do not provide for any monetary or time limitations. The Company has not been requested by Hoechst to make any payments in connection with this indemnification. Accordingly, the Company has not made any payments to Hoechst and its legal successors. 
 Based on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the lack of requests for indemnification, the Company cannot estimate the remaining demerger obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued. 
 Divestiture Obligations 
 The Company and its predecessor companies agreed to indemnify third-party purchasers of former businesses and assets for various pre-closing conditions, as well as for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. Such liabilities also include environmental liability, product liability, antitrust and other liabilities. These indemnifications and guarantees represent standard contractual terms associated with typical divestiture agreements and, other than environmental liabilities, the Company does not believe that they expose the Company to significant risk Note 9 ). 
 The Company has divested numerous businesses, investments and facilities through agreements containing indemnifications or guarantees to the purchasers. Many of the obligations contain monetary and/or time limitations, which extend through 2037. The aggregate amount of outstanding indemnifications and guarantees provided for under these agreements is million as of September 30, 2024. Other agreements do not provide for any monetary or time limitations. 
 Based on the Company's evaluation of currently available information, including the number of requests for indemnification or other payment received by the Company, the Company cannot estimate the remaining divestiture obligations, if any, in excess of amounts accrued. 
 Purchase Obligations 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various purchase commitments for goods and services. The Company maintains a number of "take-or-pay" contracts for purchases of raw materials, utilities and other services. Certain of the contracts contain a contract termination buy-out provision that allows for the Company to exit the contracts for amounts less than the remaining take-or-pay obligations. Additionally, the Company has other outstanding commitments representing maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts and software agreements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of billion, of which million will be paid in 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027, million in 2028 and the balance thereafter through 2042. 
 Contingencies 
 The Company is involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of business, relating to such matters as product liability, land disputes, insurance coverage disputes, contracts, employment, antitrust or competition, intellectual property, personal injury and other actions in tort, workers' compensation, chemical exposure, asbestos exposure, taxes, trade compliance, acquisitions and divestitures, claims of current and legacy shareholders, past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment. The Company is actively defending those matters where the Company is named as a defendant and, based on the current facts, does not believe the outcomes from these matters would be material to the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
 As previously reported, in July 2020, the Company settled a European Commission competition law investigation involving certain of its subsidiaries and three other companies related to certain past ethylene purchases. Shell Chemicals Europe and another group of corporate claimants have filed claims for damages with the District Court of Amsterdam against four companies, including Celanese, arising from those activities, and the first court hearing was held in late September 2023. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. While it is possible that additional parties could assert

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report"), the term "Celanese" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the "Company," "we," "our" and "us," refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The term "Celanese U.S." refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Celanese Corporation and Subsidiaries consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on February 23, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as part of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K ("2023 Form 10-K") and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements herein, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). 
 Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this section and other parts of this Quarterly Report involve both risk and uncertainty. Several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. Many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond the control of management. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below and at the beginning of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. Generally, words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "may," "can," "could," "might," and "will," and similar expressions, as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views and beliefs with respect to future events as of the date hereof, are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. All forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report are made as of the date hereof, and the risk that actual results will differ materially from expectations expressed in this Quarterly Report will increase with the passage of time. We undertake no obligation, and disclaim any duty, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in our expectations or otherwise. 
 Risk Factors 
 See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K for a description of certain risk factors that you should consider which could significantly affect our business and/or financial results.

 Consolidated Results 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales decreased 75 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 lower pricing, driven by our Acetyl Chain segment due to an environment with greater supply than demand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and demand-based pressures on certain pricing inputs, as well as our Engineered Materials segment due to product mix and competitive market dynamics; and 
 lower volume in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily driven by the formation of the Nutrinova joint venture (see Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information); 
 partially offset by: 
 higher volume in our Engineered Materials segment for polyoxymethylene ("POM") in Europe, as well as higher volume in our Acetyl Chain segment primarily for acetate tow and vinyl acetate monomer ("VAM") principally in Europe. 
 Operating profit decreased 594 million, or 71 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 a gain of 508 million in our Engineered Materials segment recognized in September 2023 on the formation of the Nutrinova joint venture, which did not recur in the current year (see Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information); 
 lower Net sales across our segments; and 
 an unfavorable impact of 45 million to Other (charges) gains, net, in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily related to an impairment loss on certain trade names, primarily Zytel , arising from our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment and restructuring costs for the previously announced closure of our facility in Mechelen, Belgium (see Note 18 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net and Note 5 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information); 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 partially offset by: 
 lower merger and acquisition project spending of 16 million in our Other Activities segment. 
 Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates increased 39 million, or 325 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 an increase in earnings from our Mylar Specialty Films (formally DuPont Teijin Films) strategic affiliates of 24 million, primarily due to increased restructuring costs incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2023, which did not recur in the current year. 
 Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 33 compared to a tax benefit of 33 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to prior period impacts that did not recur in the current year, including deferred tax benefits of 293 million resulting from the relocation of certain intangible assets to align with the foreign operations acquired with the M M Acquisition, differences in the tax and U.S. GAAP gain resulting from the formation of the Nutrinova joint venture and a decrease in valuation allowance on U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards due to revised forecasts of foreign sourced income and expenses during the carryforward period. See Note 11 - Income Taxes in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales decreased 461 million, or 6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 lower pricing, driven by our Acetyl Chain segment, due to an environment with greater supply than demand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily in Europe and Asia, as well as our Engineered Materials segment due to product mix, competitive market dynamics and decreased energy surcharges; 
 lower volume in our Engineered Material segment, primarily driven by the formation of the Nutrinova joint venture (see Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information); and 
 an unfavorable currency impact, primarily resulting from a weaker Japanese Yen ("JPY") and Chinese Yuan ("CNY") relative to the U.S. dollar; 
 partially offset by: 
 higher volume in our Acetyl Chain segment for most of our products, primarily VAM, acid and downstream derivative products, as well as higher volume within our Engineered Materials segment for POM in Europe and Asia. 
 Operating profit decreased 720 million, or 50 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 a gain of 508 million recognized in September 2023 on the formation of the Nutrinova joint venture, which did not recur in the current year (see Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information); 
 lower Net sales across our segments; 
 higher accelerated depreciation expense of 72 million in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily related to the previously announced closure of our polymerization units in Uentrop, Germany and our facility in Mechelen, Belgium (see Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information); and 
 an unfavorable impact of 70 million to Other (charges) gains, net, in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily related to restructuring costs for the previously announced closure of our facility in Mechelen, Belgium and an impairment loss on certain trade names, primarily Zytel , arising from our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment (see Note 18 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net and Note 5 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information);

Table of Contents 

 partially offset by: 
 lower raw materials costs in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments; and 
 lower merger and acquisition project spending of 34 million in our Other Activities segment. 
 Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates increased 107 million, or 214 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 an increase in earnings from our Mylar Specialty Films (formally DuPont Teijin Films) strategic affiliates of 57 million, primarily due to increased restructuring costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which did not recur in the current year; and 
 an increase in earnings from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate, primarily as a result of higher methyl tertiary-butyl ether ("MTBE") volume and margin, partially offset by lower methanol sales volume. 
 Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 24 compared to a tax benefit of 20 for the same period in 2023. The higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to: 
 prior period impacts that did not recur in the current year, including deferred tax benefits of 293 million resulting from the relocation of certain intangible assets to align with the foreign operations acquired in the M M Acquisition, differences in the tax and U.S. GAAP gain resulting from the formation of the Nutrinova joint venture and decreases in valuation allowance on U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards due to revised forecasts of foreign sourced income and expenses during the carryforward period; and 
 non-recurring tax effects related to internal debt restructuring transactions in the current year.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we have 1.6 billion available for borrowing under our senior U.S. unsecured revolving credit facility and 64 million available for borrowing under our separate China Revolving Credit Facilities (defined below), if required, to meet our working capital needs and other contractual obligations. In addition, we held cash and cash equivalents of 813 million as of September 30, 2024. Further, we entered into the November 2024 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined below), which provides for a delayed-draw term loan due 364 days from the date of borrowing in an amount up to 1.0 billion. We are actively managing our business to maintain and improve cash flow and reduce our debt, and we believe that liquidity from the above-referenced sources will be sufficient to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future. 
 On February 29, 2024, we announced the intended closure of our facility in Mechelen, Belgium to optimize production costs across our global network. This operation is included in the Engineered Materials segment. We expect to incur additional exit and shutdown costs related to the closure of the facility of approximately 30 million, inclusive of estimated employee termination costs, through 2028. See Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 
 In October 2023, we announced the intended closure of our Polyamide 66 ("PA66") and High-Performance Nylon ("HPN") polymerization units at our facility in Uentrop, Germany to optimize production costs across our global network. These operations are included in the Engineered Materials segment. See Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 
 In September 2023, we formed a food ingredients joint venture with Mitsui Co., Ltd. ("Mitsui") under the name Nutrinova. We contributed receivables, inventory, property, plant and equipment, certain other assets, liabilities, technology and employees of our food ingredients business while retaining a 30 interest in the joint venture. Mitsui acquired the remaining 70 interest in the food ingredients business for a purchase price of 503 million, subject to transaction adjustments. We are accounting for our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment, and our portion of the results continues to be included in the Engineered Materials segment. For further information regarding the food ingredients joint venture, see Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 
 Our incurrence of debt to finance the purchase price for a majority of the Mobility Materials business (the "M M Business") acquired from DuPont de Nemours, Inc. in November 2022 (the "M M Acquisition") has increased our leverage and our ratio of indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA as set forth in our senior unsecured credit facilities. We believe that cash flows from our operations, together with cash generation, synergy opportunities from the M M Acquisition and cost reduction initiatives, will support our deleveraging efforts over the next few years. However, we expect the weakened demand environment, as discussed below, to continue to adversely impact our cash generation in the near-term. In furtherance of our deleveraging efforts, we have paused our share repurchase program and are in the process of evaluating additional cash generation or conservation opportunities. As part of this process, on November 4, 2024, we announced our intent to reduce our quarterly dividend by approximately 95 percent beginning in the first quarter of 2025. We will continue to evaluate our dividend policy, 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 taking into account our ability to return to a balanced capital allocation strategy. Our deleveraging efforts may also include, in addition to the food ingredients joint venture described above, other opportunistic dispositions or monetization of other product or business lines or other assets. 
 While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements, including debt service, for the next 12 months. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional capital, reducing or pausing future dividend payments or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels. 
 We have focused our near-term capital expenditures on required maintenance projects, productivity improvements, and selected short-term growth projects, as we continue to prioritize deleveraging and expect total capital expenditures to be approximately 425 million in 2024. In Engineered Materials, at our Nanjing, China facility, our expansions of (1) the compounding plant is in construction and we are accelerating completion to meet demand and (2) the new liquid crystal polymer ("LCP") plant are on schedule and in construction. At our Bishop, Texas facility, our debottleneck of the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene ("UHMW-PE") unit is on schedule and in detailed engineering design while construction is delayed approximately 12 months in line with demand growth. Our energy optimization productivity and greenhouse gas reduction project at our polyoxymethylene ("POM") unit in Frankfurt, Germany is on schedule in detailed engineering design. In the Acetyl Chain, our planned expansion of our vinyl acetate ethylene ("VAE") emulsion plant in Frankfurt, Germany is in construction and on schedule for start-up in the second quarter of 2025. We continue to see the investments made in recent years strengthen the growth and reliability, while lowering the carbon footprint of our manufacturing network to best serve our customers. 
 On a stand-alone basis, Celanese and its immediate 100 owned subsidiary, Celanese U.S., have no independent external operations of their own. Accordingly, they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to Celanese and Celanese U.S. in order to meet their obligations, including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes, and to pay dividends on our Common Stock. 
 We are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate, such as China, South Korea, India and Indonesia. Capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies, repatriate earnings or capital, lend via intercompany loans or create cross-border cash pooling arrangements. Our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in China. Pursuant to applicable regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the Chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of China, puts certain limitations on duration, purpose and amount of intercompany loans, and restricts cross-border cash pooling. While it is possible that future tightening of these restrictions or application of new similar restrictions could impact us, these limitations do not currently restrict our operations. 
 We remain in compliance with the covenants in the Global Credit Agreements (defined below) and expect to remain in compliance based on our current expectation of future results of operations and planned cash generation activities. If the actual future results of our operations and cash generation activities differ materially from these expectations, we may be required to seek an amendment to or waiver of any impacted covenants, which may increase our borrowing costs under the Global Credit Agreements. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased 992 million to 813 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 695 million of the 813 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we incurred a prior year charge associated with the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. These funds are largely accessible without additional material tax consequences, if needed in the U.S., to fund operations.

 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 597 million to 472 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 1.1 billion for the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 unfavorable trade working capital of 505 million, primarily due to inventory increases compared to prior year reductions; the timing of collections of trade receivables and settlement of trade payables during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; and 
 a decrease in Net earnings, excluding the non-cash impacts of the gain of 508 million recognized on the formation of the Nutrinova joint venture during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (see Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information) and deferred income taxes of 294 million. 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 376 million to 342 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 34 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 a cash inflow of 461 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the formation of the Nutrinova joint venture (see Note 3 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information), which did not recur in the current year; 
 partially offset by: 
 a decrease of 110 million in capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased 92 million to 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 1.2 billion for the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 a decrease in payments on long-term debt, primarily due to our cash tender offer of 2.25 billion completed in August 2023, payment in full of delayed-draw term loans of 750 million and repayment at maturity of the 1.125 senior unsecured notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, that did not recur in the current year, partially offset by repayments at maturity of the 5.900 and 3.500 senior unsecured notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; and 
 a decrease in net payments on short-term debt, primarily driven by a payment of 500 million on our March 2022 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined below) during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which did not recur in the current year and an increase in net proceeds on our revolving credit facilities of 46 million; 
 partially offset by: 
 a decrease in proceeds of long-term debt, primarily due to the issuance of certain senior unsecured notes of 3.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, that did not recur in the current year partially offset by current year borrowings on working capital loan facilities in China; and 
 an increase in net payments on our China Working Capital Term Loan Agreement (defined below). 
 Debt and Other Obligations 
 Senior Credit Facilities 
 In March 2022, we entered into a term loan credit agreement (as amended to date, the "March 2022 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which lenders provided a tranche of delayed-draw term loans due 5 years from issuance in an amount equal to 1.0 billion (the "5-year Term Loans"). 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 Also in March 2022, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement (as amended to date, the "U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement" and, together with the March 2022 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement the "U.S. Credit Agreements") consisting of a 1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit), maturing in 2027. 
 In August 2023, we amended certain covenants in the March 2022 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement to permit refinancing of certain senior notes without requiring a mandatory prepayment under the March 2022 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
 On November 1, 2024, February 16, 2024 and February 21, 2023, we amended certain covenants in the U.S. Credit Agreements, including financial ratio maintenance covenants. 
 The U.S. Credit Agreements are guaranteed by Celanese, Celanese U.S. and domestic subsidiaries together representing substantially all of our U.S. assets and business operations (the "Subsidiary Guarantors"). 
 In January 2023, Celanese (Shanghai) International Trading Co., Ltd ("CSIT"), a fully consolidated subsidiary, entered into a restatement of an existing credit facility agreement (the "China Revolving Credit Agreement") to upsize and modify the facility thereunder to consist of an aggregate CNY1.75 billion uncommitted senior unsecured revolving credit facility available under two tranches (with overdraft, bank guarantee and documentary credit sublimits) (the "CSIT January 2023 Facility", and together with any other revolving credit facilities available to our subsidiaries in China, the "China Revolving Credit Facilities"). Obligations bear interest at certain fixed and floating rates. On April 7, 2024, the CSIT January 2023 Facility was reduced to CNY750 million. The China Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese U.S. 
 Also in January 2023, CSIT entered into a senior unsecured working capital loan contract for CNY800 million (the "China Working Capital Term Loan Agreement"), payable 12 months from withdrawal date and bearing interest at 0.5 less than certain interbank rates. The loan under the China Working Capital Term Loan Agreement was fully drawn in January 2023 and was fully repaid during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 
 In December 2023, Celanese (Nanjing) Chemical Co., Ltd. ("CNC") entered into a senior unsecured working capital loan agreement for CNY800 million, payable on December 25, 2026 and bearing interest at 2.8 (the "CNC Working Capital Loan Agreement"). The loan under the CNC Working Capital Loan Agreement was fully drawn during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 
 On June 28, 2024, CNC entered into a senior unsecured working capital loan agreement for CNY800 million, payable in installments until June 28, 2027 and bearing interest at 2.75 (the "CNC Three Year Working Capital Loan Agreement," together with the China Revolving Credit Agreement, the China Working Capital Term Loan Agreement and the CNC Working Capital Loan Agreement, the "China Credit Agreements," and the China Credit Agreements together with the U.S. Credit Agreements, the "Global Credit Agreements"). The CNC Three Year Working Capital Loan Agreement was partially drawn during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect the China Credit Agreements will continue to facilitate our efficient repatriation of cash to the U.S. to repay debt and effectively redomicile a portion of our U.S. debt to China at a lower average interest rate. 
 On November 1, 2024, we entered into a senior unsecured term loan credit agreement (the "November 2024 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which the lenders provided a delayed-draw term loan due 364 days from the date of borrowing in an amount up to 1.0 billion. Amounts outstanding under the November 2024 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement will accrue interest at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate with an interest period of one or three months ("Term SOFR") plus a margin of 1.300 to 2.250 per annum, or the base rate plus a margin of 0.300 to 1.250 , in each case, based on our senior unsecured debt rating, subject to further changes based on such ratings. The commitments under the November 2024 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement will terminate by March 15, 2025. The loan under the November 2024 U.S. Term Loan Credit Agreement was not drawn prior to issuance date of this Form 10-Q. 
 There have been no material changes to our debt or other obligations described in our 2023 Form 10-K other than those disclosed above and in Note 7 - Debt in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements.

 Accounts Receivable Purchasing Facility 
 In June 2023, we entered into an amendment to the amended and restated receivables purchase agreement under our U.S. accounts receivable purchasing facility among certain of our subsidiaries, our wholly-owned, "bankruptcy remote" special purpose subsidiary ("SPE") and certain global financial institutions ("Purchasers"). We de-recognized 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion of accounts receivable under this agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and collected 1.1 billion and 1.3 billion of accounts receivable sold under this agreement during the same periods. Unsold U.S. accounts receivable of 155 million were pledged by the SPE as collateral to the Purchasers as of September 30, 2024. 
 Factoring and Discounting Agreements 
 We have factoring agreements in Europe, Singapore and China with financial institutions. We de-recognized 508 million and 423 million of accounts receivable under these factoring agreements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and collected 481 million and 407 million of accounts receivable sold under these factoring agreements during the same periods. 
 We have master discounting agreements (the "Master Discounting Agreements") with financial institutions in China to discount, on a non-recourse basis, banker's acceptance drafts, classified as accounts receivable. We received 83 million and 45 million from the accounts receivable transferred under the Master Discounting Agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Covenants 
 The Company's material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, such as events of default and change of control provisions, and in the case of the U.S. Credit Agreements the maintenance of certain financial ratios (subject to adjustment following certain qualifying acquisitions and dispositions, as set forth in the U.S. Credit Agreements, as amended). Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. 
 We are in compliance with the covenants in our material financing arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 
 See Note 7 - Debt in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Guarantor Financial Information 
 We have outstanding senior unsecured notes, issued in public offerings registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (collectively, the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese U.S. ("Issuer") and are guaranteed by Celanese Corporation ("Parent Guarantor") and the Subsidiary Guarantors (collectively the "Obligor Group"). See Note 7 - Debt in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information. The Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors are 100 owned subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor. The Subsidiary Guarantors are listed in Exhibit 22.1 to this Quarterly Report. 
 The Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors have guaranteed the Senior Notes on a full and unconditional, joint and several, senior unsecured basis. The guarantees are subject to certain customary release provisions, including that a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its respective guarantee in specified circumstances, including (i) the sale or transfer of all of its assets or capital stock; (ii) its merger or consolidation with, or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to, another person; or (iii) its ceasing to be a majority-owned subsidiary of the Issuer in connection with any sale of its capital stock or other transaction. Additionally, a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the Senior Notes at such time that it ceases to guarantee the Issuer's obligations under the U.S. Credit Agreements (subject to the satisfaction of customary document delivery requirements). The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under their guarantees are limited as necessary to prevent such guarantees from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. 
 The Parent Guarantor and the Issuer are holding companies that conduct substantially all of their operations through their subsidiaries, which own substantially all of our consolidated assets. The Parent Guarantor holds the stock of its immediate 100 owned subsidiary, the Issuer, but has no material consolidated assets. The principal source of cash to pay the Parent Guarantor's and the Issuer's obligations, including obligations under the Senior Notes and the guarantee of the Issuer's obligations under the U.S. Credit Agreements, is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors and our non-guarantor subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, applicable 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 country or state laws, regulatory limitations and terms of other debt instruments may limit our subsidiaries' ability to distribute cash to the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor. 
 For cash management purposes, we transfer cash among the Parent Guarantor, Issuer, Subsidiary Guarantors and non-guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. While the non-guarantor subsidiaries do not guarantee the Issuer's obligations under our outstanding debt, the transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Senior Notes, the U.S. Credit Agreements, other outstanding debt, Common Stock dividends and Common Stock repurchases. 
 The summarized financial information of the Obligor Group is presented below on a combined basis after the elimination of: (i) intercompany transactions among such entities and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in the non-guarantor subsidiaries. Transactions with, and amounts due to or from, non-guarantor subsidiaries and affiliates are separately disclosed.

 Share Capital 
 On October 17, 2024, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.70 per share on our Common Stock amounting to 76 million. The cash dividend will be paid on November 13, 2024 to holders of record as of October 30, 2024. As disclosed above, on November 4, 2024, we announced our intent to reduce our quarterly dividend by approximately 95 percent beginning in the first quarter of 2025. 
 There have been no material changes to our share capital described in our 2023 Form 10-K other than those disclosed above and in Note 10 - Shareholders' Equity in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements.

 Contractual Obligations 
 We have not entered into any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Except as otherwise described in this report, there have been no material revisions outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations as described in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Tax Return Audits 
 Our tax returns have been under joint audit for the years 2013 through 2015 by the United States, Netherlands and Germany (the "Authorities"). The Company and the Authorities were unable to reach an agreement jointly and therefore the audits continued on a separate jurisdictional basis. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we concluded settlement discussions with the Dutch tax authority. In the third quarter of 2024, we concluded settlement discussions with the German tax authority related to the German transfer pricing audit. In addition, our income tax returns in Mexico are under audit for the year 2018, in Canada for the years 2016 through 2022, and in the United States for the years 2016 through 2020. In August 2023, we negotiated a partial settlement with the Mexico tax authority for its audit for the year 2018. The partial settlement did not have a material impact on income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. In September 2023, the Canadian tax authority opened tax audits for the years 2019 through 2022, and the audits are in the preliminary stages. The audit in the United States for the years 2016 through 2020 is in the data gathering phase. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we believe that an adequate provision for income taxes has been made for all open tax years related to the examinations by governmental authorities. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues raised by the government authorities are resolved in a manner inconsistent with our expectations or we are unsuccessful in defending our positions, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. If required, any such adjustments could be material to the statements of operations and cash flows in the period(s) recorded. See Note 11 - Income Taxes in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Business Environment 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we experienced challenging demand conditions across several end-markets, including rapid and acute downturns in the Western Hemisphere automotive and industrial end-markets, impacting our Engineering Materials segment, as well as persistent demand weakness in paints, coatings, and construction, impacting our Acetyl Chain segment. Demand conditions and incremental industry production capacity resulted in elevated industry competitive dynamics and continuing pricing pressure across end-markets. While the macroeconomic challenges we are facing are not unique to Celanese, we remain committed to identifying and implementing actions to improve long-term growth and value creation. 
 We expect demand conditions to temporarily worsen in the fourth quarter of 2024, as automotive and industrial end-markets react to recent dynamics by destocking, which we expect to be largely contained to the fourth quarter of 2024. We will also continue to closely monitor the impact of, and responses to, geopolitical effects on demand conditions and the supply chain. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of Net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results. 
 We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K. We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates in MD A in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims and investigations incidental to the normal conduct of its business, relating to such matters as product liability, land disputes, insurance coverage disputes, contracts, employment, antitrust and competition, intellectual property, personal injury and other actions in tort, workers' compensation, chemical exposure, asbestos exposure, taxes, trade compliance, acquisitions and divestitures, claims of current and legacy shareholders, past waste disposal practices and release of chemicals into the environment. The Company is actively defending those matters where it is named as a defendant.

 List of Guarantor Subsidiaries 
 (As of September 30, 2024)
