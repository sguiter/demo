We disclaim any obligations to, and do not intend to, update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.

 Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and expanded interim disclosures. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted.

percent interest in the Northeast JV, a subsidiary that is a VIE due to certain of our voting rights being disproportionate to our obligation to absorb losses and substantially all of the Northeast JV s activities being performed on our behalf. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Northeast JV s economic performance. The Northeast JV provides midstream services for producers in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale regions. Future expansion activity is expected to be funded with capital contributions from us and the other equity partner on a proportional basis. 
 Gulfstar One 
 We own a percent interest in Gulfstar One, a subsidiary that, due to certain risk-sharing provisions in its customer contracts, is a VIE. Gulfstar One includes a proprietary floating-production system, Gulfstar FPS, and associated pipelines that provide production handling and gathering services in the eastern deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Gulfstar One s economic performance. 
 Cardinal 
 We own a percent interest in Cardinal, a subsidiary that provides gathering services for the Utica Shale region and is a VIE due to certain risks shared with customers. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Cardinal s economic performance. In order to meet contractual gas gathering commitments, we may fund more than our proportional share of future expansion activity, which could ultimately impact relative ownership.

Assets acquired, acquisition-related costs incurred, and results of operations realized are included within our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment. 
 During the period from the acquisition date of August 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024, the operations acquired in the Discovery Acquisition contributed Revenues of million and Modified EBITDA (as defined in Note 10 Segment Disclosures) of million. 
 We accounted for the Discovery Acquisition as a business combination, which requires, among other things, that identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition date fair values. The book value of our existing equity-method investment prior to the acquisition date of August 1, 2024, was million. We recognized a million gain on remeasuring our existing equity-method investment to fair value included in Other investing income (loss) net in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is not included in the pro forma Discovery adjustments below. We utilized the income approach to fair value our previous equity-method investment in Discovery.

 Other intangible assets recognized in the Cureton Acquisition are related to contractual customer relationships from gas gathering and processing agreements with our customers. The basis for determining the value of these intangible assets is estimated future net cash flows to be derived from acquired contractual customer relationships discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an initial period of years which represents the term over which the contractual customer relationships are expected to contribute to our cash flows. Approximately percent of the expected future revenues from these contractual customer relationships are impacted by our ability and intent to renew or renegotiate existing customer contracts. We expense costs incurred to renew or extend the terms of our gas gathering contracts with customers. Based on the estimated future revenues during the current contract periods (as estimated at the time of the acquisition), the weighted-average period prior to the next renewal or extension of the existing contractual customer relationships is approximately years.

billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024. we entered into additional agreements totaling million of notional value and terminated agreements totaling billion of notional value coinciding with issuances of long-term debt (see Note 6 Debt and Banking Arrangements). At September 30, 2024, we hold interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million. The fair value of these derivatives is determined using discounted cash flows considering forward interest rates and the terms of the agreements, corroborated by counterparty valuations, and is classified as a Level 2 measurement. We designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges to reduce interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. Gains and losses on these derivative instruments are reflected as a component of AOCI and, after the termination of the swap agreement, are amortized to earnings over the term of the related debt as a component of Interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income. These forward starting interest rate swaps are reported in Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Contingent Features 
 Generally, collateral may be provided in the form of a parent guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. If collateral is required, fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral are offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty. 
 We have specific trade and credit contracts that contain minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non-investment grade status. Under such circumstances, we would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with these counterparties. At September 30, 2024, the contractually required collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade to non-investment grade status was million. 
 We maintain accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, we may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At September 30, 2024, net cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was million.

 million for these matters, as discussed below. Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. At September 30, 2024, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other governmental authorities, and other factors. 
 The EPA and various state regulatory agencies routinely propose and promulgate new rules and issue updated guidance to existing rules. These rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, reviews and updates to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and rules for new and existing source performance standards for volatile organic compound and methane. We continuously monitor these regulatory changes and how they may impact our operations. Implementation of new or modified regulations may result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to Property, plant, and equipment net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas; however, due to regulatory uncertainty on final rule content and applicability timeframes, we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost of these regulatory impacts at this time.

 million for these costs and expect to recover approximately million through rates. 
 We also accrue environmental remediation costs for natural gas underground storage facilities, primarily related to soil and groundwater contamination. At September 30, 2024, we have accrued liabilities totaling million for these costs. 
 Former operations 
 We have potential obligations in connection with assets and businesses we no longer operate. These potential obligations include remediation activities at the direction of federal and state environmental authorities and the indemnification of the purchasers of certain of these assets and businesses for environmental and other liabilities existing at the time the sale was consummated. At September 30, 2024, we have accrued environmental liabilities of million related to these matters. 
 Other Divestiture Indemnifications 
 Pursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. 
 At September 30, 2024, other than as previously disclosed, we are not aware of any material claims against us involving the above-described indemnities. Any claim for indemnity brought against us in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the claim is made. 
 In addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are pending against us that are incidental to our operations, none of which are expected to be material to our expected future annual results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. 
 Summary 
 We have disclosed our estimated range of reasonably possible losses for certain matters above, as well as all significant matters for which we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. We estimate that for all other matters for which we are able to reasonably estimate a range of loss, our aggregate reasonably possible losses beyond amounts accrued are immaterial to our expected future annual results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. These calculations have been made without consideration of any potential recovery from third parties.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 We are an energy company committed to being the leader in providing infrastructure that safely delivers natural gas products to reliably fuel the clean energy economy. Our operations are located in the United States. 
 Our interstate natural gas pipeline strategy is to create value by maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing high-quality, low-cost transportation of natural gas to large and growing markets. Our gas pipeline businesses interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. The rates are established primarily through the FERC s ratemaking process, but we also may negotiate rates with our customers pursuant to the terms of our tariffs and FERC policy. Changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have limited near-term impact on these revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates. 
 The ongoing strategy of our midstream operations is to safely and reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. We focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers. These services include natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and storage, NGL fractionation, transportation and storage, crude oil production handling and transportation, as well as marketing services for NGL, crude oil, and natural gas. 
 Consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources, our operations are conducted, managed, and presented within the following reportable segments: Transmission Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G P, West, and Gas NGL Marketing Services. All remaining business activities, including our upstream operations and corporate activities, are included in Other. Our reportable segments are comprised of the following business activities: 
 Transmission Gulf of Mexico is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipelines, Transco, Northwest Pipeline, and MountainWest, and their related natural gas storage facilities, as well as natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast region, includ ing a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One, a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, and Discovery, a former 60 percent equity-method investment in which we acquired the remaining ownership interest in August 2024 (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures) . Transmission Gulf of Mexico also includes natural gas storage facilities and pipelines providing services in north Texas, and also in Louisiana and Mississippi related to the January 2024 Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). 
 Northeast G P is comprised of our midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania and New York, and the Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 65 percent interest in Northeast JV which operates in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, a 66 percent interest in Cardinal which operates in Ohio, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain, a 50 percent equity-method investment in Blue Racer, and Appalachia Midstream Investments. 
 West is comprised of our gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Wyoming, the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of east Texas and northwest Louisiana, the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko and Permian basins, and the DJ Basin of Colorado which includes RMM, a former 50 percent equity-method investment in which we acquired the remaining ownership interest in November 2023 (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). This segment also includes our NGL storage facilities, an undivided 50 percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, and a 50 percent equity-method investment in OPPL.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 

 Gas NGL Marketing Services is comprised of our NGL and natural gas marketing and trading operations, which includes risk management and transactions related to the storage and transportation of natural gas and NGLs on strategically positioned assets. 
 Unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of this Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 dated February 21, 2024. 
 
 Dividends 
 In September 2024, we paid a regular quarterly dividend of 0.4750 per share. 
 
 Overview of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Net income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 302 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Further discussion of our results is found in this report in the Results of Operations. 
 Recent Developments 
 Transco FERC Rate Case Filing 
 On August 30, 2024, Transco filed a general rate case with the FERC for an overall increase in rates. In September 2024, with the exception of certain rates that reflected a rate decrease, the FERC accepted and suspended our general rate filing to be effective March 1, 2025, subject to refund and the outcome of hearing procedures established by the FERC. The specific rates that reflected a rate decrease were accepted, without suspension, to be effective October 1, 2024, as requested by Transco, and will not be subject to refund. The impact of the rates reflecting a rate decrease is expected to reduce revenues by approximately 1 million per month beginning October 1, 2024. 
 Expansion Project Updates 
 Transmission Gulf of Mexico 
 Regional Energy Access 
 In January 2023, we received approval from the FERC for the project to expand Transco s existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from receipt points in northeastern Pennsylvania to multiple delivery points in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. We placed approximately half of the project into service in the fourth quarter of 2023 and placed the remainder of the project into service in August 2024. The project increased capacity by 829 Mdth/d. 
 On July 30, 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted petitions for review of the FERC orders approving the project, vacating such orders and remanding the matter to the FERC for appropriate action. The court s decision will not be effective until the court has issued its mandate, which is not expected to occur until November 2024 at the earliest. To enable us to continue operating the project facilities and capacity until the FERC issues an order on remand from the court s decision, on September 6, 2024, we filed an application with the FERC for a temporary certificate.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 

 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 Discovery Acquisition 
 As of December 31, 2023, we owned a 60 percent interest in Discovery, which we accounted for as an equity-method investment. On August 1, 2024, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 40 percent interest in Discovery, along with certain other assets, for 170 million cash, subject to working capital and post-closing adjustments. As a result of acquiring this additional interest, we obtained control and now consolidate Discovery. We recognized a 127 million gain on remeasuring our existing equity-method investment to fair value included in Other investing income (loss) net in our Consolidated Statement of Income in the third quarter of 2024. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand our gathering, processing, and transportation presence in the Gulf of Mexico region. Discovery continues to be reported within our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). 
 Sale of Aux Sable Interest 
 Also on August 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our equity-method investments in Aux Sable in our Northeast G P segment for total consideration of 161 million. As a result of this sale, we recorded a gain of 149 million included in Other investing income (loss) net in our Consolidated Statement of Income in the third quarter of 2024 (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). 
 Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition 
 On January 3, 2024, we closed on the acquisition of 100 percent of a strategic portfolio of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, located in Louisiana and Mississippi, from Hartree Partners LP for 1.95 billion. The purpose of this acquisition, which is reported in the Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment, was to expand our natural gas storage footprint in the Gulf Coast region. The Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition was funded with cash on hand and 100 million of deferred consideration (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). 
 
 Company Outlook 
 Our strategy is to provide a large-scale, reliable, and clean energy infrastructure designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the United States. We accomplish this by connecting the growing demand for cleaner fuels and feedstocks with our major positions in the premier natural gas and natural gas products supply basins. We continue to maintain a strong commitment to safety, environmental stewardship including seeking opportunities for renewable energy ventures, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. We believe that accomplishing these goals will position us to deliver safe, reliable, clean energy services to our customers and an attractive return to our shareholders. Our business plan for 2024 includes a continued focus on earnings and cash flow growth. 
 
 In 2024, our operating results are expected to benefit from the recent Gulf Coast Storage and DJ Basin acquisitions. We also anticipate increases resulting from Transmission Gulf of Mexico expansion projects, including the Regional Energy Access project, and annual inflation-based rate increases across our gathering and processing business. These increases are partially offset by lower expected Gas NGL Marketing Services results, the absence of realized hedge gains captured in 2023 in the West, and a decrease in expected volumes primarily in the Appalachian and Haynesville basins associated with a lower expected commodity price environment. 
 
 We seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity, as well as manage a diversified portfolio of safe, clean, and reliable energy infrastructure assets that continue to serve key growth markets and supply basins in the United States. Our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2024 are expected to range from 1.45 billion to 1.75 billion, excluding acquisitions. Growth capital spending in 2024 primarily includes Transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, projects supporting growth in the Haynesville Basin,

 and projects supporting the Northeast G P business. We also expect to invest capital in our Other business ventures. In addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that reduce emissions, and meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments. 
 Potential risks and obstacles that could impact the execution of our plan include: 
 A global recession, which could result in downturns in financial markets and commodity prices, as well as impact demand for natural gas and related products; 
 Opposition to, and regulations affecting, our infrastructure projects, including the risk of delay or denial in permits and approvals needed for our projects; 
 Counterparty credit and performance risk; 
 Unexpected significant increases in capital expenditures or delays in capital project execution, including increases from inflation or delays caused by supply chain disruptions; 
 Unexpected changes in customer drilling and production activities, which could negatively impact gathering and processing volumes; 
 Lower than anticipated demand for natural gas and natural gas products which could result in lower-than-expected volumes, energy commodity prices, and margins; 
 General economic, financial markets, or industry downturns, including increased inflation and interest rates; 
 Physical damages to facilities, including damage to offshore facilities by weather-related events; 
 Other risks set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, as may be supplemented by disclosure in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 Expansion Projects 
 Our ongoing major expansion projects include the following: 
 Transmission Gulf of Mexico 
 Deepwater Shenandoah Project 
 In June 2021, we reached an agreement with two third-parties to provide offshore natural gas gathering and transportation services as well as onshore natural gas processing services. The project expands our existing Gulf of Mexico offshore infrastructure via a 5-mile offshore lateral pipeline from the Shenandoah platform to Discovery s existing Keathley Canyon Connector pipeline, adds onshore processing facilities at Larose, Louisiana to handle the expected rich Shenandoah production, and the natural gas liquids will be fractionated and marketed at Discovery s Paradis plant in Louisiana. We plan to place the project into service in the second quarter of 2025. 
 Deepwater Whale Project 
 In August 2021, we reached an agreement with two third-parties to provide offshore natural gas gathering and crude oil transportation services as well as onshore natural gas processing services. The project expands our existing Western Gulf of Mexico offshore infrastructure via a 26-mile gas lateral pipeline from the Whale platform to the existing Perdido gas pipeline and adds a new 125-mile oil pipeline from the Whale platform to our existing junction platform. We plan to place the project into service in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Service revenues increased primarily due to higher volumes from the November 2023 DJ Basin Acquisitions at our West segment and the January 2024 Gulf Coast Storage and the August 2024 Discovery Acquisitions at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures), and higher revenues associated with an expansion project at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment; partially offset by lower gathering volumes at our West and Northeast G P segments. 
 The net sum of Product sales and service revenues commodity consideration , Product costs and net processing commodity expenses, and net realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives related to sales of product and shrink gas purchases for our processing plants for our reportable segments comprise our Commodity Margins . Service revenues - commodity consideration represent payments we receive in the form of commodities for processing services provided. Most of these commodity volumes are sold during the month processed and are offset within Product costs and net processing commodity expenses . The sum of Product sales and net realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives related to our upstream operations comprise Net realized product sales . 
 The Product sales and service revenues commodity consideration decrease primarily consists of: 
 Lower product sales from our upstream operations at Other; 
 Lower equity NGL sales and commodity consideration revenues associated with our NGL production activity primarily at our West segment; 
 Lower system management gas sales primarily at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment; partially offset by 
 Higher marketing sales activities primarily at our West segment; partially offset by lower marketing activities related to NGLs at our Gas NGL Marketing Services segment. 
 As we are acting as agent for natural gas marketing customers, our natural gas marketing product sales are presented net of the related costs of those activities within our Gas NGL Marketing Services segment. 
 Net gain (loss) from commodity derivatives includes realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments reflected within Total revenues primarily in our Gas NGL Marketing Services and West segments, and at Other (see Note 8 Commodity Derivatives). 
 We experience significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage capacity portfolios as well as upstream-related production. However, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are generally offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying production or transportation and storage capacity contracts, which are not recognized until the underlying transaction occurs. 
 The Product costs and net processing commodity expenses increase primarily consists of: 
 Higher marketing activities primarily at our West segment; partially offset by lower marketing activities primarily related to NGLs at our Gas NGL Marketing Services segment; partially offset by 
 Lower shrink natural gas purchases and commodity consideration costs associated with our equity NGL production activities primarily at our West segment; 
 Lower system management gas purchases primarily at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment. 
 Operating and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to employee-related costs, including the impact of a change in a payroll policy; and operating costs of the assets acquired at our West and Transmission Gulf of Mexico segments.

 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily related to assets acquired at our West and Transmission Gulf of Mexico segments. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to employee-related costs, including the impact of a change in a payroll policy. 
 Gain on sale of business reflects a gain from the sale of certain liquids pipelines in our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment in 2023 (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). 
 Other (income) expense net within Operating income (loss) includes lower project feasibility costs at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment. 
 Equity earnings (losses) changed favorably primarily due to the absence of our share of a loss contingency accrual in 2023 at Aux Sable, partially offset by the impacts of the sale of our interests in Aux Sable and the consolidations of RMM and Discovery following our acquisitions of the remaining ownership interests (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). 
 Other investing income (loss) net includes a 149 million gain on the sale of our interests in Aux Sable and a 127 million gain on remeasurement of our existing equity-method investment associated with the purchase of the remaining interest in Discovery. 
 The increase in Interest expense was primarily due to our 2023 and 2024 debt issuances, and imputed interest on deferred consideration obligations related to our DJ Basin and Gulf Coast Storage Acquisitions, partially offset by 2023 and 2024 debt retirements (see Note 6 Debt and Banking Arrangements). 
 Provision (benefit) for income taxes changed unfavorably primarily due to higher pre-tax income and the absence of a benefit associated with decreases in our estimate of the state deferred income tax rate in 2023. See Note 5 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Service revenues increased primarily due to higher volumes from the November 2023 DJ Basin Acquisitions at our West segment and the January 2024 Gulf Coast Storage, February 2023 MountainWest and August 2024 Discovery Acquisitions at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment, and higher revenues associated with an expansion project at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment, partially offset by lower gathering volumes at our West and Northeast G P segments and the September 2023 sale of certain liquids pipelines at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment. 
 The Product sales and service revenues commodity consideration decrease primarily consists of: 
 Lower system management gas sales primarily at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment; 
 Lower equity NGL sales and commodity consideration revenues associated with our NGL production activity primarily at our West segment; 
 Lower product sales from upstream operations at Other; partially offset by 
 Higher marketing sales activities primarily at our West segment; partially offset by lower marketing sales activities primarily related to NGLs at our Gas NGL Marketing Services segment. Net natural gas marketing sales were impacted by lower net prices, higher storage costs, and a favorable change in lower of cost or net realizable inventory adjustments.

 Other investing income (loss) net includes gains on the sale of our interests in Aux Sable and associated with the purchase of the remaining interest in Discovery, as previously discussed. 
 The increase in Interest expense was primarily due to our 2023 and 2024 debt issuances, and imputed interest on deferred consideration obligations related to our DJ Basin and Gulf Coast Storage Acquisitions, partially offset by 2023 and 2024 debt retirements. 
 The favorable change in Other income (expense) net below Operating income (loss) includes an increase in equity allowance for funds used during construction (equity AFUDC) at our Transmission Gulf of Mexico segment. 
 Provision (benefit) for income taxes changed favorably primarily due to lower pre-tax income. 
 Income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2023 includes a pre-tax charge of 116 million to increase the accrued liability associated with our Alaska refinery contamination litigation, partially offset by the related income tax effect.

 Period-Over-Period Operating Results Segments 
 We evaluate segment operating performance based upon Modified EBITDA . Note 10 Segment Disclosures includes a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to Net income (loss) . Management uses Modified EBITDA because it is an accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets. Modified EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 West Modified EBITDA increased primarily due to higher Service revenues and Commodity margins, partially offset by higher Other segment costs and expenses, an unfavorable change in Net realized gain (loss) from commodity derivatives relating to service revenues, and lower Proportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments . 
 Service revenues increased primarily due to: 
 A 76 million increase in the DJ Basin region associated with the DJ Basin Acquisitions in November 2023 (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures); 
 A 7 million increase in our other NGL operations primarily associated with higher transportation revenue due to higher volumes; partially offset by 
 A 16 million decrease in the Haynesville Shale region primarily associated with lower gathering volumes from decreased producer activity; 
 An 8 million decrease in the Barnett Shale region primarily due to lower gathering volumes as well as lower gathering rates driven by unfavorable commodity pricing; 
 A 7 million decrease in the Eagle Ford Shale region primarily due to lower MVC revenues. 
 Net realized gain (loss) from commodity derivatives relating to service revenues is unfavorable due to the absence of realized hedge positions in third-quarter 2024. 
 Commodity margins increased 6 million primarily driven by higher marketing margins associated with the DJ Basin Acquisitions. 
 Other segment costs and expenses increased primarily due to higher operating expenses including those resulting from the DJ Basin Acquisitions and the impact of a change in a payroll policy. 
 Proportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments decreased primarily due to lower proportional results as RMM was consolidated following our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest on November 30, 2023, partially offset by higher volumes at OPPL.

 West Modified EBITDA increased primarily due higher Service revenues and Commodity margins, partially offset by higher Other segment costs and expenses, an unfavorable change in Net realized gain (loss) from commodity derivatives relating to service revenues, and lower Proportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments. 
 Service revenues increased primarily due to: 
 A 216 million increase in the DJ Basin region associated with the DJ Basin Acquisitions in November 2023, as previously discussed; 
 A 27 million increase in our other NGL operations associated with higher transportation and fractionation revenue due to higher volumes and higher storage fees primarily due to a new contract; 
 A 17 million increase in the Wamsutter region primarily associated with higher gathering volumes from increased producer activity as well as higher volumes associated with the absence of weather-related events in first-quarter 2023; partially offset by 
 A 32 million decrease in the Haynesville Shale region primarily due to lower gathering volumes from decreased producer activity, partially offset by higher gathering rates;

 A 25 million decrease in the Eagle Ford Shale region primarily due to lower MVC revenues as well as lower gathering volumes; 
 A 22 million decrease in the Barnett Shale region primarily due to lower gathering rates driven by unfavorable commodity pricing and lower gathering volumes. 
 Net realized gain (loss) from commodity derivatives relating to service revenues reflects an unfavorable change in settled commodity prices relative to our natural gas hedge positions. 
 Commodity margins increased 54 million primarily due to 30 million higher margins associated with the DJ Basin Acquisitions. Margins also increased 19 million from our equity NGLs due to lower net realized prices for natural gas purchases and lower volumes of natural gas purchased both associated with our equity NGL production activities; partially offset by lower volumes of equity NGL sold and lower net realized NGL sales prices. 
 Other segment costs and expenses increased primarily due to higher operating and employee-related expenses including those resulting from the DJ Basin Acquisitions, the impact of a change in a payroll policy, the absence of favorable contract settlements in first-quarter 2023, and an unfavorable change in our net imbalance liability due to changes in pricing. 
 Proportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments decreased primarily due to lower proportional results as RMM was consolidated on November 30, 2023 as previously discussed, partially offset by higher volumes at OPPL.

 Commodity margins decreased 15 million primarily due to a 17 million decrease in our NGL marketing margins including an unfavorable change in net realized gains and losses on sale of inventory in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by unfavorable changes in non-ethane prices. 
 Net unrealized gain (loss) from commodity derivative instruments within Segment revenues and Net processing commodity expenses relates to derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The change from 2023 is primarily due to a change in forward commodity prices relative to our hedge positions in 2024 compared to 2023.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Liquidity 
 
 Outlook 
 Our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2024 are expected to range from 1.45 billion to 1.75 billion, excluding acquisitions. Growth capital spending in 2024 primarily includes Transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, projects supporting growth in the Haynesville Basin, and projects supporting the Northeast G P business. We also expect to invest capital in our Other business ventures. In addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that reduce emissions, and meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments. We intend to fund substantially all planned 2024 capital spending with cash available after paying dividends. We retain the flexibility to adjust planned levels of growth capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in economic conditions or business opportunities including the repurchase of our common stock. 
 On November 1, 2024, we paid the remaining 651 million of the RMM purchase price obligation (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). 
 On August 1, 2024, we completed the Discovery Acquisition for 170 million. Also, on August 1, 2024, we completed the sale of certain equity-method investments for 161 million (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). 
 On January 3, 2024, we completed the Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition for 1.95 billion (see Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures). 
 Our long-term debt activity during the first nine months of 2024 included issuing 3.6 billion of new debt and retiring 2.25 billion of existing debt (see Note 6 Debt and Banking Arrangements). 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 2.284 billion of long-term debt due within one year. Our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include cash on hand, proceeds from refinancing, our credit facility, or our commercial paper program, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations. 
 Liquidity 
 Based on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage our businesses in 2024. Our potential material internal and external sources and uses of liquidity are as follows: 
 Sources: Cash and cash equivalents on hand Cash generated from operations Distributions from our equity-method investees Utilization of our credit facility and/or commercial paper program Cash proceeds from issuance of debt and/or equity securities Proceeds from asset monetizations Uses: Working capital requirements Capital and investment expenditures Product costs Gas NGL Marketing Services payments for transportation and storage capacity and gas supply Other operating costs including human capital expenses Quarterly dividends to our shareholders Repayments of borrowings under our credit facility and/or commercial paper program Debt service payments, including payments of long-term debt Distributions to noncontrolling interests Share repurchase program 
 55 

Table of Contents 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 

 As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 24.8 billion of long-term debt due after one year. Our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include cash generated from operations, proceeds from refinancing, our credit facility, or our commercial paper program, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations. 
 Potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity discussed above include those previously discussed in Company Outlook . 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 2.021 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt due within one year. Our available liquidity is as follows: 
 Available Liquidity September 30, 2024 (Millions) Cash and cash equivalents 762 Capacity available under our 3.75 billion credit facility, less amounts outstanding under our 3.5 billion commercial paper program (1) 3,750 4,512 
 __________ 
 (1) In managing our available liquidity, we do not expect a maximum outstanding amount in excess of the capacity of our credit facility inclusive of any outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program. We had no Commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Through September 30, 2024, the highest amount outstanding under our commercial paper program and credit facility during 2024 was 730 million. We expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants associated with our credit facility for the September 30, 2024, reporting period. 
 Dividends 
 We increased our regular quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders by approximately 6.1 percent from the 0.4475 per share paid in each quarter of 2023, to 0.4750 per share paid in the first three quarters of 2024. 
 
 Registrations 
 In February 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement as a well-known seasoned issuer. 
 
 Distributions from Equity-Method Investees 
 The organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require periodic distributions of their available cash to their members. In each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. 
 Credit Ratings 
 The interest rates at which we are able to borrow money are impacted by our credit ratings. The current ratings are as follows: 
 Rating Agency Outlook Senior Unsecured Debt Rating S P Global Ratings Positive 
 BBB Moody s Investors Service Stable Baa2 Fitch Ratings Stable BBB 
 In April 2024, S P Global Ratings changed its Outlook from Stable to Positive. 
 56 

Table of Contents 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 

 These credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. No assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment-grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their current criteria for investment-grade ratios. A downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our future cost of borrowing and, if ratings were to fall below investment-grade, could require us to provide additional collateral to third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. 
 Sources (Uses) of Cash 
 The following table summarizes the sources (uses) of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Notes referenced in the table): 
 Cash Flow Nine Months Ended September 30, Category 2024 2023 (Millions) Sources of cash and cash equivalents: Net cash provided (used) by operating activities

 Operating activities 
 The factors that determine operating activities are largely the same as those that affect Net income (loss) , with the exception of noncash items such as Depreciation and amortization , Provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes , Equity (earnings) losses , Net unrealized (gain) loss from commodity derivative instruments , Gain on sale of business, Gain on disposition of equity-method investments, Gain on consolidation of equity-method investments , Inventory write-downs, and Amortization of stock-based awards. 
 Our Net cash provided (used) by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased from the same period in 2023 primarily due to unfavorable changes in margin requirements and net operating working capital, partially offset by higher operating income (excluding non-cash items previously discussed).

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. Our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. Any borrowings under our credit facility and any issuances under our commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. The maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. We may utilize interest rate derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk associated with future debt issuances (see Note 6 Debt and Banking Arrangements). 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to commodity price risk through our natural gas and NGL marketing activities, including contracts to purchase, sell, transport, and store product. We routinely manage this risk with a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts such as forward contracts, futures contracts, and basis swaps, as well as physical transactions. Although many of the contracts used to manage commodity exposure are derivative instruments, these economic hedges are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
 We are also exposed to commodity prices through our upstream business and certain gathering and processing contracts. We use derivative instruments to lock in forward sales prices on a portion of our expected future production and to lock in NGL margin on a portion of our commodity-exposed gathering and processing volumes. These economic hedges are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. 
 The maturities of our commodity derivative contracts at September 30, 2024, were as follows: 
 Total Fair Value Maturity Fair Value Measurements of Assets (Liabilities) Using (1)

 _______________ 
 (1) See Note 7 Fair Value Measurements and Guarantees for discussion of valuation techniques by level within the fair value hierarchy. See Note 8 Commodity Derivatives for the amount of change in fair value recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 (2) Commodity derivative assets and liabilities exclude 76 million of net cash collateral in Level 1. 
 
 Value at Risk (VaR) 
 VaR is the maximum predicted loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability. Our VaR may not be comparable to that of other companies due to differences in the factors used to calculate VaR. Our VaR is determined using parametric models with 95 percent confidence intervals and one-day holding periods, which means that 95 percent of the time, the risk of loss in a day from a portfolio of positions is expected to be less than or equal to the amount of VaR calculated. Our open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of predicted financial loss to management. Because we generally manage physical gas assets and economically protect our positions by hedging in the futures markets, our open exposure is generally mitigated. We employ daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risk of our positions. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 We actively monitor open commodity marketing positions and the resulting VaR and maintain a relatively small risk exposure as total buy volume is close to sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. 
 The VaR associated with our integrated natural gas trading operations was 4 million at September 30, 2024 and 9 million at December 31, 2023. We had the following VaRs for the period shown: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 (Millions) Average 3 High 15 Low 1 
 Our non-trading portfolio primarily consists of commodity derivatives that hedge our upstream business and certain gathering and processing contracts. The VaR associated with these commodity derivatives was 5 million at September 30, 2024 and 3 million at December 31, 2023. We had the following VaRs for the period shown: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 (Millions) Average 4 High 8 Low 3 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) or our internal control over financial reporting (Internal Controls) will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that the Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls will be modified as systems change and conditions warrant. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable assurance level.

 As disclosed in Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures, we acquired Hartree as part of the Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition on January 3, 2024. Hartree s total revenues constituted approximately 2 percent of total revenues as shown in our consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Hartree s total assets constituted approximately 4 percent of total assets as shown in our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. We also acquired Cureton on November 30, 2023, and its total revenues constituted approximately 3 percent of total revenues as shown in our consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cureton s total assets constituted approximately 1 percent of total assets as shown in our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. We excluded Hartree s and Cureton s disclosure controls and procedures that are subsumed by their internal control over financial reporting from the scope of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. This exclusion is in accordance with the guidance issued by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of recent business combinations may be omitted from management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
