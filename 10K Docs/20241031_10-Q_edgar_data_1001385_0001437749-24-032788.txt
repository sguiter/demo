million of its outstanding common stock. The program does not commit to any particular timing or quantity of purchases, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Under the program, shares may be purchased in open market, including through plans adopted pursuant to Rule 10b5 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or in privately negotiated transactions administered by its broker, D.A. Davidson Companies. At this time, the Company has elected to limit its share repurchase transactions to only those under the Rule 10b5 1 trading plan it executed in November 2023, which designates up to million for daily share repurchases with volumes that fluctuate with changes in the trading price of its common stock.

active stock incentive plan for employees and directors, the 2022 Stock Incentive Plan, which provides for awards of stock options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted shares of common stock, restricted stock units RSUs ), and performance share awards PSAs ). In addition, the Company had one inactive stock incentive plan, the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, under which previously granted awards vested on April 1, 2024. 
 
 The Company recognizes the compensation cost of employee and director services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date estimated fair value of the awards. The Company estimates the fair value of RSUs and PSAs using the value of the Company s stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation cost is recognized over the period during which the employee or director is required to provide service in exchange for the award and, as forfeitures occur, the associated compensation cost recognized to date is reversed. For awards with performance-based payout conditions, the Company recognizes compensation cost based on the probability of achieving the performance conditions, with changes in expectations recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of change. Any recognized compensation cost is reversed if the conditions are ultimately not met. 
 
 The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded (in thousands):

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Awards 
 
 The Company s stock incentive plan provides for equity instruments, such as RSUs and PSAs, which grant the right to receive a specified number of shares at specified times. RSUs and PSAs are service-based awards that vest according to the terms of the grant. PSAs have performance-based payout conditions.

 For the PSAs vested on April 1, 2024, the actual number of common shares that were issued was determined by multiplying the PSAs at the target level of , as disclosed in this table, by a payout percentage based on the performance-based conditions achieved. The payout percentage was for the 2021 - 2023 performance period, for the 2022 - 2023 performance period, and for the 2023 performance period. 

The unvested balance of RSUs and PSAs as of September 30, 2024 includes approximately PSAs at the target level of . The vesting of these awards is subject to the achievement of specified performance-based conditions, and the actual number of common shares that will ultimately be issued will be determined by multiplying this number of PSAs by a payout percentage ranging from to . 
 
 Based on the estimated level of achievement of the performance targets associated with the PSAs as of September 30, 2024 , unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Company s RSUs and PSAs was million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. 
 
 Stock Awards 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , stock awards of shares and shares, respectively, were granted to non-employee directors, which vested immediately upon issuance. The Company recorded compensation expense based on the weighted-average fair market value per share of the awards on the grant date of in 2024 and in 2023 . 

potentially responsible parties known as the Lower Willamette Group under agreement with the EPA. The EPA finalized the remedial investigation report in 2016, and the feasibility study in 2016, which identified multiple remedial alternatives. In 2017, the EPA issued its Record of Decision selecting the remedy for cleanup at the Portland Harbor Superfund Site, which it believes will cost approximately billion at net present value and years to complete. The EPA has not yet determined who is responsible for the costs of cleanup or how the cleanup costs will be allocated among the more than potentially responsible parties. Because of the large number of potentially responsible parties and the variability in the range of remediation alternatives, the Company is unable to estimate an amount or an amount within a range of costs for its obligation with respect to the Portland Harbor Superfund Site matters, and no further adjustment to the Consolidated Financial Statements has been recorded as of the date of this filing. 
 
 The ODEQ is separately providing oversight of voluntary investigations and source control activities by the Company involving the Company s site, which are focused on controlling any current uplands releases of contaminants into the Willamette River. No liabilities have been established in connection with these investigations because the extent of contamination and the Company s responsibility for the contamination have not yet been determined. 
 
 Concurrent with the activities of the EPA and the ODEQ, the Portland Harbor Natural Resources Trustee Council Trustees sent some or all of the same parties, including the Company, a notice of intent to perform a Natural Resource Damage Assessment NRDA for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site to determine the nature and extent of natural resource damages under CERCLA Section 107. The Trustees for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site consist of representatives from several Northwest Indian Tribes, three federal agencies, and one state agency. The Trustees act independently of the EPA and the ODEQ. The Trustees have encouraged potentially responsible parties to voluntarily participate in the funding of their injury assessments and several of those parties have agreed to do so. In 2014, the Company agreed to participate in the injury assessment process, which included funding million of the assessment. The Company has not assumed any additional payment obligations or liabilities with the participation with the NRDA, nor does the Company expect to incur significant future costs in the resolution of the NRDA. 
 
 In 2017, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, a Trustee until they withdrew from the council in 2009, filed a complaint against the potentially responsible parties including the Company to recover costs related to their own injury assessment and compensation for natural resources damages. The case has been stayed until 2025, and the Company does not have sufficient information at this time to determine the likelihood of a loss in this matter or the amount of damages that could be allocated to the Company. 
 
 The Company has insurance policies for defense costs, as well as indemnification policies it believes will provide reimbursement for the remediation assessed. However, the Company can provide no assurance that those policies will cover all of the costs which the Company may incur. 
 
 All Sites 
 
 The Company operates its facilities under numerous governmental permits and licenses relating to air emissions, stormwater runoff, and other environmental matters. The Company s operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations thereunder which, among other requirements, establish noise and dust standards. The Company believes it is in material compliance with its permits and licenses and these laws and regulations, and the Company does not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Other Contingencies and Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, the Company is party to a variety of legal actions, including claims, suits, complaints, and investigations arising out of the ordinary course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage against potential claims in amounts that are believed to be adequate. To the extent that insurance does not cover legal, defense, and indemnification costs associated with a loss contingency, the Company records accruals when such losses are considered probable and reasonably estimable. The Company believes that it is not presently a party to legal actions, the outcomes of which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 Commitments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company s commitments include approximately million remaining relating to its investment in the primary component of the new reinforced concrete pipe mill which remained unpaid at September 30, 2024 and approximately million remaining relating to the final obligations associated with the construction of the building for the new mill at the Company s facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
 
 Guarantees 
 
 The Company has entered into certain letters of credit that total million as of September 30, 2024 . The letters of credit relate to workers compensation insurance and a public improvement project.

 Precast revenue for water infrastructure concrete pipe and precast concrete products is recognized at the time control is transferred to customers which is generally at the time of shipment, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products. All variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including contractual discounts, returns, and credits, is included in net sales. Estimates for variable consideration are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and management s judgment. The Company s contracts do not contain significant financing. 

Disaggregation of Revenue 
 
 The following table disaggregates revenue by recognition over time or at a point in time, as the Company believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors (in thousands):

Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities 
 
 Contract assets primarily represent revenue earned over time but not yet billable based on the terms of the contracts. These amounts will be billed based on the terms of the contracts, which can include certain milestones, partial shipments, or completion of the contracts. Payment terms of amounts billed vary based on the customer, but are typically due within 30 days of invoicing. Contract liabilities represent advance billings on contracts, typically for steel. 
 
 The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company s contract assets and contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company s performance and billings.

Overview 
 
 Northwest Pipe Company is a leading manufacturer of water-related infrastructure products, and operates in two segments, Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe SPP and Precast Infrastructure and Engineered Systems Precast ). For detailed descriptions of these segments, see Note 12, Segment Information of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements of this 2024 Q3 Form 10 Q. 
 
 In addition to being the largest manufacturer of engineered steel water pipeline systems in North America, we manufacture stormwater and wastewater technology products; high-quality precast and reinforced concrete products; pump lift stations; steel casing pipe, bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe, and one of the largest offerings of pipeline system joints, fittings, and specialized components. Strategically positioned to meet growing water and wastewater infrastructure needs, we provide solution-based products for a wide range of markets under the ParkUSA, Geneva Pipe and Precast, Permalok , and Northwest Pipe Company lines. Our diverse team is committed to safety, quality, and innovation while demonstrating our core values of accountability, commitment, and teamwork. We are headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, and have 13 manufacturing facilities across North America. 
 
 Our water infrastructure products are sold generally to installation contractors, who include our products in their bids to federal, state, and municipal agencies, privately-owned water companies, or developers for specific projects. We believe our sales are substantially driven by spending on urban growth and new water infrastructure with a recent trend towards spending on water infrastructure replacement, repair, and upgrade. Within the total range of products, our steel pipe best addresses the larger-diameter, higher-pressure pipeline applications, while our precast concrete products mainly serve stormwater and sanitary sewer systems. 
 
 Our Current Economic Environment 
 
 Demand for our Precast products is generally influenced by general economic conditions such as housing starts, population growth, interest rates, and rates of inflation. According to the United States Census Bureau, privately-owned housing starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4 million in September 2024 and 1.5 million in December 2023, and the population of the United States is expected to increase by approximately 2 million people in 2024. While these two indicators point to a strong housing market, particularly in Texas and Utah which are two of the five fastest growing markets in the United States according to the November 2022 Bluefield Research Insight Report U.S. Canada Municipal Water Outlook: Utility CAPEX OPEX Forecasts, 2022-2030 and the states in which our Precast manufacturing facilities are located, the current elevated federal funds rate could continue to temper demand for our precast products. 
 
 Our SPP projects are often planned for many years in advance, as we operate that business with a long-term time horizon for which the projects are sometimes part of 50 year build-out plans. While we experienced a relatively modest level of project bidding in 2023, 2024 has been an improved bidding environment and our backlog for SPP has remained elevated, and long-term demand for water infrastructure projects in the United States appears strong. Additionally, while our SPP business faces possible head winds from recessionary concerns in the broader domestic economy, we currently believe it more likely a modest increase in funding will be brought on by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal IIJA and the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the February 2024 Bluefield Research Insight Report Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act: Tracking the Spending, Q1 2024 , approximately 1 billion earmarked under the IIJA has currently been outlaid by the Federal Government to date, leaving most of the 55 billion spending package available; we expect to benefit from this spending late in the cycle due to the long project timelines. 
 
 Purchased steel typically represents approximately 35 of our SPP projects cost of sales, and higher steel costs generally result in higher selling prices and revenue; however, volatile fluctuations in steel markets can affect our business. SPP contracts are generally quoted on a fixed-price basis, and volatile steel markets can result in selling prices that no longer correlate to the cost available at the time of steel purchase. Our average price of purchased steel was 933 per ton in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to annual averages of 994 per ton in 2023 and 1,174 per ton in 2022. 
 
 Economic uncertainty, including the impacts of raw material shortages, inflationary pressures, potential risks of a recession, and disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our business. While the 2024 U.S. presidential election and overall domestic political outlook may result in volatility in financial markets, near-term changes in demand for our products are considered unlikely. The extent of the impact of these broader economic forces on our business will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales. Net sales increased 9.7 to 130.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 118.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 11.6 to 372.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 334.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 SPP net sales were 85.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 80.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 and 255.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 221.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. The 6.7 increase in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was driven by an 18 increase in tons produced resulting from an improved bidding environment coupled with changes in project timing, partially offset by a 9 decrease in selling price per ton due to lower raw materials costs. The 15.4 increase in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was driven by a 42 increase in tons produced resulting primarily from an improved bidding environment coupled with changes in project timing, partially offset by a 19 decrease in selling price per ton due to a combination of lower raw materials costs and product mix. Bidding activity, backlog, and production levels may vary significantly from period to period, thereby affecting sales volumes. 
 
 Precast net sales were 44.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 38.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 and 117.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 112.9 million in the first nine months of 2023 . The 15.8 increase in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was driven by a 35 increase in volume shipped, partially offset by a 14 decrease in selling prices due to changes in product mix. The 4.0 increase in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was driven by a 30 increase in volume shipped, partially offset by a 20 decrease in selling prices due to changes in product mix. 
 
 Gross profit. Gross profit increased 40.0 to 27.0 million (20.8 of net sales) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19.3 million (16.3 of net sales) in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 25.0 to 73.0 million (19.6 of net sales) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 58.4 million (17.5 of net sales) in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 SPP gross profit was 16.6 million (19.4 of SPP net sales) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 10.9 million (13.6 of SPP net sales) in the third quarter of 2023 and 47.9 million (18.7 of SPP net sales) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 31.3 million (14.1 of SPP net sales) in the first nine months of 2023. The 52.4 increase in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and the 53.1 increase in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 were primarily due to increased volume and changes in product mix. 
 
 Precast gross profit was 10.4 million (23.5 of Precast net sales) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8.4 million (21.9 of Precast net sales) in the third quarter of 2023 and 25.1 million (21.4 of Precast net sales) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 27.1 million (24.0 of Precast net sales) in the first nine months of 2023. The 24.0 increase in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to increased shipment volume. The 7.3 decrease in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to changes in product mix. 

Selling, general, and administrative expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased 13.1 to 11.6 million (8.9 of net sales) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 10.2 million (8.7 of net sales) in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 6.3 to 35.2 million (9.5 of net sales) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 33.1 million (9.9 of net sales) in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to 1.7 million in higher incentive compensation expense and 0.5 million in higher base compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by 0.7 million in lower professional fees. The increase in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to 2.3 million in higher incentive compensation expense and 0.7 million in higher base compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by 0.5 million in lower professional fees. 
 
 Income taxes. Income tax expense was 3.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 (an effective income tax rate of 26.3 compared to 2.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 (an effective income tax rate of 25.7 and was 8.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 (an effective income tax rate of 26.3 compared to 5.7 million in the first nine months of 2023 (an effective income tax rate of 26.6 ). The estimated effective income tax rates for the third quarters and the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were primarily impacted by non-deductible permanent differences. The estimated effective income tax rate can change significantly depending on the relationship of permanent income tax differences to estimated pre-tax income or loss. Accordingly, the comparison of estimated effective income tax rates between periods is not meaningful in all situations.

Table of Contents 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity generally include operating cash flows and the Credit Agreement dated June 30, 2021 with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo ), as administrative agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, including the initial sole lender, Wells Fargo (the Lenders ), as amended by the Incremental Amendment dated October 22, 2021, the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated April 29, 2022, and the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement dated June 29, 2023 (together, the Amended Credit Agreement ). From time to time our long-term capital needs may be met through the issuance of additional debt or equity. Our principal uses of liquidity generally include capital expenditures, working capital, organic growth initiatives, acquisitions, share repurchases, and debt service. Information regarding our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements of this 2024 Q3 Form 10 Q, and are further discussed below. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was 201.9 million compared to 176.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 5.7 million and 4.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Fluctuations in SPP working capital accounts result from timing differences between production, shipment, invoicing, and collection, as well as changes in levels of production and costs of materials. We typically have a relatively large investment in working capital, as we generally pay for materials, labor, and other production costs in the initial stages of a project, while payments from our customers are generally received after finished product is delivered. A portion of our revenues are recognized over time as the manufacturing process progresses; therefore, cash receipts typically occur subsequent to when revenue is recognized and the elapsed time between when revenue is recorded and when cash is received can be significant. As such, our payment cycle is a significantly shorter interval than our collection cycle, although the effect of this difference in the cycles may vary by project, and from period to period. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 60.7 million of outstanding revolving loan borrowings, 10.8 million of outstanding current debt, 86.9 million of operating lease liabilities, and 6.7 million of finance lease liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, we had 54.5 million of outstanding revolving loan borrowings, 10.8 million of outstanding current debt, 90.2 million of operating lease liabilities, and 7.5 million of finance lease liabilities. The increase in our revolving loan borrowings was primarily due to increased production and temporary changes in SPP working capital needs. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 18.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 44.4 million in the first nine months of 2023. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, provided 42.7 million of operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 32.0 million of operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2023. The net change in working capital was 23.8 million of operating cash flow that was used in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 12.4 million of operating cash flow that was provided in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 16.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 15.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. Capital expenditures were 16.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 13.2 million in the first nine months of 2023, which includes 1.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 3.1 million in the first nine months of 2023 of investment in our new reinforced concrete pipe mill, 4.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 for the construction of a building at our Salt Lake City, Utah facility for the new mill, and the remainder primarily for standard capital replacement. We currently expect capital expenditures in 2024 to be approximately 20 million to 22 million, which includes approximately 3 million of investment in our new reinforced concrete pipe mill, and associated ancillary equipment, approximately 5 million for the construction of a building at our Salt Lake City, Utah facility for the new mill, and the remainder primarily for standard capital replacement. The 2.7 million payment of the working capital adjustment for the 2021 acquisition of Park Environmental Equipment, LLC was made in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 0.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 28.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. Net borrowings (repayments) on the line of credit were 6.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 25.6) million in the first nine months of 2023. Repurchases of common stock were 4.4 million in the first nine months of 2024. No repurchases of common stock were made in the first nine months of 2023.

Table of Contents 

We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated by operations, and additional borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement and other loans will be adequate to fund our working capital, debt service, capital expenditure requirements, and share repurchases for the foreseeable future. To the extent necessary, we may also satisfy capital requirements through additional bank borrowings, senior notes, term notes, subordinated debt, and finance and operating leases, if such resources are available on satisfactory terms. We have from time to time evaluated and continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and expansion. Any such transactions, if consummated, may necessitate additional bank borrowings or other sources of funding. 
 
 On December 4, 2023, our shelf registration statement on Form S 3 (Registration No. 333 275691) covering the potential future sale of up to 150 million of our equity and/or debt securities or combinations thereof, was declared effective by the SEC. This shelf registration statement, which replaced the registration statement on Form S 3 that expired on November 3, 2023, provides another potential source of capital, in addition to other alternatives already in place. We cannot be certain that funding will be available on favorable terms or available at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience significant dilution. As of the date of this 2024 Q3 Form 10 Q, we have not yet sold any securities under this registration statement, nor do we have an obligation to do so. Please refer to the factors discussed in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10 K. 
 
 On November 2, 2023, we announced our authorization of a share repurchase program of up to 30 million of our outstanding common stock. The program does not commit to any particular timing or quantity of purchases, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Under the program, shares may be purchased in open market, including through plans adopted pursuant to Rule 10b5 1 of the Exchange Act, or in privately negotiated transactions administered by our broker, D.A. Davidson Companies. At this time, we have elected to limit our share repurchase transactions to only those under the Rule 10b5 1 trading plan we executed in November 2023, which we believe considers our liquidity, including availability of borrowings and covenant compliance under our Amended Credit Agreement, and other capital allocation priorities of the business. Our Rule 10b5 1 trading plan designates up to 10 million for daily share repurchases with volumes that fluctuate with changes in the trading price of our common stock. We expect to consider share repurchase strategies beyond the current Rule 10b5 1 trading plan at a future date. For a summary of shares repurchased during the third quarter of 2024, see Part II Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds of this 2024 Q3 Form 10 Q. Please refer to the factors discussed in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10 K. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a revolving loan, swingline loan, and letters of credit in the aggregate amount of up to 125 million Revolver Commitment ), with an option for us to increase that amount by 50 million, subject to provisions of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement will expire, and all obligations outstanding will mature, on June 29, 2028. We may prepay outstanding amounts at our discretion without penalty at any time, subject to applicable notice requirements. As of September 30, 2024 under the Amended Credit Agreement, we had 60.7 million of outstanding revolving loan borrowings, 1.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, and additional borrowing capacity of approximately 63 million. 
 
 Revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at rates related to, at our option and subject to the provisions of the Amended Credit Agreement, either: (i) Base Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus the Applicable Margin; (ii) Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Finance Rate SOFR (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus the Applicable Margin; or (iii) Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus the Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin is 1.75 to 2.35 , depending on our Consolidated Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and the interest rate option chosen. Interest on outstanding revolving loans is payable monthly. Swingline loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average interest rate for outstanding borrowings was 7.35 . The Amended Credit Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee of between 0.30 and 0.40 , based on the amount by which the Revolver Commitment exceeds the average daily balance of outstanding borrowings (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). Such fee is payable monthly in arrears. We are also obligated to pay additional fees customary for credit facilities of this size and type. 
 
 The letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2024 relate to workers compensation insurance and a public improvement project. Based on the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any material payments under these arrangements.

Table of Contents 

The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the Lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, annual capital expenditures, certain investments, acquisitions, and dispositions, and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The Amended Credit Agreement requires us to regularly provide financial information to Wells Fargo and to maintain a consolidated senior leverage ratio no greater than 3.00 to 1.00 (subject to certain exceptions) and a minimum consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) of at least 35 million for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended. Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, we have also agreed that we will not sell, assign, or otherwise dispose or encumber, any of our owned real property. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 30, 2024, and expect to continue to be in compliance in the near term. 
 
 Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a senior security interest in substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets. 
 
 Current Debt 
 
 The Interim Funding Agreement dated August 2, 2022 with Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. WFEF ), as amended January 23, 2023, March 15, 2023, July 21, 2023, and November 2, 2023 (together, the IFA ), provides for aggregate interim funding advances up to 10.8 million of equipment purchased for a new reinforced concrete pipe mill, to be converted into a term loan upon final delivery and acceptance of the financed equipment. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the IFA was 10.8 million, which was classified as a current liability since there was not a firm commitment for long-term debt financing. The IFA bears interest at the SOFR Average plus 2.00 . As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average interest rate for outstanding borrowings was 7.10 . The IFA requires monthly payments of accrued interest and grants a security interest in the equipment to WFEF. Effective November 2, 2023, the IFA requires us to maintain a consolidated senior leverage ratio no greater than 3.00 to 1.00 (subject to certain exceptions) and to maintain a minimum consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the IFA) of at least 35 million for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 30, 2024, and expect to continue to be in compliance in the near term. On October 28, 2024 we converted the IFA into a term loan with WFEF. See Note 14, Subsequent Event of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024.

Part II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are party to a variety of legal actions arising out of the ordinary course of business. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial results. We are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines, penalties, and other costs in substantial amounts. See Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements of this 2024 Q3 Form 10 Q.

The risks described in our 2023 Form 10 K and subsequent Form 10 Q s are not the only risks facing us. There are additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, that may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 On November 2, 2023, we announced our authorization of a share repurchase program of up to 30 million of our outstanding common stock. The program does not commit to any particular timing or quantity of purchases, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Under the program, shares may be purchased in open market, including through plans adopted pursuant to Rule 10b5 1 of the Exchange Act, or in privately negotiated transactions administered by our broker, D.A. Davidson Companies. At this time, we have elected to limit our share repurchase transactions to only those under the Rule 10b5 1 trading plan we executed in November 2023, which we believe considers our liquidity, including availability of borrowings and covenant compliance under our Amended Credit Agreement, and other capital allocation priorities of the business. Our Rule 10b5 1 trading plan designates up to 10 million for daily share repurchases with volumes that fluctuate with changes in the trading price of our common stock. We expect to consider share repurchase strategies beyond the current Rule 10b5 1 trading plan at a future date. 
 
 Pursuant to our share repurchase program, no repurchases of our common stock were made during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 24.9 million of the share repurchase authorization remained available for repurchases as of September 30, 2024. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , none of our directors or officers adopted, modified, or terminated a Rule 10b5 1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5 1 trading arrangement, as such terms are defined under Item 408 (a) of Regulation S K, except as follows: 
 
 O n August 19, 2024, Aaron Wilkins , our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Corporate Secretary , adopted a Rule 10b5 1 trading arrangement for the sale of shares of our common stock, which is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5 1 (c) under the Exchange Act. Mr. Wilkins Rule 10b5 1 trading arrangement provides for the potential sale of up to shares of our common stock between November 18, 2024 and April 30, 2025, so long as the market price of our common stock is higher than certain minimum threshold prices specified in Mr. Wilkins Rule 10b5 1 trading arrangement.

Promissory Note 

Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. | 600 South 4th Street | MAC N9300-100 | Minneapolis, MN 55415 

Notice: Lender reserves the right to withdraw the terms of this Promissory Note and issue a modified Promissory Note without notice to Debtor if Lender is not in receipt of a fully executed original or facsimile of this document within five (5) business days of the date of this Promissory Note. However, in that event, no such modifications will be binding on Debtor unless and until Debtor executes the modified document containing all such modifications. 

Contract Number 0011169-000 dated as of October 25, 2024 

For value received, the undersigned Debtor hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. (the Lender at such address as may be designated from time to time by Lender, in lawful money of the United States of America, the principal sum of 15,000,000.00 together with interest on the unpaid balance hereof from the date the loan proceeds are disbursed hereunder at an annual rate (computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed) determined as set forth below. 

The interest rate in effect on the loan proceeds disbursed hereunder shall be the rate per annum determined by Lender equal to (i) SOFR Average plus (ii) 2.22 . SOFR Average means the rate per annum determined by Lender as the compounded average of SOFR over a rolling thirty (30) calendar day period 30-Day SOFR Average ), for the day (such day, the SOFR Average Determination Day that is two (2) Business Days prior to the date of determination, as such rate is published by the SOFR Administrator on the SOFR Administrator s Website; provided, however, that (x) if as of 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on any SOFR Average Determination Day, such 30-Day SOFR Average has not been published on the SOFR Administrator s Website and a Benchmark Replacement Date with respect to SOFR Average has not occurred, then SOFR Average will be the 30-Day SOFR Average as published on the SOFR Administrator s Website for the first preceding Business Day for which such 30-Day SOFR Average was published on the SOFR Administrator s Website, so long as such first preceding Business Day is not more than three (3) Business Days prior to such SOFR Average Determination Day; and (y) if the SOFR Average determined as provided above (including pursuant to clause (x) of this proviso) shall ever be less than 0 (the Benchmark Floor ), then the SOFR Average shall be deemed to be the Benchmark Floor. SOFR means a rate per annum equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the SOFR Administrator. SOFR Administrator means the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or a successor administrator of the secured overnight financing rate). SOFR Administrator s Website means the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, currently at http://www.newyorkfed.org, or any successor source for the secured overnight financing rate identified as such by the SOFR Administrator from time to time. Business Day means any day except (i) a Saturday, (ii) a Sunday, or (iii) any day on which the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or any successor thereto, recommends that the fixed income departments of its members be closed for the entire day for purposes of trading in United States government securities. The rate shall initially be determined on the first day of the month in which the loan proceeds are disbursed hereunder and such initial rate shall remain in effect through the last day of the month in which the loan proceeds are disbursed hereunder. Unless the Default Rate (as defined below) shall apply, the interest rate in effect for each month thereafter until this Note is paid in full shall be the same percentage over SOFR Average, determined on the first day of each month (each such monthly period, an Interest Period ). Subject to the Benchmark Replacement Provisions below, if Lender determines (any determination of which shall be conclusive and binding on Debtor) that either (i) SOFR Average for the applicable Interest Period cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof other than as a result of a Benchmark Transition Event (an Inability Determination or (ii) any law has made it unlawful, or that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for Lender to make or maintain an advance based on SOFR or SOFR Average, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or SOFR Average (an Illegality Determination ), then Lender will so notify Debtor. 

THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDES THE TERMS ON THE NUMBER OF PAGES IDENTIFIED BELOW 

Debtor: Geneva Pipe and Precast Company 

/s/ Aaron Wilkins 

By 

Aaron Wilkins, Vice President, Secretary, and Chief Financial Officer 

Print Name and Title 

From the date of an Inability Determination or an Illegality Determination until Lender revokes such Inability Determination or notifies Debtor that the circumstances giving rise to such Illegality Determination no longer exist, as applicable, the Adjusted Prime Rate shall replace SOFR Average for any determination of interest hereunder for any affected Interest Period hereunder (with the margin that had been added to SOFR Average added to the Adjusted Prime Rate); provided, however, that no such determination of interest shall take effect during any applicable Interest Period as a result of an Inability Determination. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, if a Benchmark Replacement is subsequently determined in accordance with applicable Benchmark Replacement Provisions, that Benchmark Replacement, plus any applicable margin, will then supersede the foregoing with respect to the replaced Benchmark. Adjusted Prime Rate means, at any time, the amount equal to (a) the Prime Rate as of such time less (b) the amount (which may be a positive or negative number or zero and which amount shall remain the same from the date of an Inability Determination or an Illegality Determination until Lender revokes such Inability Determination or notifies Debtor that the circumstances giving rise to such Illegality Determination no longer exist, as applicable) equal to (i) the Prime Rate as of the date of the last available SOFR Average less (ii) the last available SOFR Average (if such SOFR Average is greater than the Prime Rate, so that (i) minus (ii) results in a negative number, then the negative number shall be added to (a) to arrive at the Adjusted Prime Rate); provided, however, that if Adjusted Prime Rate would be less than the Benchmark Floor, then Adjusted Prime Rate shall be deemed to be the Benchmark Floor. Prime Rate means at any time the rate of interest most recently announced within Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Bank at its principal office as its Prime Rate, with the understanding that the Prime Rate is one of Bank's base rates and serves as the basis upon which effective rates of interest are calculated for those loans making reference thereto, and is evidenced by the recording thereof after its announcement in such internal publication or publications as Bank may designate. If the rate of interest announced by Bank as its Prime Rate at any time is less than the Benchmark Floor, then for purposes of this Note and any related loan document the Prime Rate shall be deemed to be the Benchmark Floor. 

First Installment Due Date means the date that is one month after the date loan proceeds are disbursed hereunder. Debtor agrees that the dates of the First Installment Due Date and the Final Installment Due Date may be left blank when this Note is executed and hereby authorizes Lender to insert such dates based upon a 60-month term and the date the loan proceeds are disbursed. 

First Installment Due Date: 

Final Installment Due Date: 

Debtor promises to pay the principal and interest hereof as follows: 

Principal shall be payable in 59 consecutive monthly installments of 250,000.00 each commencing on the First Installment Due Date and continuing on the same day of each month thereafter, and in a final installment of the entire unpaid balance of this Note on the Final Installment Due Date, when the entire unpaid principal shall become due and payable. 

Interest on the unpaid principal balance through the day preceding the payment due date shall be paid with each principal installment. 

The amount of each installment payment and the annual interest rate used to compute such payments each as set forth above were calculated based on Lender s cost of funds within two Business Days of the date of this Note set forth above. Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary, if the loan proceeds are not disbursed within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date of this Note and Lender s cost of funds has increased subsequent to the date of this Note, the annual interest rate and the amount of the installment payments will be increased to provide the same yield to Lender as would have been obtained if Lender s cost of funds had not increased. The annual interest rate and the amount of the installment payments shall be determined by Lender taking into account its cost of funds two Business Days prior to the date that this Note is funded. Debtor agrees that the loan proceeds shall not be disbursed until Lender has received all documentation and information required by Lender, which may include, without limitation, a delivery and acceptance certificate, evidence of insurance, invoices, landlord waivers and evidence of no adverse liens or security interests on the Equipment. In such event Debtor and Lender shall sign an amendment to this Note reflecting the change in the interest rate and installment payments. 

If any installment due hereunder is not received by Lender within ten (10) days of its due date, Debtor agrees to pay a late fee to Lender equal to the lesser of (i) 5 of the past due installment or (ii) the highest amount allowed by applicable law. Payments thereafter received shall be applied first to delinquent installments and then to current installments. 

This Note may be prepaid in whole at any time by paying to Lender the unpaid principal balance of this Note, together with accrued but unpaid interest and late fees, plus a prepayment premium of 2.00 of the principal amount prepaid if prepaid during months 1 - 30 and 0.00 thereafter. 

This Note shall not be prepaid in part except as a result of a permitted disposition of an item of collateral which secures this Note. The amount of such partial prepayment relative to an item of collateral shall be equal to a principal amount, as reasonably determined in Lender s sole discretion, together with accrued but unpaid interest, plus a prepayment premium calculated in accordance with the preceding paragraph with respect to the principal amount prepaid. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as an authorization by Lender to Debtor to sell or otherwise dispose of an item of collateral which secures this Note. Such sale or disposition of an item of collateral by Debtor shall be made solely in accordance with the terms of the security agreement or other agreement pursuant to which Debtor pledged such item of collateral to Lender. 

Debtor may remit to Lender amounts in excess of an installment that is due hereunder and Lender shall apply such amount to the next maturing installment or installments. Payment of amounts in excess of the installment that is due or installments prior to the due date thereof shall not be treated as a prepayment or result in a change to either the total number of installments or the total sum of all installments payable under this Note. 

Debtor shall pay to Lender immediately upon demand, in addition to any other amounts due or to become due hereunder, any and all (i) withholdings, interest equalization taxes, stamp taxes or other taxes (except income and franchise taxes) imposed by any governmental authority and related in any manner to SOFR or SOFR Average, and (ii) costs, expenses and liabilities arising from or in connection with reserve percentages prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for Eurocurrency Liabilities (as defined in Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended), assessment rates imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or similar requirements or costs imposed by any domestic or foreign governmental authority or resulting from compliance by Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other governmental authority and related in any manner to SOFR or SOFR Average. In determining which of the foregoing are attributable to any SOFR or SOFR Average option available to Debtor hereunder, any reasonable allocation made by Lender among its operations shall be conclusive and binding upon Debtor. 

Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder: (a) failure to pay any installment hereunder within ten (10) days of when due; (b) the occurrence of an event of default as defined in any security agreement or mortgage securing this Note; (c) the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings by or against Debtor or any guarantor of this Note; and (d) an event of default shall occur under any indebtedness Debtor may now or hereafter owe to Lender or any affiliate thereof. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may do any one or more of the following as it may elect: (i) declare the entire unpaid balance of the Note to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon the full principal balance plus the prepayment premium described above, together with accrued but unpaid interest through and including the date of payment in full, shall be and become immediately due and payable. Interest shall be calculated from the date of such Event of Default, both before and after judgment, at a rate equal to the lesser of 12 per annum or the highest rate permitted by law (the Default Rate (ii) exercise any one or more of the rights and remedies available to it under any security agreement or mortgage securing this Note or under any other agreement or by law. In no event shall Debtor s obligations under this Note be secured by any real property unless the document granting an interest in real property specifically references this Note by date and/or contract number. 

Debtor hereby waives presentment, notice of dishonor, and protest. Debtor agrees to pay all costs of collection of this Note, including reasonable attorneys fees. The holder hereof may change the terms of payment of the Note by extension, renewal or otherwise, and release any security for, or party to, this Note and such action shall not release any accommodation maker, endorser, or guarantor from liability on this Note. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the rate of interest, late payment fee, prepayment premium or any other charges or fees due hereunder are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be usurious, then said interest rate, fees and/or charges shall be reduced to the maximum amount permissible under applicable law and any such excess amounts shall be applied towards the reduction of the principal balance of this Note. 

This Note shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to conflicts of law rules. DEBTOR HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTE. 

If Debtor is not an individual, (i) the execution, delivery and performance of this Note has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Debtor and will not violate any provision of Debtor s governing documents; (ii) the person signing on behalf of Debtor is duly authorized; and (iii) this Note constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Debtor. 

If this Note is signed by more than one person as Debtor, then the term Debtor shall refer to each of them separately and to all of them jointly, and each such person shall be liable hereunder individually in full and jointly with the others. 

Lender may in its sole discretion, accept a photocopy, electronically transmitted facsimile, pdf or other reproduction of this Note and/or any document related hereto or thereto (a Counterpart as the binding and effective record of this Note and/or such other document, whether or not an ink signed copy hereof is also received by Lender from Debtor, provided, however, that if Lender accepts a Counterpart as the binding and effective record of this Note or any other document, the Counterpart acknowledged by Lender (either in ink or electronically) shall constitute the record hereof or thereof. Debtor represents to Lender that the signature that appears on the Counterpart that is transmitted by Debtor to Lender in any manner described above is intended by Debtor to authenticate the Counterpart notwithstanding that such signature is electronic, facsimile or a reproduction and Debtor further agrees that a Counterpart of this Note or such other document received by Lender, shall, when acknowledged by Lender (either in ink or electronically), constitute an original document for the purposes of establishing the provisions hereof and thereof and shall be legally admissible under the best evidence rule and binding on and enforceable against Debtor. If Lender accepts a Counterpart of a document as the binding and effective record thereof, only such Counterpart acknowledged by Lender s ink or electronic signature may be marked Original and perfection of a security interest by possession or control may only be accomplished by possession or control of the Counterpart that bears Lender s acknowledgement. 

Benchmark Replacement Provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: 

(a) Benchmark Replacement. If a Benchmark Transition Event occurs, the applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then- current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder on the Benchmark Replacement Date without any further action or consent of Debtor. 

(b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. Lender will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of Debtor. 

(c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. Lender will promptly notify Debtor of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by Lender pursuant to these provisions, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and will be made in its sole discretion and without Debtor consent. 

(d) Certain Defined Terms. As used herein: 

Benchmark means, initially, the SOFR Average; provided, however, that if a Benchmark Transition Event has occurred with respect to the SOFR Average or the then-current Benchmark, then Benchmark means the applicable Benchmark Replacement to the extent that such Benchmark Replacement has become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Note. 

Benchmark Administrator means, initially, the SOFR Administrator or any successor administrator of the then-current Benchmark or any insolvency or resolution official with authority over such administrator. 

Benchmark Replacement means the sum of: (x) the alternate rate of interest that has been selected by Lender as the replacement for the then-current Benchmark and (y) the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected by Lender, in each case giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation by the Relevant Governmental Body at such time for a replacement rate, the mechanism for determining such a rate, the methodology or conventions applicable to such rate, or the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for such rate or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest as a replacement to the then-current Benchmark, the methodology or conventions applicable to such rate, or the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for such rate for U.S. dollar-denominated syndicated or bilateral credit facilities; provided, however, that if the Benchmark Replacement as determined as provided would be less than the Benchmark Floor, then the Benchmark Replacement shall be deemed to be the Benchmark Floor for the purposes hereof. 

Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes means any technical, administrative or operational changes (including, without limitation, changes to the timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest, prepayment provisions and other technical, administrative or operational matters) that Lender decides may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of such Benchmark Replacement and to permit the administration thereof by Lender. 

Benchmark Replacement Date means the date specified by Lender in a notice to Debtor following a Benchmark Transition Event. 

Benchmark Transition Event means the occurrence of one or more of the following events with respect to the then-current Benchmark: a public statement or publication of information by or on behalf of the Benchmark Administrator or a regulatory supervisor for the Benchmark Administrator announcing that (a) the Benchmark Administrator has ceased or will cease to provide the Benchmark, permanently or indefinitely; or (b) the Benchmark is not, or as of a specified future date will not be, representative. 

Relevant Governmental Body means the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and/or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or a committee officially endorsed or convened by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and/or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or any successor thereto.
