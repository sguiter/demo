redeemable warrants issued to the public in the Initial
Public Offering (the Public Warrants remain outstanding. 

Prior

shares of Class A common stock, par value per share, issued and outstanding and held by public shareholders (the Public
Shares and shares of Class B common stock, par value per share, issued and outstanding and held by the Sponsor

in shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the Company Common Stock ). 

Prior to the Business Combination,
Legacy Spectral s shares of common stock, par value per share Legacy Spectral Common Stock were listed on
the AIM market on the London Stock Exchange (delisted on September 7, 2023). In September 2023,
prior to the Closing, Legacy Spectral issued shares of Legacy Spectral Common Stock to certain investors in a private
placement, in exchange for million (the Equity Raise ). Upon the Closing, a ll
of Legacy Spectral s issued and outstanding shares of Legacy Spectral Common Stock, including the shares from
the Equity Raise, were exchanged for shares of Company Common Stock at an exchange ratio of (the Exchange
Ratio ), meaning that the Company issued one share of Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of Legacy Spectral Common
Stock. 

On

Nature of Operations 

We
are an artificial intelligence AI company focused on predictive medical diagnostics. Our DeepView System uses proprietary
AI algorithms to distinguish between fully damaged, partially damaged and healthy human tissue characters invisible to the naked eye,
at the initial time point of wound presentation. The DeepView System delivers a binary prediction on the wounds capacity to heal by a
specified time point in the future. Our DeepView System s output is specifically engineered to assist the physician in making a
more accurate, timely and informed decision regarding the treatment of the patient s wounds. Our focus from 2013 through 2021 was
on the burn indication. In 2022, we expanded our focus to include the diabetic foot ulcer DFU indication. 

5 

million (the PBS BARDA Contract ).
This multi-year contract includes an initial award of nearly million to support the clinical validation and FDA clearance of DeepView for
commercial development and distribution purposes. The Company completed the second contract with BARDA, referred to as BARDA Burn II,
which was signed in July 2019 and completed in November 2023. Under this contract, the Company furthered the DeepView System design,
developed the AI algorithm, and took steps to obtain FDA approval. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has million remaining to
bill under the initial award. 

In April 2023, the Company received
a million grant from MTEC for a project that is expected to be completed by April 2025 (the MTEC Agreement ). The
MTEC Agreement is for the development of a handheld version of the DeepView System which is to be used to support military battlefield
burn evaluation . The project has three phases, beginning with planning, design and testing; followed
by development, design modification and buildout of the handheld device; and then the manufacturing of the handheld device. In August
2024, the MTEC award was increased to million and is currently intended to run through December 2025 with funding dependent on various
milestones. In September 2024, we received an additional award of million from MTEC for further development of the handheld device.
In March 2024, we received an additional million award from the Defense Health Agency to further this development. As of September
30, 2024, the Company has million and million remaining to bill under the MTEC and DHA awards, respectively. 

On March 7, 2024, the Company
formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Spectral IP, Inc., a Delaware corporation Spectral IP ), to be utilized to advance
artificial intelligence intellectual property with a specific emphasis on healthcare. On March 19, 2024, the Company announced that Spectral
IP received a million investment from an affiliate of its largest shareholder for the development of its artificial intelligence
intellectual property portfolio. The investment is structured as a note payable with a one-year maturity, an interest rate of , and
requiring earlier prepayment if the Company spins off Spectral IP to the Company s shareholders or if Spectral IP is sold to a third
party. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

The Company is subject to
a number of risks common to development stage companies in the medical technology industry, including, but not limited to, risks of failure
of preclinical studies and clinical trials, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, reliance on third party
organizations, risks of obtaining regulatory approval for any products that it may develop, development by competitors of technological
innovations, compliance with government regulations and the need to obtain additional financing. 

Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately
 million and million, respectively, in cash, and an accumulated deficit of million and million, respectively. As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately million and million, respectively, in short-term
notes payable and million in long-term debt as of September 30, 2024. See Notes 7 and 15 for further information. 

On
December 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement and related Registration
Rights Agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC B. Riley ). Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, in our sole discretion, to sell to B. Riley up to million
in aggregate gross proceeds of newly issued shares of the Company s Common Stock (the ELOC ). 

6 

million
in shares of Company Common Stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA (such transaction, the Yorkville
Transaction ). In connection with the SEPA, and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Yorkville has agreed to advance to
the Company in the form of convertible promissory notes an aggregate principal amount of up to million (the Pre-Paid Advance ),
which will be paid in three tranches. The first Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on March 20, 2024 in the amount of million and the
second Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on May 16, 2024 in the amount of million. The third Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on July
17, 2024 in the principal amount of million. In addition to the Pre-Paid Advance, the Company has the ability to drawdown an additional
 million under the SEPA. In connection with the execution and delivery of the SEPA, the Company is authorized to drawdown an additional
 million from the ELOC prior to utilizing the SEPA. See Note 7 and Note 10 for further details. 

On
June 3, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq that the Company was not in compliance with the listing requirement relating to a minimum market value of its listed securities of 
million. The Company has 180 calendar days from receipt of a notice from Nasdaq to regain compliance with the market value of listed securities
requirement. If at any time before December 2, 2024, the closing market capitalization of the Company s Common Stock closes at or
above million for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, subject to Nasdaq s discretion to extend this period to 20 consecutive
business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance with the minimum market capitalization
requirement, and the matter would be resolved. If the Company does not regain compliance during the review period ending December 2, 2024,
the Company may be delisted from Nasdaq. See Part II below for further information. 

Based on our current operating
plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, together with the PBS BARDA Contract, the MTEC Agreement, the B. Riley ELOC, and
the Yorkville Transaction, and certain research and development cost-saving measures, will be sufficient to fund operations for at least
one year beyond the release date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. We have based this determination on assumptions
that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The Company could utilize
cost-savings measures to limit the expenditures of our DFU indication to conserve our working capital and to focus our efforts primarily
on the burn indication. Changing circumstances could also cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate,
and we may need to raise capital sooner or in greater amounts than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. Changes
in the current equity markets may also limit our ability to utilize the B. Riley ELOC and Yorkville Transaction as currently structured.
To the extent additional capital is necessary, there are no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital on favorable
terms or at all, and therefore we may not be able to execute our business plans and the continued work on indications beyond expanding
our burn indication.

Warrants in that the Company can redeem some or all of the Public Warrants for per Public Warrant based on certain market conditions

Fair values of cash, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term debt (other than the notes payable with Yorkville) are carried at cost,
which management believes approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of the Public Warrants,
which trade in active markets, is based on quoted market prices and classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The SP Angel Warrants
are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair values are based on significant inputs that are unobservable
in the market.

The
Company elected the fair value option to account for the financial instrument with Yorkville signed on March 20, 2024 (see Note 7). The
estimate of the fair value as of September 30, 2024 was determined using a binomial lattice model. The fair value measurement of the debt
is determined using Level 3 inputs and assumptions unobservable in the market.

Advances in the amount of million, of which million was settled in cash and million was settled in shares. Of the
aggregate installment payments, million relates to the repayment of the principal, million relates to the original
issue discount and million relates to the payment premium. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate outstanding principal
balance of the Yorkville Convertible Notes is million. 

As the SEPA is an
equity-linked contract that does not qualify for equity classification, any expenses incurred will be recognized in the consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive loss within borrowing related costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
recognized million and million in issuance costs related to the SEPA. 

Related Party Note

Spectral AI RSUs, based on the Exchange Ratio. 

2018 Long Term Incentive Plan 

On July 24, 2018, Legacy
Spectral s Board of Directors adopted the 2018 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan which permitted granting of
incentive stock options (which must meet all statutory requirements), non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, stock units, performance shares, performance units, incentive bonus awards, and other cash-based or stock-based awards. In May
2024, all awards outstanding under the 2018 Plan were replaced with corresponding awards to be issued pursuant to the 2023 Plan, as discussed
below, and no new grants will be made under the 2018 Plan. 

2022 Long Term Incentive Plan 

On September 27, 2022, Legacy
Spectral s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2022 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan which permitted
granting of incentive stock options (they must meet all statutory requirements), non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, stock units, performance shares, performance units, incentive bonus awards, and other cash-based or stock-based awards.
In May 2024, all awards outstanding under the 2022 Plan were replaced with corresponding awards to be issued pursuant to the 2023 Plan,
as discussed below, and no new grants will be made under the 2022 Plan.

, plus the number of shares that are automatically added on January 1st of each year for a period of up to ten years,
commencing on January 1, 2024 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2033, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) five percent of the total number of shares of stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, and (ii) an amount determined by the
Board of Directors. Pursuant to the 2023 Plan, stock options must expire within 10 years and must be granted with exercise prices
of no less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant date, as determined by the Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2024,
under the 2023 Plan, shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and restricted stock
units RSUs were issuable. Under the 2023 Plan, shares remain available for issuance through grants of future
options. RSUs awarded under the 2023 Plan for the purchase of common stock will vest based on continued service which is generally three
years or based on the achievement of market terms as set forth in the individual awards. The grant date fair value of the award will be
recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of the RSUs is estimated on the date of grant based
on the fair value of the Company s common stock. The 2023 Plan provides that the Compensation Committee shall determine the vesting
conditions of awards granted under the 2023 Plan, and the Compensation Committee has from time-to-time approved vesting schedules for
certain awards that deviate from the vesting conditions described in the previous sentence. 

Restricted Stock Units 

On January 3, 2024, pursuant
to the 2022 Plan, the Company granted its then-CFO a market condition RSU of up to shares of the Company s common stock.
The award had a grant date fair value of approximately million using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The RSUs under this market-based
award will vest partially based on achievement of stock price targets of the Company s common stock. RSUs vest when the 180-day
VWAP meets or exceeds per share, RSUs vest when the 180-day VWAP meets or exceeds per share, and RSUs are not
market-based and will vest over the continued service period of three years. These market-based conditions must be met in order for portions
of the RSU award to vest, and it is therefore possible that certain awards ultimately would not vest. The grant date fair value of each
RSU grant is expensed over the requisite service period. Compensation expense relating to share-based awards with market-based conditions
is not reversed if these awards are forfeited based solely on failing to meet such market-based conditions. 

On February 29, 2024, pursuant
to the 2022 Plan, the Company granted both its CFO and CEO awards of RSUs up to shares of the Company s common stock. The
awards had a grant date fair value of approximately million using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The portion of RSUs that are market-based
awards will vest partially based on achievement of stock price targets of the Company s common stock. RSUs vest when the
180-day VWAP meets or exceeds per share, RSUs vest when the 180-day VWAP meets or exceeds per share. The market-based
conditions must be met in order for the market-based portion of the RSU awards to vest, and it is therefore possible that certain awards
ultimately would not vest. RSUs are not market-based and will vest over the continued service period of three years. The grant
date fair value of each RSU grant is expensed over the requisite service period. Compensation expense relating to share-based awards with
market-based conditions is not reversed if these awards are forfeited based solely on failing to meet such market-based conditions. 

On February 29, 2024, the
Company amended the terms of the January 3, 2024 RSU grant to its then-CFO to provide for identical vesting terms to those provided in
the February 29, 2024 RSU grant. The Company determined the amended RSU grant represents a modification of the original award, however,
the incremental compensation cost of the amendment was not material.

date fair value of per share and per share, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation expense
related to restricted stock units was million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. 

Stock Options 

The fair value of each employee
and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Legacy Spectral s
stock became publicly traded on July 22, 2021 on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange, and lacks company-specific historical and
implied volatility information. On September 11, 2023 the Company completed the Business Combination and was listed on NASDAQ under the
symbol MDAI. Legacy Spectral estimated its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer
companies. Spectral AI continues to estimate its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set
of peer companies. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected term of Legacy Spectral s and Spectral AI s
stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the simplified method by taking an average of the vesting periods and the original
contractual terms for each award. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the
option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the US. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of
the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the
fact that Legacy Spectral and Spectral AI have never paid cash dividends and Spectral AI does not expect to pay any cash dividends in
the foreseeable future. 

The Company s stock
options generally vest ratably annually over years and have a contractual term of years.

stock for those stock options that had exercise prices lower than the fair value of the common stock as of the respective date. 

As of September 30, 2024,
there was approximately million of unrecognized stock-based compensation related to stock option grants that will be amortized
over a weighted average period of 0.9 years. 

The Company recorded stock-based

of Directors outside of the 2018 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Investor Options were exercised and the
remaining Investor Options expired in November 2023. The Investor Options had an exercise price of per share.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

You should read the following
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis
or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the
section titled Risk Factors, in our 2023 Annual Report and in other reports we have filed or may file with the SEC, our
actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following
discussion and analysis. 

Overview 

We are an artificial intelligence AI company focused on predictive medical diagnostics. We operate in one segment. Currently, we are devoting substantially
all of our efforts towards research and development of our DeepView System, an internally developed multi-spectral imaging
device that has previously received FDA breakthrough device designation status for an earlier version. Given our recent receipt of the
UKCA mark for burn indication on our DeepView System, we expect to begin commercialization activities in the United Kingdom
in the second half of 2024. Our DeepView System uses proprietary algorithms to distinguish between damaged and healthy
human tissue invisible to the naked eye, providing Day One healing assessments. DeepView s output is specifically
engineered to allow the physician to make a more accurate, timely and informed decision regarding the treatment of the patient s
wound. Our focus from 2013 through 2021 was on the burn indication, which we expanded to also include the diabetic foot ulcer DFU indication in 2022. 

For burn wounds, a non-healing assessment
could aid the clinician in making an immediate and objective determination for appropriate candidates for surgery, as well as determining
what specific areas of the burn wound will require excision and skin grafting. We have conducted three large clinical studies with
multiple sites across the United States, enrolling 413 burn patients, including 329 adult and 84 pediatric patients. Through these studies,
we were able to quantify the burn assessment accuracy in patients undergoing both surgical and non-surgical treatment. In December
2023 we initiated a pivotal clinical study seeking enrollment of 240 patients, including 180 adult and 60 pediatric patients through multiple
sites across the United States in both burn center and emergency departments. By the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company had
completed the enrollment of 169 patients at burn centers, finishing that portion of the overall study. 

In the case of DFUs,
our DeepView System provides an assessment in seconds as to the non-healing portions of a DFU. The non-healing assessment could
provide the physician with an objective assessment to use an advanced wound care therapy on Day One as opposed to the current
approach that involves waiting up to 30 days to see how the wound develops before making such clinical assessment. 

We have not generated any
product revenue to date. We have received substantial support from the U.S. government for our DeepView System s application
for burn wounds, particularly from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA ,
which is part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in the United States, established to aid
in securing the United States from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, as well as from pandemic influenza and
emerging infectious diseases. We have also received funding from the National Science Foundation (the NSF ), the National
Institute of Health (the NIH and the Defense Health Agency (the DHA ). Since 2013, we have received approximately
 281.0 million in funding awards from government contracts, primarily from BARDA, which accounts for 272.9 million. This has allowed
us to develop our technology and further our clinical trials. 

In September 2023, we executed
our third contract with BARDA for a multi-year Project BioShield PBS agreement, valued at up to approximately 150.0 million
(the PBS BARDA Contract ). This multi-year contract includes an initial award of nearly 54.9 million to support the clinical
validation and FDA clearance of DeepView for commercial marketing and distribution purposes, which we expect to continue through
the first quarter of 2026. This contract funding is non-dilutive to our shareholders, and we believe it validates the important nature
of our mission and technology. 

In addition to our PBS BARDA
Contract, we received a 4.0 million grant award from the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium MTEC in April
2023, which, building on prior awards from DHA, is to be used to support military battlefield burn evaluation via a handheld version of
the DeepView System (the MTEC Agreement ). In August 2024, the MTEC award was increased to 4.9 million and
is currently intended to run through December 2025 with funding dependent on various milestones. In September 2024, we received an additional
 0.9 million from MTEC for further development of the handheld device. In March 2024, we received an additional 0.5 million award from
the Defense Health Agency to further this development. 

Once commercialized, we anticipate
that the DeepView System will have two revenue streams, a SaMD (software as a medical device) model, and an imaging device
component. The SaMD model applies a SaaS (software as a service) treatment for the DeepView System which will feature
a software licensing fee that includes maintenance, image hosting, and access to algorithm updates. The proprietary imaging device accesses
artificial intelligence algorithms and is a universal platform to house multiple clinical applications. Pricing for these components will
be evaluated and strategically set per country and site-of-service for heightened customer adoption.

Business Combination 

On September 11, 2023, we
consummated a business combination, pursuant to the business combination agreement dated April 11,
2023 by and among the Company (previously, Rosecliff Acquisition Corp I Rosecliff )), Ghost Merger Sub I (a wholly owned
subsidiary of Rosecliff), Ghost Merger Sub II (a wholly owned subsidiary of Rosecliff) and Spectral MD Holdings, Ltd. Legacy Spectral ).
Upon the closing of the Business Combination (the Closing ), in sequential order: (a) Ghost Merger Sub I merged with and
into Legacy Spectral, with Legacy Spectral continuing as the surviving company as our wholly owned subsidiary (the Spectral Merger and then, (b) Legacy Spectral merged with and into Ghost Merger Sub II (the SPAC Merger , together with the Spectral Merger
(the Business Combination )), with Ghost Merger Sub II (renamed Spectral MD Holdings LLC) surviving the SPAC Merger as our
direct wholly-owned subsidiary. Upon the Closing, we changed our name from Rosecliff Acquisition Corp I to Spectral AI, Inc . 
In addition to our Common Stock, we currently have 8,433,333 redeemable warrants (the Public Warrants and 73,978 warrants SP Angel Warrants to SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP remaining outstanding. 

On
September 12, 2023, the Company began trading its shares of the Company Common Stock and the Public Warrants on the Nasdaq Global Market
(the Nasdaq under the symbols MDAI and MDAIW , respectively. 

The Business Combination
was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP. Under the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805, Business Combinations, Rosecliff, which is the legal acquirer, has been treated as the acquired company for
financial reporting purposes and the Company has been treated as the accounting acquirer. This determination was primarily based on the
following: 

(i) 
 Legacy Spectral s former shareholders maintained a majority of the voting power of the Company; 

(ii) 
 Legacy Spectral s senior management comprises all of the senior management of the Company; 

(iii) 
 Legacy Spectral selected five of the six of the directors for the Board of Directors of the Company; 

(iv) 
 Legacy Spectral s relative size of assets and operations compared to Rosecliff; and 

(v) 
 Legacy Spectral s operations comprised the ongoing operations of the Company. 

Accordingly, for accounting
purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of a capital transaction in which Legacy Spectral issued stock for the
net assets of Rosecliff prior to the Closing. Upon the Closing, the net assets of Rosecliff are stated at fair value, with no goodwill
or other intangible assets recorded. All historical financial information presented in the consolidated
financial statements represents the accounts of Legacy Spectral at their historical cost as if Legacy Spectral is the predecessor to the
Company. Upon consummation of the Business Combination, Spectral AI has continued as an SEC-registered and Nasdaq-listed company.
 The consolidated financial statements following the Closing reflect the results of the Combined
Company s operations. 

Key Operating and Financial Metrics 

We regularly review a number
of metrics, including the following key operating and financial metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends
in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe the operating and financial metrics presented
are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are similar to measures by our public competitors and are regularly used by
security analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA
is a non-GAAP measure, as it is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute
for net (loss) income, calculated in accordance with GAAP. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information
on adopted non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.

Research and Development Revenue 

We define research and development
revenue as revenue generated from the research, testing and development of our DeepView System as utilized in connection with our
burn indication. This research and development revenue reflects applied research and experimental development costs relating to our burn
application as developed in connection with our BARDA, MTEC, and DHA contracts. 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

We define gross profit as
research and development revenue, less cost of revenue, and define gross margin, expressed as a percentage, as the ratio of gross profit
to revenue. Gross profit and gross margin can be used to understand our financial performance and efficiency and as we begin commercialization,
it will allow investors to evaluate our pricing strategy and compare against our competitors. Our management uses these metrics to make
strategic decisions, pricing decisions, identify areas for improvement, set targets for future performance and make informed decisions
about how to allocate resources going forward. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

We define adjusted earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding income taxes, depreciation of
property and equipment, net interest income, stock compensation, transaction costs and any non-operating financial income and expense.
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA. 

Key Factors that May Influence Future Results
of Operations 

Our financial results of
operations may not be comparable from period to period due to several factors. Key factors affecting our results of operations are summarized
below. 

Revenue Sources. As
a pre-commercialization company, we currently generate revenue almost exclusively from two U.S. governmental agencies. We are
highly dependent upon the continuation of the existing U.S. governmental contract awards, as well as future governmental procurement
or other awards. Our operating results may not be comparable between periods as the timing and amount of awards or procurements from the
U.S. government may be inconsistent with the timing of prior awards and the phasing of the development study schedules may be different.
Our revenues may continue to be almost exclusively dependent upon the terms of those awards. 

Gross Margin. When
we begin commercial sales of the DeepView System , we may need to determine lower pricing and incentives to accelerate adoption and
implementation of the DeepView System , which may negatively impact future revenue and gross margin percentages. 

28 

Managing our Supply Chain. We
are reliant on contract manufacturers and suppliers to produce our components. While we have not been subject to any disruptions in our
current limited production, we may be subject to component shortages, which may cause delays in critical components and inventory, longer
lead times, increased costs and delays in product shipments. Our ability to grow depends, in part, on the ability of our contract manufacturers
and suppliers to provide high quality services and deliver components and finished products on time and at reasonable costs. While we
do not maintain sole-source suppliers, there is a concentration of suppliers which could lead to supply shortages, long lead times
for components and supply changes. In the event we are unable to mitigate the impact of delays and/or price increases in raw materials,
electronic components and freight, it could delay the manufacturing and installation of our products, which would adversely impact our
cash flows and results of operations, including revenue and gross margin. 

Components of Consolidated Statements of
Operations 

Research and Development Revenue 

Our
primary source of revenue is research and development revenue. Currently, we are highly dependent upon the reimbursements from BARDA for
the burn diagnostic testing of our DeepView System. Our research and development revenue is affected by the amount of research and
development that is expended each month with respect to our PBS BARDA Contract and other U.S. governmental contract awards. During
2023, we received a grant under the MTEC Agreement, which we earn based on the achievement of milestones. Our revenue growth is dependent
on a number of factors including expanding the research and development expense under the PBS BARDA Contract, research and development
reimbursed expenses relating to other contract awards from U.S. governmental agencies and the intended future commercial sales of
our DeepView System. 

Cost of Revenue 

Our
cost of revenue consists primarily of direct and indirect costs associated with the research and development expenses relating to the
PBS BARDA Contract and MTEC Agreement. Our cost of revenue is affected by the extent of research and development expenses as well as expansion
of work on other U.S. governmental projects and the expanded applications for our DeepView System. 

Gross Profit 

Gross
profit may vary from period-to-period and is primarily affected by the current reimbursement rates under the PBS BARDA Contract and
other U.S. governmental contract awards, as well as the percentage of revenue related to the PBS BARDA Contract as compared to the
MTEC project. These reimbursement rates are fixed under each contact award. Our gross profit represents this reimbursement rate plus a
variable component relating to non-reimbursed expenses incurred in connection with the work completed on these contracts. 

Operating Costs and Expenses 

Operating
costs and expenses consist of general and administrative expense. These expenses primarily relate to salaries and related costs of our
organization s support and operations staff, consulting fees, rent, insurance and office expenses, and our non-revenue generating
research and development expenses, primarily related to salaries and related costs and consulting fees. 

Other income (expense) 

In
2024, other income (expense) consists of fees incurred in connection with the Yorkville transaction and B. Riley purchase agreement, net
interest income, borrowing related costs related to the Yorkville convertible notes, change in fair value of notes payable, change in
fair value of warrant liabilities, changes in fair value of derivatives, and foreign exchange transaction gains/losses. In 2023, other
income (expense) consists of transaction costs related to the Business Combination, net interest income, change in fair value of warrant
liabilities and foreign exchange transaction gain/losses. Historic foreign exchange transaction loss primarily relates to changes in the
exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling for our deposit accounts that are denominated in British pound
sterling. In addition, this amount includes costs associated with buying British pound sterling for payment of our employees and vendors
in the UK.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We use Adjusted EBITDA as
a non-GAAP metric when measuring performance, including when measuring current period results against prior periods Adjusted EBITDA. This
non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as
a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indicator of our operating
performance, liquidity or cash flows generated by operating, investing and financing activities, as there may be significant factors or
trends that it fails to address. 

Because of their non-standardized
definitions, non-GAAP measures (unlike GAAP measures) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies.
We caution investors that non-GAAP financial information, by its nature, departs from traditional accounting conventions. Supplemental
non-GAAP measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how Spectral AI s management assesses underlying
performance. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

We define Adjusted EBITDA
as net loss excluding income taxes, depreciation of property and equipment, net interest income, stock compensation, transaction costs
and any non-operating financial income and expense.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 3.7 million in cash,
short-term notes payable of 5.0 million, and 1.0 million of long-term debt. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately 40.3 million.
Included in our cash balance is 0.9 million in cash in the Company s newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary Spectral IP, Inc., a
Delaware corporation Spectral IP which was formed on March 7, 2024. See Notes 7 and 15 for further information. 

On December 26, 2023, we
entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement and related Registration Rights Agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC B.
Riley ). Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the
Company has the right, in our sole discretion, to sell to B. Riley up to 10.0 million in aggregate gross purchase price of newly issued
shares of the Company s Common Stock (the ELOC ). 

On March 20, 2024, the Company
also entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement SEPA with YA II PN, LTD, a Cayman Islands exempt limited partnership Yorkville pursuant to which the Company has the right to sell to Yorkville up to 30.0 million of its shares of Common
Stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA. In connection with the SEPA, and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, Yorkville has agreed to advance to the Company in the form of convertible promissory notes an aggregate principal amount
of up to 12.5 million (the Pre-Paid Advance ), which will be paid in three tranches. The first Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed
on March 20, 2024 in the amount of 5.0 million with a fixed conversion price of 3.16. The Company received 4.6 million in cash, net
of the 8 original issue discount. On May 14, 2024, the shareholders voted to approve the reservation and issuance of shares to Yorkville
to exceed the Exchange Cap and the second Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on May 16, 2024 in the amount of 4.6 million, which is the 5.0
million second Pre-Paid Advance net of 0.4 million of the 8 original issue discount, with a fixed conversion price of 2.03. The third
Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on July 17, 2024 in the principal amount of 2.5 million. In connection with the execution and delivery
of the SEPA, the Company may also drawdown 3.0 million from the ELOC prior to utilizing the SEPA. 

We
have historically funded our operations through the issuance of notes and the sale of preferred stock and common stock, along with payments
under governmental contracts for research and development activity. 

33 

In September 2023, the Company
executed its third contract with BARDA for a multi-year PBS BARDA Contract, valued at up to approximately 150.0 million. This multi-year
contract includes an initial award of nearly 54.9 million to support the clinical validation and FDA clearance of DeepView for
commercial development and distribution purposes. The Company completed the second contract with BARDA, referred to as BARDA Burn II,
which was signed in July 2019 and completed in November 2023. Under this contract, the Company furthered the DeepView System
design, developed the AI algorithm, and took steps to obtain FDA approval. 

In
April 2023, the Company received a 4.0 million grant under the MTEC Agreement, which was increased to 4.9 million in August
2024 and is currently intended to run through December 2025. The MTEC Agreement is for the development
of a handheld version of the DeepView System which is to be used to support military battlefield burn evaluation .
The project has three phases, beginning with planning, design and testing; followed by development, design modification and buildout of
the handheld device; and then the manufacturing of the handheld device. 

Based on our current operating
plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, together with the PBS BARDA Contract, the MTEC Agreement, the B. Riley ELOC, and
the Yorkville Transaction, will be sufficient to fund operations for at least one year beyond the release date of these condensed consolidated
financial statements. We have based this determination on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect. The Company could utilize cost-savings measures to limit the expenditures of our DFU indication
to conserve our working capital and to focus our efforts primarily on the burn indication. Changing circumstances could also cause us
to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to raise capital sooner or in greater amounts than
currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. Changes in the current equity markets may also limit our ability to utilize
the B. Riley ELOC and Yorkville Transaction as currently structured. To the extent additional capital is necessary, there are no assurances
that we will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all, and therefore we may not be able to execute our business
plans and the continued work on indications beyond expanding our burn indication. 

Our future capital requirements
will depend on many factors, including the revenue growth rate, the success of future product development and capital investment required,
and the timing and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts. In addition, we expect
to incur additional costs as a result of operating as a U.S. public company. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired,
our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

Cash Flows 

The
following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Nine months ended September 30,

 (9,668 
 (10,865 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities

 4,039 

Cash Flows Used in
Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities increased by approximately 1.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by changes in operating
liabilities including accrued expenses and deferred revenue, partially offset by a decrease in net loss. The lower net loss is a result
of higher research and development revenue due to increased BARDA activity and lower non-operating transaction costs in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

34 

Cash Flows Provided
by Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities increased approximately 4.5 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily attributable to
the proceeds of 2.7 million from the ELOC, proceeds of 12.5 received from notes payable principally from the Pre-Paid Advances under
the SEPA, partially offset by 6.6 million of repayments of notes payable as compared to proceeds of 3.4 million from the issuance of
Common Stock and operating cash received upon closing of the Business Combination of 0.7 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Current Indebtedness 

On March 20, 2024, the Company
entered into the SEPA with Yorkville pursuant to which the Company has the right to sell to Yorkville up to 30.0 million of its shares
of Company Common Stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA, from time to time during the term of the
SEPA (such transaction, the Yorkville Transaction ). In connection with the SEPA, and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, Yorkville has agreed to advance to the Company in the form of convertible promissory notes (the Convertible Notes an aggregate principal amount of up to 12.5 million (the Pre-Paid Advance ), which will be paid in three tranches. The first
Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on March 20, 2024 in the amount of 5.0 million with a fixed conversion price of 3.16. The Company received
 4.6 million in cash, net of the 8 original issue discount. On May 14, 2024, the shareholders voted to approve the reservation and issuance
of shares to Yorkville to exceed the Exchange Cap and the second Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on May 16, 2024 in the amount of 4.6
million, which is the 5.0 million second Pre-Paid Advance net of 0.4 million of the 8 original issue discount, with a fixed conversion
price of 2.03. The third Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on July 17, 2024 in the principal amount of 2.5 million with a fixed conversion
price equal to 120 of the average VWAP during the three trading days immediately prior to the issuance of the note. The purchase price
for the Pre-Paid Advance is 92.0 of the principal amount of the Pre-Paid Advance. Interest shall accrue on the outstanding balance of
any Pre-Paid Advance at an annual rate equal to 0 , subject to an increase to 18 upon an event of default as described in the Convertible
Notes. 

Beginning on the forty-fifth
(45th) day following the issuance date of the Convertible Note issued in connection with the first Pre-Paid Advance, and continuing on
the same day of each successive month thereafter, (each, an Installment Date ), the Company shall repay a portion of the
outstanding balance of the Pre-Paid Advance in an amount equal to (i) 1,750,000, plus (ii) the a payment premium of 7 of such Installment
Principal Amount, and (iii) accrued and unpaid interest hereunder as of each Installment Date. The maturity date of the Convertible Notes
issue in connection with each Pre-Paid Advance will be 12 months after the issuance date of such Convertible Notes. In October 2024, the
Company and Yorkville agreed to amend the dates and the allocation of installment amounts to be paid pursuant to the Pre-Paid Advances,
such that the outstanding balance of the Pre-Paid Advances is to be paid by February 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has made
aggregate installment payments on the Pre-Paid Advances in the amount of 8.3 million, of which 7.2 million was settled in cash and 2.1
million was settled in shares. Of the aggregate installment payments, 7.1 million relates to the repayment of the principal, 0.6 million
relates to the 8 original issue discount and 0.6 million relates to the 7 payment premium. 

Related Party Transactions 

On March 7, 2024, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary,
Spectral IP, to be utilized to acquire artificial intelligent intellectual property with a specific emphasis on healthcare. On March 19,
2024, the Company announced that Spectral IP received a 1.0 million investment from an affiliate of its largest shareholder for the development
of its artificial intelligence intellectual property portfolio. The investment is structured as a note payable with a one-year maturity,
an interest rate of 8 , and requiring earlier prepayment if the Company spins off Spectral IP to the Company s shareholders or if
Spectral IP is sold to a third party. See Note 15 for further information. 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements 

During
the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Critical Accounting
Policies 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation
of these condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial
statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates which include, but are not limited to, accrued expenses,
stock-based compensation expense, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various
other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our
critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. 

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements 

See
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards as of the dates of the statement
of financial position included in this Form 10-Q. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of
an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company
to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to
use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act for the adoption of certain accounting standards until the earlier of the date we
(i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period
provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply more promptly with new
or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

In
addition, as an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise
applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

being permitted to present only two years of audited consolidated financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, with correspondingly reduced disclosure in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

an exception from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; 

reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; 

exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 

We
may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the Company s
initial public offering or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We will cease to qualify as an emerging
growth company on the date that is the earliest of: (i) December 31, 2026; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more
than 1.235 billion in total annual gross revenues; (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer 
under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as
of the prior September 30th and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one annual report on Form 10-K; or
(iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over the prior three-year period. We may choose to
take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different
than you might obtain from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. 

36 

We are also a smaller
reporting company. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue
to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller
reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited consolidated financial statements in our
Annual Report and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate, foreign exchange, credit
and inflation risks. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 

We
maintain a large amount of our assets in cash. Our cash is held primarily in cash deposits. The fair value of our cash would not be significantly
affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short-term nature of these instruments. Additionally, changes
to interest rates will impact on the cost of any future borrowings. With respect to our current borrowings, the interest rates on the
notes are fixed. Changes in prevailing interest rates could have a material impact on our results of operations. 

Foreign Currency
Risk 

Our
revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located,
which is primarily in the United States and UK, with an insignificant portion of expenses incurred in our wholly owned subsidiaries
in the UK and denominated in British pound sterling. 

Credit Risk 

Financial
instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The vast majority of our
cash is held in U.S. financial institutions which, at times, exceed federally insured limits. We have not recognized any losses from
credit risks on such accounts. We believe we are not exposed to significant credit risk on cash. 

Additional
credit risk is related to our concentration of receivables and revenues. One customer (which is a U.S. government agency) represents
the majority of our research and development revenue and accounts receivable. 

Inflation Risk 

The
recent increase in inflation partially contributed to the increase in the cost of our research and development as well as operating costs.
If the cost of our products, employee costs, or other costs continue to be subject to significant inflationary pressures, such inflationary
pressure may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative
expense. As a result, our inability to quickly respond to inflation could harm our cash flows and results of operations in the future. 

37 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, including
our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on management s evaluation as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting as described below and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September
30, 2024. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified
material weaknesses in: (i) lack of communication within management and internal departments regarding complex and unusual arrangements.
This resulted in communication failures of relevant facts necessary for the accounting group to properly conclude and apply the required
accounting treatment of certain stock transactions; (ii) the Company did not maintain adequately designed controls to ensure the proper
recording of operating expenses, related accruals and unbilled revenue in the correct period. As a result, certain control activities
in the accrual and unbilled revenue processes were not designed and implemented effectively; and (iii) our financial statement close process
controls which relate to all financial statement accounts, did not consistently operate effectively or lacked appropriate evidence, to
ensure account reconciliations, transactions, and journal entries were performed or reviewed at the appropriate level of precision and
on a timely basis. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that would not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis, and accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies in aggregate constitute a material
weakness. 

Notwithstanding the identified
material weaknesses, our management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses 

Remediation generally requires
making changes to how controls are designed and implemented and then adhering to those changes for a sufficient period of time such that
the effectiveness of those changes is demonstrated with an appropriate amount of consistency. In response to the material weaknesses,
we implemented, and are continuing to implement, measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting. These efforts
include: 

engaging a professional accounting services firm to help us assess and document our internal controls for complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 

strengthening, formalizing, documenting and testing accounting processes and internal controls, specifically regarding accrued expenses and contract reviews and improving the information flow throughout the organization to allow for timely communication of new agreements and transactions; 

enhancing functionality of our enterprise resource planning system to support certain key financial processes and controls and enforce certain segregation of duties through automation and approval workflows. 

The measures we are implementing
are subject to continued management review supported by confirmation and testing, as well as audit committee oversight. Management and
the Audit Committee remain committed to the implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses. We will continue
to implement measures to remedy our internal control deficiencies, though there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful
or avoid potential future material weaknesses. In addition, until remediation steps have been completed and are operated for a sufficient
period of time, and subsequent evaluation of their effectiveness is completed, the material weaknesses previously disclosed, and as described
above, will continue to exist. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Except for the remediation
efforts in connection with the material weaknesses described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

38 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

In September 2024, we received
a letter with a draft Particulars of a Complaint from Stifel in which Stifel contends that the Company owes Stifel approximately 2,550,000
pursuant to a previous engagement letter entered into with Stifel on November 15, 2021 (the Engagement Letter ). Stifel alleges
that the Engagement Letter entitles them to a percentage of the value of the Company s Business Combination with Rosecliff. The
Company further believes that we have substantial factual, legal and contractual defenses to the claims presented and will vigorously
contest the claims, if ultimately brought. The Company also believes it has meritorious claims it is entitled to assert against Stifel
and one or more of its representatives. However, the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists
that the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Factors that could cause
our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 and in the Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on January 5, 2024, as
amended. Any of those factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form
10-K filed with the SEC on March 31, 2024, in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on January 5, 2024, as amended,
and in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on October 16, 2024, except as listed below. We may disclose changes
to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

The Company is not currently
in compliance with the continued listing requirements for The Nasdaq Stock Market. If the Company does not regain compliance and continue
to meet the continued listing requirements, the Common Stock may be delisted, which could affect the market price and liquidity for the
Company s Common Stock and reduce the Company s ability to raise additional capital. On June 3, 2024, the Company received
a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq that the Company was not in compliance
with the requirement of Rule 5550(b)(2) relating to the maintenance of a minimum market value of its listed securities of 35.0 million
for the last 31 consecutive business days. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has 180 calendar days from receipt
of a notice from Nasdaq (the Compliance Period ), to regain compliance with the market value of listed securities requirement.
If at any time before December 2, 2024, the closing market capitalization of the Company s Common Stock closes at or above 35.0
million for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, subject to Nasdaq s discretion to extend this period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5810(c)(3)(G) to 20 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance
with the minimum market capitalization requirement, and the matter would be resolved. If the Company does not regain compliance during
the review period ending December 2, 2024, then Nasdaq may grant the Company a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance, provided
the Company meets the continued listing requirement for all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq, other than the minimum market
value of listed securities requirement, and notifies Nasdaq of its intent to cure the deficiency. 

Although alternative public
and private transaction structures may be available, these may require additional time and cost, may impose operational restrictions on
the Company, and may not be available on attractive terms. The Company s inability to continue to raise capital with its Common
Stock as listed on Nasdaq will harm its business, financial condition and results of operations, and will likely cause the Company s
stock value to further decline.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

Yorkville Standby Equity Purchase Agreement 

On March 20, 2024, the Company
entered into the Yorkville Transaction pursuant to which the Company has the right to sell to Yorkville up to 30.0 million of its shares
of Company Common Stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA, from time to time during the term of the
SEPA. In connection with the SEPA, and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Yorkville has agreed to advance to the Company in
the form of the Convertible Notes an aggregate principal amount of up to 12.5 million (the Pre-Paid Advance ), which will
be paid in three tranches. The first Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on March 20, 2024 in the amount of 5.0 million with a fixed conversion
price of 3.16. The Company received 4.6 million in cash, net of the 8 original issue discount. On May 14, 2024, the shareholders voted
to approve the reservation and issuance of shares to Yorkville to exceed the Exchange Cap and the second Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed
on May 16, 2024 in the amount of 4.6 million, which is the 5.0 million second Pre-Paid Advance net of 0.4 million of the 8 original
issue discount, with a fixed conversion price of 2.03. The third Pre-Paid Advance was disbursed on July 17, 2024 in the principal amount
of 2.5 million with a fixed conversion price equal to 120 of the average VWAP during the three trading days immediately prior to the
issuance of the note. The purchase price for the Pre-Paid Advance is 92.0 of the principal amount of the Pre-Paid Advance. Interest shall
accrue on the outstanding balance of any Pre-Paid Advance at an annual rate equal to 0 , subject to an increase to 18 upon an event of
default as described in the Convertible Notes. 

Beginning on the forty-fifth
(45th) day following the issuance date of the Convertible Note issued in connection with the first Pre-Paid Advance, and continuing on
the same day of each successive month thereafter, (each, an Installment Date ), the Company shall repay a portion of the
outstanding balance of the Pre-Paid Advance in an amount equal to (i) 1,750,000, plus (ii) the a payment premium of 7 of such Installment
Principal Amount, and (iii) accrued and unpaid interest hereunder as of each Installment Date. The maturity date of the Convertible Notes
issue in connection with each Pre-Paid Advance will be 12 months after the issuance date of such Convertible Notes. In October 2024, the
Company and Yorkville agreed to amend the dates and the allocation of installment amounts to be paid pursuant to the Pre-Paid Advances,
such that the outstanding balance of the Pre-Paid Advances is to be paid by February 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has made
aggregate installment payments on the Pre-Paid Advances in the amount of 8.3 million, of which 7.2 million was settled in cash and 2.1
million was settled in shares. Of the aggregate installment payments, 7.1 million relates to the repayment of the principal, 0.6 million
relates to the 8 original issue discount and 0.6 million relates to the 7 payment premium. 

B. Riley Committed Equity Facility 

On December 26, 2023, the
Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with B. Riley, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in the Purchase Agreement, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to sell to B. Riley up to 10,000,000 of shares of the
common stock (subject to certain limitations contained in the Purchase Agreement), from time to time during the term of the Purchase Agreement
through a Market Open Purchase or an Intraday Purchase on any Purchase Date (each term as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Sales of
Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and the timing of any sales, are solely at our option, and we are under no obligation
to sell any securities to B. Riley under the Purchase Agreement. 

Use of Proceeds 

There has been no material
change in the planned use of the proceeds from the Business Combination, as is described in the Company s final prospectus (Registration
No. 333-275218), as filed with the SEC on January 2, 2024. Additionally, there has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds
from the ELOC or the Yorkville Transaction (Registration No. 333-278610), as is described in the Company s final prospectus (Registration
No. 333-276406), as filed with the SEC on February 1, 2024.
