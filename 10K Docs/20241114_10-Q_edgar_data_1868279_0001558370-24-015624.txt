 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our interim financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial information and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 28, 2024 (Annual Report). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should carefully read the Risk Factors sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Investors and others should note that we routinely use the Investor Relations section of our website to announce material information to investors and the marketplace. While not all of the information that we post on the Investor Relations section of our website is of a material nature, some information could be deemed to be material. Accordingly, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in us to review the information that we share on the Investors section of our website, https://ir.arrivent.com/ . Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the identification, development and commercialization of differentiated medicines to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancers. We seek to utilize our team s deep drug development experience to maximize the potential of our lead development candidate, firmonertinib, and advance a pipeline of novel therapeutics, such as next-generation antibody drug conjugates, through approval and commercialization in patients suffering from cancer, with an initial focus on solid tumors. Firmonertinib is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials across a range of epidermal growth factor receptor mutant (EGFRm) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in treatment na ve, or first-line, patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC with exon 20 insertion mutations. We received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for firmonertinib for this disease from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2023, and Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of NSCLC with EGFRm or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations or human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (HER4) mutations in February 2024. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor can help to identify the most efficient path for development. The receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not increase the likelihood that the product candidate will ultimately receive FDA approval for any indication. Firmonertinib is an investigational, novel, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that we are developing for the treatment of NSCLC patients across a broader set of EGFRm than are currently served by approved EGFR TKIs. Firmonertinib is currently only approved and commercially distributed by Shanghai Allist Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Allist) in China as a first-line therapy to treat classical EGFRm NSCLC. The FDA has not approved firmonertinib for any use. We selected firmonertinib for global development against nonclassical, or uncommon, mutations based on preliminary reductions in tumor size observed in seven out of ten patients in first-line treatment with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial, the FAVOUR trial, conducted by Allist in China, and preclinical activity in EGFR P-loop and-alpha-c-helix compressing (PACC) mutations, each a subtype of uncommon mutation. In a subsequent interim data readout from the FAVOUR trial of firmonertinib in first-line patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC with exon 20 insertion mutations, 79 of patients (n=22 out of 28 patients) were observed to experience a reduction in tumor size of at least 30 . If the future clinical 

 19 

Table of Contents 
 trial results of the FAVOUR trial are unfavorable, our clinical development plans for firmonertinib, which include conducting our global, pivotal Phase 3 FURVENT clinical trial in first-line non-squamous locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC patients with exon 20 insertion mutations, may be adversely affected. In 2021, we licensed from Allist the right to develop and commercialize firmonertinib worldwide, with the exception of greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. As one of the most prevalent cancers in the world, lung cancer imposes a significant global burden on human health, and EGFRm NSCLC represents a significant proportion of those affected. Despite progress in the therapeutic landscape for EGFRm NSCLC, many patients, particularly those with uncommon mutations, such as exon 20 insertions or PACC mutations, are underserved by existing treatments. In an interim data readout from the FAVOUR trial of firmonertinib in first-line patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC with exon 20 insertion mutations, 79 of patients (n=22 out of 28 patients) were observed to experience a reduction in tumor size of at least 30 from the baseline in a patient without evidence of progression as measured by blinded independent central review utilizing Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, which measurement of reduction is the threshold in this trial for a partial response and for inclusion in determination of the overall response rate (ORR), which is the primary endpoint of this trial. In the same interim data readout, those 79 of patients were observed to experience a 15.2-month median duration of response (DOR). Interim results may not be indicative of final results; however, we believe these interim clinical results underscore firmonertinib s potential in patients whose tumors contain an uncommon EGFRm. In September 2024, we announced positive interim proof-of-concept data from the FURTHER trial of firmonertinib in first-line patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC with PACC mutations. In this interim readout, 64 of patients (n=14 out of 22 patients) were observed to experience a reduction in tumor size of at least 30 from the baseline in a patient without evidence of progression as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria, which measurement of reduction is the threshold in this trial for a partial response and for inclusion in determination of the ORR, which is the primary endpoint of this trial. Median DOR had not yet been reached, with 90.9 (n=20/22) of patients with confirmed responses remaining on study. Interim results may not be indicative of final results; however, we believe these interim clinical results underscore firmonertinib s potential in patients whose tumors contain an uncommon EGFRm. We entered into the Global Technology Transfer and License Agreement (Allist License Agreement), pursuant to which, we have, among other things, secured an exclusive, royalty bearing and sublicensable license under certain intellectual property, including patents and know-how, owned or controlled by Allist to develop and commercialize any product containing firmonertinib or any of its salts or derivatives as an active ingredient of a product, which is led by a joint collaboration committee, comprising of representatives from both Allist and us. Under the Allist License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Allist milestone payments up to an aggregate of 765.0 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events as set forth in the Allist License Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no milestones were met or achieved. We are also obligated under the Allist License Agreement to pay Allist tiered royalties based on net sales of Licensed Products (as defined in the Allist License Agreement). See Business Licenses, Partnerships and Collaborations Allist Agreements in our Annual Report. Since our inception in April 2021, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring the rights to develop firmonertinib, clinical development of firmonertinib, business planning, raising capital, identifying potential product candidates, enhancing our intellectual property portfolio and undertaking research and clinical and preclinical studies for our development programs. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales or otherwise. We have funded our operations to date primarily through the private placement of convertible preferred stock and our initial public offering in January 2024. On January 30, 2024, we completed the closing of our initial public offering of 9,722,222 shares of common stock at a price of 18.00 per share. Additionally, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,458,333 shares of common stock at a price of 18.00 per share. The shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on January 26, 2024, under the symbol AVBP . We received net proceeds of 183.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In addition, as a result of the closing of our initial public offering, our convertible preferred stock converted into 19,567,306 shares of common stock in January 2024.

 We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and have not yet generated any revenue. Our net losses were 59.9 million and 48.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 217.7 million. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses will increase substantially as we: advance our lead product candidate, firmonertinib, through clinical trials; acquire or in-license additional product candidates; advance our preclinical programs to clinical trials; further invest in our pipeline; further support our external partners manufacturing capabilities; seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; pursue commercialization of our product candidates; maintain, expand, protect and defend our intellectual property portfolio; secure facilities to support continued growth in our research, development and commercialization efforts; increase our headcount to support our development efforts and to expand our clinical development team; and incur additional costs and headcount associated with operating as a public company. 
 In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for firmonertinib or any product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. We do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more product candidates. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other capital sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Key Components of Our Results of Operations Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses To date, our research and development expenses have been related primarily to the development of firmonertinib, preclinical studies and other clinical activities related to our portfolio. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are deferred and recognized when the goods or services are received. Research and development costs include: salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for those individuals involved in research and development efforts; 

 21 

Table of Contents 
 external research and development costs incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (CROs) and consultants to conduct our clinical trials and other preclinical studies; costs related to manufacturing our product candidates, including fees paid to third-party manufacturers and raw material suppliers; license fees and research funding; and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses, insurance, equipment and other supplies. 
 Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to CROs and consultants in connection with our clinical trials for firmonertinib, preclinical and toxicology studies and costs related to manufacturing materials for clinical and preclinical studies. Prior to our identification of potential product candidates in 2022, we did not track external costs by program. Subsequent to the identification of potential product candidates, a significant majority of our direct research and development costs have been related to firmonertinib. We deploy our personnel resources across all of our research and development activities. We plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of firmonertinib and the identification and development of new product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of future clinical trials and preclinical studies of product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate or program on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidate s commercial potential. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. Our future clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as: per patient trial costs; the number of patients needed to determine a recommended dose; the number of trials required for approval; the number of sites included in the trials; the countries in which the trials are conducted; the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; the phase of development of the product candidate; and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.

 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for those individuals in executive, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services, and insurance costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities and, if any product candidates receive marketing approval, commercialization activities. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with operating as a public company. Interest Income Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents. Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Operating expenses: Research and development 20,088 14,280 5,808 General and administrative 4,144 2,436 1,708 Total operating expenses 24,232 16,716 7,516 Operating loss (24,232) (16,716) (7,516) Interest income 3,668 2,315 1,353 Net loss (20,564) (14,401) (6,163) Research and Development We track outsourced clinical and preclinical costs and other external research and development costs associated with our lead product candidate, firmonertinib, and other discovery-stage programs. We do not track internal research and development costs by product candidate. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Firmonertinib: FURTHER 3,110 4,048 (938) FURVENT 8,959 4,746 4,213 FAVOUR 103 221 (118) Other Firmonertinib costs 886 1,899 (1,013) Total Firmonertinib 13,058 10,914 2,144 Discovery-stage programs 2,246 388 1,858 Personnel-related and other internal costs 4,784 2,978 1,806 Total research and development expenses 20,088 14,280 5,808 Research and development expenses were 20.1 million and 14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 5.8 million was primarily due to an increase of 2.1 million related to our lead product candidate, firmonertinib, as well as increases of 1.9 million in preclinical discovery work and 1.8 million in personnel-related costs due to increased headcount. Costs related to firmonertinib increased as a result of 

 23 

Table of Contents 
 increased costs related to our FURVENT Phase 3 clinical trial of 4.2 million, offset by a decrease of 0.9 million in our FURTHER Phase 1 clinical trial, a decrease in costs related to our FAVOUR trial, and a decrease in general firmonertinib costs. Discovery-stage program costs increased due to an option exercise payment to Aarvik Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Aarvik) related to our collaboration with them. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were 4.1 million and 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 1.7 million was due primarily to increases of 0.8 million in personnel-related costs, and 0.9 million in insurance, taxes, and outside services. Interest Income Interest income was 3.7 million and 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest income is due to increased invested balances and increased average market yields. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Operating expenses: Research and development 58,841 44,874 13,967 General and administrative 11,762 6,598 5,164 Total operating expenses 70,603 51,472 19,131 Operating loss (70,603) (51,472) (19,131) Interest income 10,748 3,332 7,416 Net loss (59,855) (48,140) (11,715) Research and Development We track outsourced clinical and preclinical costs and other external research and development costs associated with our lead product candidate, firmonertinib, and other discovery-stage programs. We do not track internal research and development costs by product candidate. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Firmonertinib: FURTHER 10,444 12,296 (1,852) FURVENT 24,259 18,375 5,884 FAVOUR 133 1,230 (1,097) Other Firmonertinib costs 2,455 2,489 (34) Total Firmonertinib 37,291 34,390 2,901 Discovery-stage programs 8,860 1,088 7,772 Personnel-related and other internal costs 12,690 9,396 3,294 Total research and development expenses 58,841 44,874 13,967 Research and development expenses were 58.8 million and 44.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 14.0 million was primarily due to an increase of 2.9 million related to our lead product candidate, firmonertinib, an increase of 3.3 million in personnel-related costs due to increased headcount, and an increase of 7.8 million in preclinical discovery work. Costs related to firmonertinib increased as a

Table of Contents 
 result of increased costs related to our FURVENT Phase 3 clinical trial of 5.9 million, offset by a decrease of 1.9 million related to our FURTHER Phase 1b clinical trial, a decrease of 1.1 million related to our FAVOUR trial, and a decrease in other general firmonertinib costs. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were 11.8 million and 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 5.1 million was due primarily to increases of 2.4 million in personnel-related costs, 1.2 million in outside services, and 1.4 million in software, insurance, and taxes. Interest Income Interest income was 10.7 million and 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest income is due to increased invested balances and increased average market yields. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity We have previously funded our operations primarily through the private placement of convertible preferred stock and our initial public offering of common stock. To date, we have raised gross proceeds of 305.0 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, we completed our initial public offering of 11,180,555 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of 18.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,458,333 additional shares of our common stock, for aggregate proceeds of 183.2 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 282.9 million. Future Funding Requirements We plan to continue to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through additional public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other capital sources. Debt or equity financing or collaborations and partnerships with other entities may not be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may be required to scale back or discontinue the advancement of product candidates, reduce headcount or reduce other operating expenses. This could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve certain of our planned objectives, and thus, materially harm our business. Our ability to successfully transition to profitability will depend upon obtaining additional financing and achieving a level of product sales adequate to support our cost structure. We cannot be assured that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flows from operating activities. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements into 2026. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of drug discovery, preclinical studies and clinical trials of our lead product candidate, firmonertinib, and any other product candidates; the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue; the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; the cost of manufacturing firmonertinib, if approved, and future product candidates for clinical trials in preparation for marketing approval and in preparation for commercialization; 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 the costs of any third-party products used in our combination clinical trials that are not covered by such third party or other sources; the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase; the receipt of marketing approval and revenue received from any potential commercial sales of firmonertinib or other product candidates; the cost of commercialization activities for firmonertinib and future product candidates we develop if we receive marketing approval, including marketing, sales and distribution costs; the emergence of competing therapies and other adverse market developments; the ability to establish and maintain strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; the extent to which we in-license or acquire other products and technologies; and the costs of operating as a public company. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our platform technology, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (54,060) (40,929) Investing activities (25,000) Financing activities 186,526 43,916 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 132,466 (22,013) Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 54.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting our net loss of 59.9 million, offset by 2.3 million in stock-based compensation and a 3.5 million net increase in our operating assets and liabilities attributable to the timing in which we pay our vendors for research and development activities. 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 41.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflecting our net loss of 48.1 million, offset by 0.6 million in stock-based compensation, and a 6.6 million net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities attributable to the timing in which we pay our vendors for research and development activities. Investing Activities No net cash was provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in investing activities was 25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was attributable to the purchase of short-term investments. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 186.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the net proceeds from our initial public offering. Net cash provided by financing activities was 44.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the issuance of Series B convertible preferred stock. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party CROs and clinical trial sites for our clinical trials, and with supply vendors for other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and, therefore, are cancelable contracts. We have leases for office space in Gaithersburg, Maryland and Burlingame, California that extend through January 2025 and January 2026, respectively. Amounts related to future lease payments as of September 30, 2024 totaled 0.2 million, to be paid within the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, except for the operating leases, we did not have any long-term obligations, capital lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities. We also have commitments for obligations under our agreements with Allist, Jiangsu Alphamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. and Aarvik. Under these agreements we are required to make milestone payments upon successful completion of certain clinical, regulatory, development, sales and commercial milestones. Additionally, we are required to make royalty payments in connection with the sale of products developed under these agreements. Because the achievement of these milestones and royalties is not probable and payment is not required as of September 30, 2024, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. For additional information regarding our agreements, see Note 9 to our accompanying financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued research and development and stock-based compensation expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies from those described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates included in the Annual Report.

 JOBS Act and Emerging Growth Company Status As an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Sarbanes-Oxley). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our initial public offering , (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), which would occur if, among other factors, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year (subject to certain conditions) or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 3 to our accompanying financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in an interest-bearing savings account and money market account. As a result, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant, and a hypothetical 1.0 change in market interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on the total value of our portfolio. Foreign Currency We do not regularly incur any material expenses with vendors outside the United States or that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may incur such expenses in the future at which point exchange rate fluctuations might adversely affect our expenses, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. To date, exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material effect on our results of operations.

 Effects of Inflation Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs. We do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented and do not anticipate a material impact going forward. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. You should read this description of our controls and procedures together with Item 9A. Controls and Procedures included in our Annual Report. However, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than the material weakness remediation activities described below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as identified in connection with evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we have taken steps of implementing our remediation plans with respect to the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, with the oversight of senior management, including our Chief Financial Officer and our audit committee, we continued implementing processes and controls to address the material weaknesses. We have increased the number of resources (internal and third-party) dedicated to our accounting and finance team, including personnel with additional knowledge, experience, and training, to ensure we have adequate staff, to segregate key duties, and to comply with company policies and procedures. We have also engaged a third-party provider to help us assess and improve our internal controls in preparation for compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley. Additionally, we continue to make progress on implementing written policies and implementing process level and management review controls for our manual journal entries. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in remediating the material weaknesses we identified or that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. 

 29 

Table of Contents 
 While we believe that these efforts will improve our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with GAAP and SEC reporting requirements, the implementation of these measures is ongoing and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until our management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period of time and our management has concluded through testing that these controls are effective. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and are continuing to implement, will be sufficient to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Item 1A. Risk Factors Other than as described below, there have been no additional material changes to our risk factors as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report. You should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report. We face significant competition, and if our competitors develop and commercialize technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do, or their technologies or product candidates are more effective, safer, or less expensive than firmonertinib or any future product candidates we develop, our business and our ability to develop and successfully commercialize products will be adversely affected. The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel products and product candidates. Our competitors have developed, are developing or may develop products, product candidates and processes competitive with firmonertinib. Firmonertinib and any future product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Our competitors include larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, biotechnological and therapeutics companies. Moreover, we may also compete with universities and other research institutions who may be active in research in our target indications and could be in direct competition with us. We also compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel, and our inability to compete successfully could negatively affect our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan. We will also face competition in establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling subjects for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing intellectual property related to new product candidates, as well as entering into collaborations, joint ventures, license agreements and other similar arrangements. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We believe that our current and future competition for resources and eventually for customers comes from companies that are commercializing or developing candidates targeting EGFRm-positive NSCLC, including, but not limited to, AstraZeneca, Johnson Johnson, , Dizal Pharmaceutical, Oric Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Black Diamond Therapeutics, Inc., Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Taiho Pharmaceutical), Boehringer Ingelheim Bayer AG, and Pierre Fabre. In October 2023, Johnson Johnson presented the results of their Phase 3 PAPILLON study of chemotherapy in combination with the anti-EGFR anti-MET (mesenchymal epithelial transition) bispecific antibody amivantamab in first-line NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, and in July 2023 announced that the PAPILLON study met its primary endpoint. In March 2024, the FDA approved Johnson Johnson s chemotherapy in combination with amivantamab in first-line NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, and similar approvals were granted to Johnson Johnson by the European Medicines Agency in June 2024 and by Japan s Pharmaceuticals and Medical

 Devices Agency in September 2024. Johnson Johnson has also received FDA approvals for amivantamab in combination with lazertinib in first-line NSCLC patients with classical EGFR mutations and is seeking or has received similar approvals from other regulatory bodies globally. In addition, Dizal Pharmaceutical and Cullinan Therapeutics, Inc., in a partnership with Taiho Pharmaceutical, have initiated Phase 3 trials for sunvozertinib and zipalertinib in combination with chemotherapy, respectively, in first-line NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Black Diamond Therapeutics and Oric Pharmaceuticals have presented initial Phase 1 data on BDTX-1535 and ORIC-114, respectively, in NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations, which includes some PACC mutations. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience than we do. If we successfully obtain approval for firmonertinib or any future product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the safety and effectiveness of our products, the ease with which our products can be administered, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement coverage and patent position. Competing products could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, more convenient, less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competing products may render firmonertinib or any future product candidates we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our product candidates. If we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of our products we may develop, if approved, could be adversely affected. See the section entitled, Business Competition in our Annual Report for more information. We currently rely on a Chinese third party for the manufacture of furmonertinib for clinical development and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the foreseeable future. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of furmonertinib or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or potential commercialization efforts. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and have no plans to develop our own clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. We rely on a third party, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of furmonertinib and related raw materials for clinical development, as well as for commercial manufacture if furmonertinib receives marketing approval. The facilities used by third-party manufacturers to manufacture furmonertinib must be approved by the FDA and any comparable foreign regulatory authority pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an NDA to the FDA or make any comparable submission to a foreign regulatory authority. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, third-party manufacturers for compliance with cGMP requirements for manufacture of products. If these third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of furmonertinib or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market furmonertinib, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations also could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of furmonertinib or other future products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and our financial position. Our or a third party s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements on commercially reasonable terms, in a timely manner and in compliance with cGMP or other regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including: an inability to initiate or complete clinical trials of furmonertinib or any future product candidates in a timely manner; 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 delay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving marketing approvals, for furmonertinib or any future product candidates; subjecting third-party manufacturing facilities or our potential future manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory authorities; requirements to cease development or to recall batches of furmonertinib or any future product candidates; and in the event of approval to market and commercialize furmonertinib or any future product candidates, an inability to meet commercial demands for furmonertinib or any future product candidates. In addition, we do not have any long-term commitments or supply agreements with any third-party manufacturers. We may be unable to establish any long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms, which increases the risk of failing to timely obtain sufficient quantities of furmonertinib or such quantities at an acceptable cost. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including: failure of third-party manufacturers to comply with regulatory requirements and maintain quality assurance; breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party; failure to manufacture our product candidates according to our specifications; failure to obtain adequate raw materials and other materials required for manufacturing; failure to manufacture our product according to our schedule or at all; failure to successfully scale up manufacturing capacity, if required; misappropriation of our proprietary information, including any potential trade secrets and know-how; and termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. 
 Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval or jeopardize our ability to commence or continue commercialization of furmonertinib or any future product candidates, and any related remedial measures may be costly or time consuming to implement. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for all required raw materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates. If our existing or future third-party manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers and we may be unable to replace them on a timely basis or at all. Without additional suppliers of required raw materials, we may also be unable to meet the commercial needs of a commercial launch of any future product candidates. In addition, our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of furmonertinib and any future product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis. A portion of our product development and manufacturing for our product candidate furmonertinib takes place in China through third-party manufacturers. A significant disruption in the operation of those manufacturers, a trade war or political unrest in China, or a change in the regulatory framework in the United States or China, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Currently, we rely on and have agreements with two third-party contract manufacturers, Raybow and WuXi STA to supply the drug substance for furmonertinib to be used in planned clinical trials and with WuXi STA, with whom we have executed technology transfer related to the manufacture of drug product, to manufacture the clinical trial supplies of furmonertinib drug product. Both of third-party contract manufacturers are located in China, and we expect to continue to use such third-party manufacturers for such product candidates. Any disruption in production or inability of our manufacturers in China to produce adequate quantities to meet our needs, whether as a result of a natural disaster, or other causes could impair our ability to operate our business on a day-to-day basis and to continue our development of our product candidates. Furthermore, since these manufacturers are located in China, we are exposed to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the U.S. or Chinese governments, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China. For example, a trade war could lead to tariffs on the chemical intermediates we use that are manufactured in China.

 Recently, the Biden administration has signed multiple executive orders regarding China. One particular executive order titled Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy signed on September 12, 2022 will likely impact the pharmaceutical industry to encourage U.S. domestic manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. I In February 2024, certain U.S. Senators and Representatives sent a letter to the Biden administration requesting that both WuXi AppTec, WuXi STA s parent company, and the affiliated WuXi Biologics be added to the Department of Defense s Chinese Military Companies List (1260H list), the Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security Entity List, and the Department of Treasury s Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List. While the Biden administration has yet to take action on this letter, adding WuXi STA on any or all of the aforementioned lists could materially impact supply of furmonertinib from WuXi STA. In addition, there have been Congressional legislative proposals, such as a bill titled the BIOSECURE Act, to discourage contracting with certain Chinese companies, including two WuXi affiliates, on the development or manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. The BIOSECURE Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives on September 9, 2024. The version of the BIOSECURE Act that passed the U.S. House of Representatives included a grandfather clause that would allow contracts entered into with the Chinese companies named therein prior to the effective date of such legislation until January 1, 2032. The BIOSECURE Act must also pass the U.S. Senate before going to the President for either his veto or signature, and it is uncertain whether the bill will be brought to the floor for a vote by the U.S. Senate before the current legislative session expires on January 3, 2025. There can be no assurance that the final text of the BIOSECURE Act, to the extent it is signed into law, will contain the grandfather clause described above, or any other provision contained in the version of the BIOSECURE Act that passed the U.S. House of Representatives. If this bill becomes law, or similar laws are passed, these regulations would have the potential to restrict our ability to contract with certain Chinese biotechnology companies. Such restrictions could cause delays or have other adverse effects on the development of certain of our research programs. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. For example, in the event that we need to switch our third-party manufacturer of furmonertinib from WuXi STA, we anticipate that the complexity of the manufacturing process may impact the amount of time it may take to secure a replacement manufacturer. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer, once we are able to identify an alternative source, could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. a) Sales of Unregistered Securities None. b) Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock On January 25, 2024, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No 333-276397) relating to our initial public offering of common stock was declared effective by the SEC. Upon the closing of the initial public offering, we issued 11,180,555 shares of common stock (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 1,458,333 shares of common stock) at a public offering price of 18.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of 183.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. None of the expenses associated with our initial public offering were paid to directors, officers, persons owning 10 or more of any class of equity securities, or to our affiliates. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from the initial public offering from that described in the prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on January 26, 2024. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None.
