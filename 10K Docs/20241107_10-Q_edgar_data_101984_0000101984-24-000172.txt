Note 1 

Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," and the "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" included in Items 1A, 7, 7A, and 8, respectively, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
 With the exception of the following policy, our significant accounting policies are unchanged from those disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 . Forfeitures of stock-based awards are accounted for as they occur. Upon the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock awards or the vesting of performance stock awards, newly issued shares of our common stock are issued. Our stock-based compensation awards are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and are not timed or coordinated with the release of material, non-public information. 
 
 We determine the fair value of restricted stock awards with a service condition utilizing the average of the high and low trading prices of our common shares on the date they were granted. 
 
 The fair value of performance stock awards with a market condition is determined utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the grant date. The assumptions utilized in a Monte Carlo simulation model include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, term of the award and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate over the expected term is equal to the prevailing U.S. Treasury note rate over the same period. Expected volatility is determined utilizing historical volatility. The dividend yield is assumed to be since we have not historically declared dividends and do not have any plans to declare dividends in the future. 
 
 The fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes model include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected life in years and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate over the expected term is equal to the prevailing U.S. Treasury note rate over the same period. Expected volatility is determined utilizing historical volatility over a period of time equal to the expected life of the stock option. Expected life is computed utilizing historical exercise patterns and post-vesting behavior. The dividend

 China Line of Credit 
 
 On August 29, 2024, our subsidiary Gemstar Technology (Yangzhou) Co. Ltd. ("GTY"), executed a Line of Credit Agreement (the "Line of Credit Agreement") with the Bank of China, which provides for a revolving line of credit ("China Credit Line") through July 24, 2025. We expect to renew our Line of Credit Agreement with the Bank of China prior to its expiration; however, no assurance can be given that future financing will be available or, if available, that we will be offered terms satisfactory to us. The China Credit Line may be used for working capital purposes. 
 
 The China Credit Line has a maximum availability up to RMB million (approximately million), subject to meeting certain financial conditions. 
 
 Amounts available for borrowing under the China Credit Line are reduced by the balance of any outstanding letters of credit, of which there were none at September 30, 2024. 
 
 All obligations under the China Credit Line are secured by the mortgage of GTY's buildings and land use rights. 
 
 Under the Line of Credit Agreement, we may elect to pay interest on the China Credit Line based on the one-year rate from the National Interbank Funding Center less a margin. There are no associated commitment fees on the China Credit Line. The interest rate in effect at September 30, 2024 was . 
 
 The Line of Credit Agreement includes financial covenants and contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Our covenants are based on a debt to asset ratio and a dividends paid to net income ratio. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the Line of Credit Agreement. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had RMB million (approximately million) outstanding under the China Credit Line. At September 30, 2024, our remaining availability under our China Credit Line was RMB million (approximately million). Our total interest expense on borrowings under the China Credit Line was RMB thousand (approximately thousand) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded income tax expense of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily attributable to the mix of pre-tax income among jurisdictions, including losses not benefited as a result of a valuation allowance. 
 
 The difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the 21.0 U.S. federal statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the mix of pre-tax income and loss among jurisdictions and permanent tax items, including a tax on global intangible low-taxed income. The Company's income tax provision can be affected by other factors, including changes in the tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and other discrete items. 
 
 At December 31, 2023, we assessed the realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. At December 31, 2023, we had a three-year cumulative operating loss for our U.S. operations and, accordingly, have provided a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no change to our U.S. valuation allowance position. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million, including interest and penalties, which, if not for the valuation allowance recorded against the state Research and Experimentation income tax credit, would affect the annual effective tax rate if these tax benefits are realized. Further, we are unaware of any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase within the next twelve months. Based on U.S. federal, state and foreign statute expirations in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. We have classified uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities unless they are expected to be paid within one year. 
 
 We have elected to classify interest and penalties as a component of tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties are immaterial at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and are included in the unrecognized tax benefits.

 Roku Matters 
 
 2018 Lawsuit 
 
 On September 5, 2018, we filed a lawsuit against Roku, Inc. ("Roku") in the United States District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Roku is willfully infringing of our patents that are in patent families related to remote control set-up and touchscreen remotes. On December 5, 2018, we amended our complaint to add additional details supporting our infringement and willfulness allegations. We have alleged that this complaint relates to multiple Roku streaming players and components therefor and certain universal control devices, including but not limited to the Roku App, Roku TV, Roku Express, Roku Streaming Stick, Roku Ultra, Roku Premiere, Roku 4, Roku 3, Roku 2, Roku Enhanced Remote and any other Roku product that provides for the remote control of an external device such as a TV, audiovisual receiver, sound bar or Roku TV Wireless Speakers. In October 2019, the Court stayed this lawsuit pending action by the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (the "PTAB") with respect to Roku's requests for Inter Partes Review ("IPR") and with respect to the International Trade Commission Investigation. At this time, we are only waiting for the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court with respect to Roku's appeal request (see discussion below) and once received, we expect to be able to ask the District Court to lift this stay. 
 
 International Trade Commission Investigation of Roku, TCL, Hisense and Funai 
 
 On April 16, 2020, we filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (the "ITC") against Roku, TCL Electronics Holding Limited and related entities (collectively, "TCL"), Hisense Co., Ltd. and related entities (collectively, "Hisense"), and Funai Electric Company, Ltd. and related entities (collectively, "Funai") claiming that certain of their televisions, set-top boxes, remote control devices, human interface devices, streaming devices, and sound bars infringe certain of our patents. We asked the ITC to issue a permanent limited exclusion order prohibiting the importation of these infringing products into the United States and a cease and desist order to stop these parties from continuing their infringing activities. On May 18, 2020, the ITC announced that it instituted its investigation as requested by us. Prior to the trial, which ended on April 23, 2021, we dismissed

 (Unaudited) 

 of our patents and TCL, Hisense, and Funai are willfully infringing of our patents by incorporating our patented technology into certain of their televisions, set-top boxes, remote control devices, human interface devices, streaming devices and sound bars. The Court stayed this lawsuit pending action by the PTAB with respect to Roku's requests for IPR and with respect to the International Trade Commission Investigation. At this time, we are only waiting for the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court with respect to Roku s appeal request (see discussion above) and once received, we expect to be able to ask the District Court to lift this stay. 
 
 Inter Partes Reviews 
 
 Throughout these litigation matters against Roku and the others identified above, Roku has filed multiple IPR requests with the PTAB on all patents at issue in the 2018 Lawsuit, the ITC Action, and the 2020 Lawsuit (see discussion above). To date, the PTAB has denied Roku's request times, and granted Roku's request times. Roku has since filed IPRs on of our patents not yet asserted against it, and we are awaiting the PTAB's institution decision with respect to those new IPR requests. Of the IPR requests granted by the PTAB, the results were mixed, with the PTAB upholding the validity of many of our patent claims and invalidating others. Most of these PTAB actions have been completed, and as soon as we learn the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, we expect to be able to petition the District Court to lift the stay on the 2018 and 2020 cases. 
 
 International Trade Commission Investigation Request Made by Roku against UEI and certain UEI Customers 
 
 On April 8, 2021, Roku made a request to the ITC to initiate an investigation against us and certain of our customers claiming that certain of our and those customers' remote control devices and televisions infringe of Roku's recently acquired patents, the '511 patent and the '875 patent. On May 10, 2021, the ITC announced its decision to initiate the requested investigation. Immediately prior to trial Roku stipulated to summary determination as to its complaint against us and of our customers with respect to of the patents at issue. This stipulation resulted in the complaint against us and of our customers with respect to that patent not going to trial. The trial was thus shortened and ended on January 24, 2022. On June 24, 2022, the ALJ, pursuant to Roku's stipulation, found the '511 patent invalid as indefinite. Thereafter, on June 28, 2022, the ALJ issued an ID fully exonerating us and our customers finding the '875 patent invalid and that Roku failed to prove it established the requisite domestic industry and thus no violation of the Tariff Act. In advance of the full Commission's review, Roku and we filed petitions to appeal certain portions of the ID. In addition, the PTAB granted our request for an IPR with respect to the '875 patent. On October 28, 2022, the full ITC issued its final determination affirming the ID, ruling there was no violation of the Tariff Act and terminated the investigation. In December 2022, Roku filed an appeal, which remains pending. In addition, Roku, along with the ITC, filed a joint motion to dismiss the '511 patent as moot as it recently expired. We are opposing this motion. Further, on October 23, 2023, the PTAB issued its Final Written Decision invalidating all of the claims Roku alleges we infringe. As a companion to its ITC request, on April 8, 2021, Roku also filed a lawsuit against us in Federal District Court

 patents they alleged being infringed in the ITC investigation explained above. This District Court case has been stayed pending the ITC case, and will likely continue to be stayed pending the conclusion of Roku's appeal of the ITC case. 
 
 Court of International Trade Action against the United States of America, et. al. 
 
 On October 9, 2020, we and our subsidiaries, Ecolink Intelligent Technology, Inc. ("Ecolink") and RCS Technology, LLC ("RCS"), filed an amended complaint (20-cv-00670) in the Court of International Trade (the "CIT") against the United States of America; the Office of the United States Trade Representative; Robert E. Lighthizer, U.S. Trade Representative; U.S. Customs Border Protection; and Mark A. Morgan, U.S. Customs Border Protection Acting Commissioner, challenging both the substantive and procedural processes followed by the United States Trade Representative ("USTR") when instituting Section 301 Tariffs on imports from China under Lists 3 and 4A. 
 
 Pursuant to this complaint, Ecolink, RCS and we are alleging that USTR's institution of Lists 3 and 4A tariffs violated the Trade Act of 1974 (the "Trade Act") on the grounds that the USTR failed to make a determination or finding that there was an unfair trade practice that required a remedy and moreover, that Lists 3 and 4A tariffs were instituted beyond the 12-month time limit provided for in the governing statute. Ecolink, RCS and we also allege that the manner in which the Lists 3 and 4A tariff actions were implemented violated the Administrative Procedures Act (the "APA") by failing to provide adequate opportunity for comments, failing to consider relevant factors when making its decision and failing to connect the record facts to the choices it made by not explaining how the comments received by USTR came to shape the final implementation of Lists 3 and 4A. 
 
 Ecolink, RCS and we are asking the CIT to declare that the defendants' actions resulting in the tariffs on products covered by Lists 3 and 4A are unauthorized by and contrary to the Trade Act and were arbitrarily and unlawfully promulgated in violation of the APA; to vacate the Lists 3 and 4A tariffs; to order a refund (with interest) of any Lists 3 and 4A duties paid by Ecolink, RCS and us; to permanently enjoin the U.S. government from applying Lists 3 and 4A duties against Ecolink, RCS and us; and award Ecolink, RCS and us our costs and reasonable attorney's fees. 
 
 In July 2021, the CIT issued a preliminary injunction suspending liquidation of all unliquidated entries subject to Lists 3 and 4A duties and has asked the parties to develop a process to keep track of the entries to efficiently and effectively deal with liquidation process and duties to be paid or refunded when finally adjudicated. On February 5, 2022, the CIT heard oral arguments on dispositive motions filed on behalf of plaintiffs and defendants. On April 1, 2022, the CIT issued its opinion on these dispositive motions, ruling that the USTR had the legal authority to promulgate List 3 and List 4A under Section 307(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act, but that the USTR violated the APA when it promulgated List 3 and List 4A concluding that the USTR failed to adequately explain its decision as required under the APA. The Court ordered that List 3 and List 4A be remanded to the USTR for reconsideration or further explanation regarding its rationale for imposing the tariffs. The Court declined to vacate List 3 and List 4A, which means that they are still in place while on remand. The Court's preliminary injunction regarding liquidation of entries also remains in effect. The Court initially set a deadline of June 30, 2022, for the USTR to complete this process, which was extended to August 1, 2022. 
 
 On August 1, 2022, the USTR provided the Court with that further explanation and also purported to respond to the significant comments received during the original notice-and-comment process. On September 14, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed its comments to the USTR's August 1, 2022 filing, asserting that the USTR did not adequately respond to the Court's remand order and requested the Court to vacate the List 3 and List 4A tariffs and issue refunds immediately. On March 17, 2023, the CIT sustained the List 3 and List 4 tariffs, concluding that USTR s rationale in support of the tariffs was not impermissibly post hoc. The Court also concluded that USTR adequately explained its reliance on presidential direction and adequately responded to significant comments regarding the harm to the U.S. economy, efficacy of the tariffs, and alternatives to the tariffs. Lead plaintiffs have appealed this decision. The parties have fully briefed their positions on this appeal and oral argument is expected to be set for later in 2024 and a decision sometime in 2025. 
 
 Tongshun Matters 
 
 On January 23, 2024, Tongshun Company ("TS") filed suit against one of our subsidiaries, GTY, claiming among other things, breach of an employment agency contract, and as is standard in Chinese litigation matters such as these, TS has also requested the court to order a hold on GTY's bank account for the total claimed amount of RMB million. This asset protection order is a standard request and routinely granted. On February 5, 2024, we learned that the court accepted the lawsuit filed by TS. On

 million (approximately million) with the court. On July 12, 2024, we were refunded RMB million (approximately million) of the original deposit. This deposit is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We have ongoing settlement discussions and while such discussions continue, the hearing on this matter has been stayed. 
 
 There are no other material pending legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or of which our respective property is the subject. However, as is typical in our industry and to the nature and kind of business in which we are engaged, from time to time, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced by third parties against us or by us against third parties arising from or related to product liability, infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights, breach of warranty, contractual relations, or employee relations. The amounts claimed may be substantial, but may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the claims or the extent of any real risk of court awards assessed against us or in our favor. However, no assurances can be made as to the outcome of any of these matters, nor can we estimate the range of potential losses to us. In our opinion, final judgments, if any, which might be rendered against us in potential or pending litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Moreover, we believe that our products do not infringe any third parties' patents or other intellectual property rights. 
 
 We maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance which insures our individual directors and officers against certain claims, as well as attorney's fees and related expenses incurred in connection with the defense of such claims.

Table of Contents 

A key factor in creating products and software for control of entertainment devices is our proprietary device knowledge. Each year our device discovery and control libraries continue to grow across AV and smart home platforms, supporting many common smart home protocols, including IR, HDMI-CEC, Zigbee (Rf4CE), Z-Wave, IP, as well as Home Network and Cloud Control. 
 
 Our technology also includes other remote controlled home entertainment devices and home automation control modules, as well as wired Consumer Electronics Control ("CEC") and wireless IP control protocols commonly found on many of the latest HDMI and internet connected devices. Our proprietary software automatically detects, identifies and enables the appropriate control commands for many home entertainment and automation devices in the home. Our libraries are continuously updated with device control codes used in newly introduced AV and Internet of Things ("IoT") devices. These control codes are captured directly from original control devices or from the manufacturer's written specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the library. 
 
 We operate as one business segment. We have one domestic subsidiary and 24 international subsidiaries located in Brazil, British Virgin Islands, France, Germany, Hong Kong (3), India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico (2), the Netherlands, People's Republic of China (the "PRC") (6), Singapore, Spain, United Kingdom and Vietnam. 
 
 To recap our results for the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 Net sales decreased 4.7 to 102.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 107.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our gross margin percentage increased to 30.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 29.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 32.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our operating income was 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to operating loss of 14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our operating income percentage was 0.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an operating loss percentage of 13.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income tax expense was 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our strategic business objectives for 2024 include the following: 
 
 deliver new standard products, as well as custom variants, currently on our project development backlog, specifically in the climate control channel; 
 broaden our home control and home automation product offerings with the aim of acquiring new customers that represent market share leaders in their respective channels and regions; 
 expand our software and service platform, QuickSet, to deliver new features that enhance the personalization and engagement of users on smart entertainment and smart home platforms; 
 execute go-to-market strategies that help position our sustainable technology in our major verticals; 
 seek acquisitions or strategic partners that complement and strengthen our existing business; and 
 expedite our long-term factory planning strategy to optimize our manufacturing footprint. 
 
 We intend for the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 
 We have been negatively impacted and we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions, in particular reduced consumer spending on durable goods. We have also been adversely impacted by inflationary pressures, including increased component and logistics costs and increases in wages and costs of borrowing funds. To help offset these negative impacts, we have implemented cost saving measures including rightsizing our manufacturing footprint and reducing operational and administrative headcount; however, such measures may not fully offset the impact of lower sales demand and 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 cost increases, which would negatively impact our gross margins and overall financial results. Management will continue to seek ways to lessen the impact these pressures may have on our margins and overall financial results by executing on our plan to reduce our manufacturing overhead and to locate alternative and less expensive sources of component parts and materials. 
 
 Manufacturing Footprint 
 
 We have been evaluating our global manufacturing footprint based upon our long-term factory planning strategy to reduce our manufacturing capacity due to decreased demand and a change in mix of our products. As part of this evaluation, we are working to downsize and streamline the Mexico operations by moving to a smaller, more efficient facility. We commenced operations in this downsized facility in the second quarter of 2024. We continue to evaluate our global factory footprint to identify ways to operate more efficiently. Decisions may result in charges that could have a material effect on the consolidated the financial statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and income taxes. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates, and they may be adjusted as more information becomes available. Any adjustment may be significant and may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 An accounting estimate is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably may have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may materially impact the financial statements. We do not believe that there have been any significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 1 contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

 The following table sets forth our reported results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.

Table of Contents 

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 102.1 million compared to 107.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We have experienced lower customer demand in both our home entertainment and climate control channels. Our home entertainment channel continues to be adversely affected by cord cutting, while our climate control channel is experiencing a decrease in demand in Europe, which we believe is a result of recent reductions in governmental subsidies for heat pump technology. 
 
 Gross profit. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.7 million compared to 20.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 30.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we took a charge of 7.7 million for the impairment of fixed assets related to the execution of our factory footprint optimization plan, which negatively impacted the gross profit rate for that period by 700 basis points. The execution of our factory footprint optimization plan has resulted in a significant reduction of excess manufacturing capacity, yielding a gross margin rate improvement of approximately 400 basis points. 
 
 Research and development ("R D") expenses. R D expenses decreased to 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to reduced third-party product development costs and a reduction in headcount. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses. SG A expenses decreased slightly to 22.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a decrease in variable expenses associated with lower sales volume. 
 
 Factory restructuring charges. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 0.1 million in expense, including severance and moving costs associated with the streamlining of our factory in Mexico. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 3.7 million in expense, which included severance and non-severance closure expenses in our southern China factory, as well as expenses to move equipment from our Mexico factory to our Vietnam factory. 
 
 Interest income (expense), net. Interest expense, net decreased to 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a lower average loan balance. 
 
 Other income (expense), net. Other income, net was 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other expense, net 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement was primarily due to a reduction in net foreign currency losses, partially offset by less gains from the sale of manufacturing assets. 
 
 Provision for income taxes. Income tax expense was 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, relative to a pre-tax loss of 0.2 million, compared to income tax expense of 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, relative to a pre-tax loss of 16.1 million. Consistent with 2023, we expect the U.S. to be in a pre-tax loss position without benefit for the full year 2024, resulting in an elevated effective tax rate. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 284.4 million compared to 322.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We have experienced lower customer demand in both our home entertainment and climate control channels. Our home entertainment channel continues to be adversely affected by cord cutting, while our climate control channel is experiencing a decrease in demand in Europe, which we believe is a result of recent reductions in governmental subsidies for heat pump technology. 
 
 Gross profit. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 82.7 million compared to 69.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 29.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The execution of our factory footprint optimization plan has resulted in a significant reduction of excess manufacturing capacity, yielding a gross margin rate improvement of approximately 360 basis points. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we took a charge of 7.7 million for the impairment of fixed assets related to the execution of our factory footprint optimization plan, which negatively impacted the gross profit rate for that period by 240 basis points. In addition, favorable product mix and a stronger U.S. dollar resulted in a 90 basis point and 60 basis point improvement, respectively, in our gross margin rate.

 R D expenses. R D expenses decreased to 22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to reduced third-party product development costs and a reduction in headcount. 
 
 SG A expenses. SG A expenses decreased to 68.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 75.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a reduction in headcount, a decrease in outside legal expenses related to a specific legal matter, and a decrease in variable expenses associated with lower sales volume. 
 
 Factory restructuring charges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 2.7 million in expense, including severance and moving costs associated with the streamlining of our factory in Mexico and the closure of our southern China factory. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 3.7 million in expense, which included severance and non-severance closure expenses in our southern China factory, as well as expenses to move equipment from our Mexico factory to our Vietnam factory. 
 
 Goodwill impairment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 49.1 million due to our market capitalization being significantly less than the carrying value of our equity. 
 
 Interest income (expense), net. Interest expense, net decreased to 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a lower average loan balance. 
 
 Other income (expense), net. Other income, net was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other expense, net 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement was primarily due to a reduction in net foreign currency losses. 
 
 Provision for income taxes. Income tax expense was 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, relative to a pre-tax loss of 13.5 million, compared to income tax expense of 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, relative to a pre-tax loss of 87.7 million. Consistent with 2023, we expect the U.S. to be in a pre-tax loss position without benefit for the full year 2024, resulting in an elevated effective tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Cash 
 
 Historically, we have utilized cash provided from operations as our primary source of liquidity, as internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to support our business operations, capital expenditures and discretionary share repurchases. In addition, we have utilized our credit line to fund share repurchases and past acquisitions. We anticipate that we will continue to utilize both cash flows from operations and our revolving lines of credit to support ongoing business operations, capital expenditures, expenses associated with our long-term factory planning strategy, future discretionary share repurchases and potential future acquisitions. We believe our current cash balances, anticipated cash flow to be generated from operations and available borrowing resources will be sufficient to cover expected cash outlays for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter; however, because our cash is located in various jurisdictions throughout the world, we may at times need to increase borrowing from our revolving lines of credit or take on additional debt until we are able to transfer cash among our various entities. 
 
 Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks discussed under "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk." 
 
 (In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 26,287 42,751 Available borrowing resources 37,158 70,000 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents On September 30, 2024, we had 2.2 million, 10.7 million, 2.7 million, 5.7 million and 5.0 million of cash and cash equivalents in North America, the PRC, Asia (excluding the PRC), Europe, and South America, respectively. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to liquidity, credit and other relevant risks by placing our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions we believe are high quality.

 Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world. The majority of our cash is held outside of the United States and may be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, may be subject to federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. Additionally, repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. 
 
 Available Borrowing Resources Our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("Second Amended Credit Agreement") with U.S. Bank National Association ("U.S. Bank") provides for a revolving line of credit ("U.S. Credit Line") that expires on April 30, 2025. We expect to renew our credit agreement with U.S. Bank prior to its expiration; however no assurance can be given that future financing will be available or, if available, that we will be offered terms satisfactory to us. The U.S. Credit Line has a maximum availability up to 100.0 million, subject to meeting certain financial conditions, including an accounts receivable coverage ratio ("AR Ratio"). This AR Ratio is calculated monthly and adjusts the current U.S. Credit Line total availability. At September 30, 2024, the U.S. Credit Line total availability was 65.6 million based upon the AR Ratio. At October 11, 2024, the U.S. Credit Line total availability was 67.0 million based upon the AR Ratio. 
 
 The U.S. Credit Line may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions, share repurchases and capital expenditures. Amounts available for borrowing under the U.S. Credit Line are reduced by the balance of any outstanding letters of credit, of which there were none at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding balance of 37.0 million on our U.S. Credit Line and 28.6 million of availability. 
 
 Our subsidiary, Gemstar Technology (Yangzhou) Co. Ltd. ("GTY"), has a Line of Credit Agreement ("Line of Credit Agreement") with the Bank of China, which provides for a revolving line of credit ("China Credit Line" and, together with the U.S. Credit Line, "Credit Lines") through July 24, 2025. We expect to renew the Line of Credit Agreement with the Bank of China prior to its expiration; however, no assurance can be given that future financing will be available or, if available, that we will be offered terms satisfactory to us. The China Credit Line has a maximum availability up to RMB 80.0 million (approximately 11.4 million), subject to meeting certain financial conditions. 
 
 The China Credit Line may be used for working capital purposes. Amounts available for borrowing under the China Credit Line are reduced by the balance of any outstanding letters of credit, of which there were none at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding balance of RMB 20.0 million (approximately 2.9 million) on our China Credit Line and RMB 60.0 million (approximately 8.6 million) of availability. 
 
 See Note 8 contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further information regarding our Credit Lines. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 Our cash flows were as follows: 
 (In thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Cash provided by (used for) operating activities 8,339 (11,737) 20,076 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities (6,691) 4,792 (11,483) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities (17,102) (3,214) (13,888) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (1,010) 356 (1,366) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (16,464) (9,803) (6,661) 
 
 September 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 26,287 (16,464) 42,751 Working capital 89,520 (8,183) 97,703 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 8.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss was 19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss of 91.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which includes the impairment of goodwill of 49.1 million and long-lived assets of 7.8 million. Depreciation and amortization was 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to decreased purchases of property, plant and equipment over recent years. Inventories increased by 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a decrease of 45.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The significant decrease in inventories during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily the result of cord 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 cutting, as there was less demand for our video service products. In addition, lead times for components and raw materials have normalized, enabling more efficient production planning. Our inventory turns increased to 3.2 turns at September 30, 2024 from 2.9 turns at September 30, 2023. Changes in accounts receivable and contract assets resulted in cash inflows of 5.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, largely as a result of a decrease in sales. Days sales outstanding were 91 days at September 30, 2024 compared to 92 days at September 30, 2023. Changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted in cash outflows of 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a decrease in inventory purchases and timing of payments throughout the quarter. Changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted in cash outflows of 21.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to a decrease in inventory purchases. 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.7 million, of which 3.5 million and 3.2 million was used for capital expenditures and the development of patents, respectively. Net cash used for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 11.5 million, of which 6.8 million and 4.7 million was used for capital expenditures and the development of patents, respectively. 
 
 Future cash flows used for investing activities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures. We estimate that we will incur between 1.0 million and 2.0 million during the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Net cash used for financing activities was 17.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were borrowings and repayments on our Credit Lines and repurchases of shares of our common stock. Net repayments on our Credit Lines were 15.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 200,552 shares of our common stock at a cost of 1.9 million compared to our repurchase of 61,298 shares at a cost of 0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Future cash flows used for financing activities are affected by our financing needs, which are largely dependent on the level of cash provided by or used in operations and the level of cash used in investing activities. Additionally, potential future repurchases of shares of our common stock will impact our cash flows used for financing activities. See Note 13 contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further information regarding our share repurchase programs. 
 
 Material Cash Commitments The following table summarizes our material cash commitments and the effect these commitments are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods: 
 
 Payments Due by Period (In thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 4 - 5 years After 5 years Credit Lines 39,853 39,853 Inventory purchases 7,909 7,909 Operating lease obligations 16,230 5,348 6,617 1,950 2,315 Property, plant, and equipment purchases 
 1,175 1,175 Software license 7,282 941 2,198 2,539 1,604 Total material cash commitments 72,449 55,226 8,815 4,489 3,919 
 
 We anticipate meeting our material cash commitments with our cash generated from operations and available borrowing resources, including our Credit Lines. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of these risks and the use of financial instruments to mitigate our risk exposure. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt. From time to time, we borrow amounts on our Credit Lines for working capital and other liquidity needs. Under the Second Amended Credit Agreement with U.S. Bank, we may elect to pay interest on outstanding borrowings on our U.S. Credit Line based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus an 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 applicable margin as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement. Under our Line of Credit Agreement with the Bank of China, we may elect to pay interest on outstanding borrowings on our China Credit Line based on the one-year rate from the National Interbank Funding Center, less a 0.1 margin. Accordingly, changes in interest rates would impact our results of operations in future periods. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have an approximately 0.3 million annual impact on net income based on our outstanding Credit Lines balance at September 30, 2024. 
 
 We cannot make any assurances that we will not need to borrow additional amounts in the future or that funds from the existing Credit Lines will continue to be available to us or that other funds will be extended to us under comparable terms or at all. If funding is not available to us at a time when we need to borrow, we would have to use our cash reserves, including potentially repatriating cash from foreign jurisdictions, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had wholly-owned subsidiaries in Brazil, the British Virgin Islands, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, the PRC, Singapore, Spain, United Kingdom and Vietnam. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases, operating expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The most significant foreign currencies to our operations are the Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Euro, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Vietnamese Dong, Indian Rupee, Hong Kong Dollar, Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen and Korean Won. Our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the Chinese Yuan Renminbi as this is the functional currency of our China-based factories where the majority of our products originate. If the Chinese Yuan Renminbi were to strengthen against the U.S. Dollar, our manufacturing costs would increase. We are generally a net payor of the Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Mexican Peso, Vietnamese Dong, Indian Rupee, Hong Kong Dollar, Japanese Yen and Korean Won and therefore benefit from a stronger U.S. Dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker U.S. Dollar relative to the foreign currency. For the Euro, British Pound and Brazilian Real, we are generally a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. Dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver, a weaker U.S. Dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone. 
 
 From time to time, we enter into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted income and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The terms of these foreign currency exchange agreements normally last less than nine months. We recognize the gains and losses on these foreign currency contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency-denominated exposures. 
 
 It is difficult to estimate the impact of fluctuations on reported income, as it depends on the opening and closing rates, the average net balance sheet positions held in a foreign currency and the amount of income generated in local currency. We routinely forecast what these balance sheet positions and income generated in local currency may be and we take steps to minimize exposure as we deem appropriate. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge. We do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes. 
 
 The sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to variability in exchange rates is assessed by applying an approximate range of potential rate fluctuations to our assets, obligations and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currency with all other variables held constant. The analysis includes all of our foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures. Based on our overall foreign currency rate exposure at September 30, 2024, we believe that movements in foreign currency rates may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. We estimate that if the exchange rates for the Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Euro, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Indian Rupee, Hong Kong Dollar, Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen, Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong relative to the U.S. Dollar fluctuate 10 from September 30, 2024, net income in the fourth quarter of 2024 would fluctuate by approximately 6.0 million. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Rule 13a-15(d) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") defines "disclosure controls and procedures" to mean controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. The definition further states that disclosure controls and 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We are subject to lawsuits arising out of the conduct of our business. The discussion of our litigation matters contained in "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 12" is incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The reader should carefully consider, in connection with the other information in this report, the risk factors discussed in "Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors" of the Company's 2023 Form 10-K and in the periodic reports we have filed since then. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and elsewhere. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 The following table sets forth, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total stock repurchases, average price paid per share and the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased on the open market under our plans or programs: 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) 
 Weighted Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (2) 
 July 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 256 11.48 778,362 August 1, 2024 - August 31, 2024 5,171 10.11 778,362 September 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024 778,362 Total 5,427 10.17 
 (1) Of the repurchases in July and August, 256 and 5,171 shares, respectively, represent common shares of the Company that were owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted shares. 
 (2) On October 26, 2023, our Board approved a share repurchase program with an effective date of November 7, 2023 (the "October 2023 Program"). Pursuant to the October 2023 Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. Per the terms of the October 2023 Program, we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, including open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some or all of which could be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans.
