, under the name Friendly
Auto Dealers, Inc., under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first quarter of 2011 the Company changed its name from Friendly Auto
Dealers, Inc. to Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc., and acquired Splint Decisions, Inc., a California corporation. 

Business
Description 

Currently
the Company is focused on immune modulation for the treatment of several specific diseases. Immune modulation refers to the ability to
upregulate (make more active) or downregulate (make less active) one s immune system. 

Activating
one s immune system is now an accepted method to treat certain cancers, reduce recovery time from viral or bacterial infections
and to prevent illness. Additionally, inhibiting one s immune system is vital for reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders and
allergic reactions. 

TSOI
is developing a range of immune-modulatory agents to target certain cancers, schizophrenia, suicidal ideation, traumatic brain injury,
and for daily health. 

Nutraceutical
Division TSOI has been producing high quality nutraceuticals. Its current flagship product, QuadraMune , is a multi-patented
synergistic blend of pterostilbene, sulforaphane, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and thymoquinone. QuadraMune has been shown to increase
Natural Killer Cell activity and healthy Cytokine production. 

Regenerative
Medicine TSOI obtained exclusive rights to a patented adult stem cell for development of therapeutics in the area of chronic
traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Lung Pathology (LP). 

The
stem cell licensed, termed JadiCell is unique in that it possesses features of mesenchymal stem cells, however, outperforms
these cells in terms of a) enhanced growth factor production; b) augmented ability to secrete exosomes; and c) superior angiogenic and
neurogenic ability. Subsequent to this acquisition the Company has filed an additional 22 patents on this population of unique mesenchymal
like stromal cells. 

Immunotherapies 

TSOI
has a large portfolio of immunotherapies that range from dendritic cell vaccines for cancers to Parkinson s disease developed on
our StemVacs platform.

Going
Concern 

Management
does not expect existing cash as of September 30, 2024, to be sufficient to fund the Company s operations for at least twelve months
from the issuance date of these financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumed
the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024,
the Company has incurred losses totaling million since inception, has not yet generated material revenue from operations, and will
require additional funds to maintain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and obtain the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company intends to finance operating
costs over the next twelve months through its existing financial resources and we may also raise additional capital through equity offerings,
debt financings, collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required
to delay, reduce the scope of, or curtail, our operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

owned subsidiary Res Nova Bio, Inc. and its owned subsidiary Campbell Neurosciences, Inc. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. No material activity in any subsidiaries.

Returns.
 Revenue is adjusted based on an estimate of the expected returns based on historical rates. Our
estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our most recent historical experience of actual customer returns. Additionally, we
consider other factors when estimating our current period return provision, including levels of inventory in our distribution channel
as well as significant market changes which may impact future expected returns, and make adjustments to our current period provision
for returns when it appears product returns may differ from our original estimates. These returns have not been significant to the Company s
revenues in the accompanying financial statements.

must reject them at the time of delivery up to five (5) business days from the date of delivery. If Buyer has not rejected the Goods
within five (5) business days from the date of delivery, Buyer shall have waived any right to reject that specific delivery of Goods.
In the event Buyer rejects the Goods, Buyer shall allow Seller a reasonable time to cure the deficiency. A reasonable time period shall

Shipping.
 Shipping Time Most orders will ship the next business day, provided the product ordered is in stock. Orders are not processed
or shipped on Saturday or Sunday, except by prior arrangement. We cannot guarantee when an order will arrive. Consider any shipping or
transit time offered to the customer by this site or other parties only as an estimate. We encourage the customer to order in a timely
fashion to avoid delays caused by shipping or product availability. Fulfillment mistakes that may be made which result in the shipment
of incorrect products to the customer will also be accepted for return. 

Out
of Stock. We will ship the customer s product as it becomes available. Usually, products ship by the next business day. However,
there may be times when the product the customer had ordered is out-of-stock, which will delay fulfilling the customer s order.
We will keep the customer informed of any products that the customer had ordered that are out-of-stock and unavailable for immediate
shipment. The Customer may cancel their order at any time prior to shipping.

As
a matter of policy, the Company does not invest in separable financial derivatives or engage in hedging transactions. However, the Company
entered into certain debt financing transactions in fiscal 2024 and 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 containing certain conversion features
that have resulted in the instruments being deemed derivatives. We evaluate such derivative instruments to properly classify such instruments
within equity or as liabilities in our financial statements. Our policy is to settle instruments indexed to our common shares on a first-in-first-out
basis. 

The
classification of a derivative instrument is reassessed at each reporting date. If the classification changes as a result of events during
a reporting period, the instrument is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. There is no limit on
the number of times a contract may be reclassified. 

Instruments
classified as derivative liabilities are remeasured using the Black-Scholes model at each reporting period (or upon reclassification)
and the change in fair value is recorded on our consolidated statement of operations. We recorded derivative liabilities of 0 and 
at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

with a third party for which the proceeds were used for operations. The Company received net proceeds of and
a original issuance discount was recorded. Three of these notes in the principal amount of incur a one-time interest
charge of at the issuance date, which was withheld as an original issuance discount, and are due in four monthly payments ranging
from August 15, 2024 through May 15, 2025. . The Company
was required to reserve at September 30, 2024 a total of common shares in connection with these promissory notes. 

Derivative
liabilities 

These
convertible promissory notes are convertible into a variable number of shares of common stock for which there is not a floor to the number
of common stock we might be required to issue. Based on the requirements of ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, the conversion feature represented
an embedded derivative that is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a separate derivative liability. The derivative liability
is originally recorded at its estimated fair value and is required to be revalued at each conversion event and reporting period. Changes
in the derivative liability fair value are reported in operating results each reporting period. 

For
the notes issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company valued the conversion feature on the date of issuance resulting
in an initial liability of . Since the fair value of the derivative was in excess of the proceeds received, a full discount to
convertible notes payable and a day one loss on derivative liabilities of was recorded during the nine months ended September
30, 2024. Upon issuance, the Company valued the conversion feature using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
conversion price ranging from to , the closing stock price of the Company s common stock on the date of valuation
ranging from to , an expected dividend yield of , expected volatility ranging from to , risk-free interest
rate ranging from to , and an expected term ranging from year to . 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, convertible notes with principal, default penalty, and accrued interest balances totaling 
were converted into shares of common stock. At each conversion date, the Company recalculated the value of the derivative
liability associated with the convertible note recording a gain (loss) in connection with the change in fair market value. In addition,
the fair value of the shares of common stock issued in excess or deficit of the pro-rata portion of the derivative liability as compared
to the portion of the convertible note converted was recorded as a loss or gain on derivative liabilities. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company recorded to gain on derivative liabilities in connection with these conversions. The derivative
liabilities were revalued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: conversion prices ranging from
 to , the closing stock price of the Company s common stock on the date of valuation ranging from to ,
an expected dividend yield of , expected volatility ranging from to , risk-free interest rates ranging from to ,
and expected terms of to years. 

On
September 30, 2024, there were no derivative liabilities on the remaining convertible notes resulting in a gain of for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, related to the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities. 

The
Company amortizes the discounts over the term of the convertible promissory notes using the straight-line method which is similar to
the effective interest method. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company amortized and 
to interest expense, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, discounts of remained which will be amortized through May 2025.

Description 

Currently
the Company is focused on immune modulation for the treatment of several specific diseases. Immune modulation refers to the ability to
upregulate (make more active) or downregulate (make less active) one s immune system. 

Activating
one s immune system is now an accepted method to treat certain cancers, reduce recovery time from viral or bacterial infections
and to prevent illness. Additionally, inhibiting one s immune system is vital for reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders,
and allergic reactions. 

TSOI
is developing a range of immune-modulatory agents to target certain cancers, schizophrenia, suicidal ideation, traumatic brain injury,
and for daily health. 

Nutraceutical
Division TSOI has been producing high quality nutraceuticals. Its current flagship product, QuadraMune , is a multi-patented
synergistic blend of pterostilbene, sulforaphane, epigallocatechingallate, and thymoquinone. QuadraMune has been shown to increase Natural

Aneurysm
Treatment by Exosomes 

On
May 1, 2023, the Company announced launching VasoSome Vascular Inc., based on successful treatment of Aortic Aneurysms using patent pending
exosome therapy. 

At
present there is no treatment available for AAA other than open surgical or endovascular repair, both of which carry significant risks.
The Company is currently at an early stage of development but seeks to be first-in-man clinical trials. 

20 

Abdominal
Aortic Aneurysms 

An
AAA is a localized dilation or ballooning of the abdominal aorta. Prevalence approaches 5 in men over 60 years and increases
with age. About 7.5 of men over 65 years are affected. Aneurysm disease currently affects about 1.7m individuals in the United States.
The prevalence is expected to exceed 3m by 2025 with the baby boomers reaching their seventh decade. 

The
natural history of AAA is progressive growth, leading to rupture and death. The growth rate is about 0.3cm per year and the rate of growth
accelerates as the aneurysm gets bigger. Most AAA s are asymptomatic and remain undetected until they rupture. 

More
than 80 of patients who suffer a ruptured AAA don t survive long enough to reach a hospital and 50-70 of those who do reach a
hospital don t survive treatment. The likelihood of rupture increases dramatically as the AAA grows. At 5.5cm, the one year incidence
of rupture is about 9 , rising to 33 as the aneurysm grows to 7cm. Ruptured AAA s are a leading cause of death in the USA, and
are the 10 th leading cause of death for men over 55 years. In the US, 1-2 of all male deaths in the over 65 years cohort
are due to AAA. Only 10 of patients with AAA are still alive 8 years after diagnosis compared to 65 of a similar normal population.
Those who die lose an average of nine years of life. 

Technology 

VasoSome s
product VSX-001 is a proprietary nanoparticle derived from specialized stem cells that can be utilized in a universal donor 
manner, meaning it does not have to be matched with the donor. The product possesses numerous properties of stem cells, including inhibition
of inflammation, suppression of damage to blood vessels, and ability to regenerate damaged tissue. Advantages of administering VSX-001
compared to stem cells include: a) VSX-001 is substantially smaller in size than stem cells, allowing for superior distribution; b)
VSX-001 does not multiply, thus possessing a superior long-term safety profile; and c) VSX-001 can be manufactured more economically
as compared to stem cells. 

Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) 

On
April 20, 2023, the Company filed with the USFDA an Investigational Drug Application (IND) to initiate a Phase III Clinical Trial for
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. 

ARDS
is a condition in which lung injury causes fluid to leak into the spaces between the capillaries and the alveoli. Pressure on the alveoli
increases, and eventually fluid accumulates. Fluid in the lungs causes the alveoli to collapse, leading to a series of cascading problems,
each further decreasing the lungs capacity to move oxygen into the blood, and directly impacting the body s tissues and
organs. ARDS afflicts approximately 198,000 Americans a year and is expected to reach a 19.5 billion dollar a year market by 2029. 

Chronic

titled as: Protection and Regeneration of Neurological Function by Using Stem Cells as well as the sale and transfer of
Investigational New Drug Application titled as: Investigation of Umbilical Cord derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of Chronic
Traumatic Encephalopathy Patients. 

Chronic
Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is caused by repetitive concussive/sub-concussive hits to the head sustained over a period of years and
is often found in football players. The condition is characterized by memory loss, impulsive/erratic behavior, impaired judgment, aggression,
depression, and dementia. In many patients with CTE, it is anatomically characterized by brain atrophy, reduced mass of frontal and temporal
cortices, and medial temporal lobe. 

Traumatic
brain injury (TBI) is an insult to the brain, not of a degenerative or congenital nature, but caused by external physical force that
may produce a diminished or altered state of consciousness, which results in an impairment of cognitive abilities or physical functioning. 

CTE
represents a significant unmet medical need which we believe is amenable to stem cell intervention. We are eager to accelerate treatments
and potential cures for debilitating conditions such as CTE and traumatic brain injury and plan to leverage New regulatory pathways such
as the recently approved Right to Try Law to deliver these medicines as soon as possible to patients which currently have
no other options. 

Schizophrenia/Suicide
Clinical Programs 

On
October 29, 2020, the Company announced publication on the NIH clinical trials website of its newly initiated trial aiming to validate

Treatment
of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Using COPDcell Universal Donor Adult Stem Cells 

On
October 7, 2022, the Company formed Breathe Biologics, Inc. and licensed to them a patent application titled Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal
Stem Cells for Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Lung Degeneration that discloses means of treating lung
degenerative diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CODP) using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells such as COPDcell s. 

In
addition, the Company has transferred ownership of the filed investigational drug application titled JadiCell Therapy for COPD 
to determine safety and efficacy of intravenously administered allogeneic JadiCell umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells in patients
with moderate-to-severe COPD. The Primary Endpoint, which is toxicity, will be assessed by number of adverse events (AEs). The Secondary
Endpoint, which is efficacy will be evaluated at baseline and days 30, 60, and 90. 

COPD
is a consistently progressive, ultimately fatal disease for which no treatment exists capable of either reversing or even interrupting
its course. It afflicts more than 5 of the population in many countries, and it accordingly represents the third most frequent cause
of death in the U.S., where it accounts for more than 600 billion in health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. 

COPD
possesses several features making it ideal for stem cell-based interventions: a) the quality of life and lack of progress demands the
ethical exploration of novel approaches. For example, bone marrow stem cells have been used in over a thousand cardiac patients with
some indication of efficacy. Adipose-based stem cell therapies have been successfully used in thousands of racehorses and companion animals
without adverse effects, as well as numerous clinical trials are ongoing and published human data reports no adverse effects. 

Mesenchymal
Stem Cells (MSCs) are potent immunomodulatory cells that recognize sites of injury, limit effector T cell reactions, and stimulate regulatory
cell populations i.e., T-regs) via growth factors, cytokines, and other mediators. Simultaneously, MSCs also stimulate local
tissue regeneration via paracrine effects inducing angiogenic, anti-fibrotic and remodeling responses. Consequently, MSCs-based therapy
represents a viable treatment option for autoimmune conditions and other inflammatory disorders, yielding beneficial effects in models
of autoimmune Type 1 Diabetes, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis, Multiple Sclerosis, cardiac insufficiency,
and organ transplantation. MSCs have been reported to inhibit inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs, have shown safety in clinical trials
for ARDS, and have been recently suggested as useful to treat patients with severe COVID-19 based on their effects preventing or attenuating
the immunopathogenic cytokine storm. 

Unfortunately,
evaluation of stem cell therapy in COPD has lagged behind other areas of regenerative investigation; b) the underlying cause of COPD
appears to be inflammatory and/or immunologically mediated. The destruction of alveolar tissue is associated with T cell reactivity,
pathological pulmonary macrophage activation, and auto-antibody production. Mesenchymal stem cells have been demonstrated to potently
suppress autoreactive T cells, inhibit macrophage activation, and autoantibody responses. Additionally, mesenchymal stem cells can be
purified in high concentrations from adipose stromal vascular tissue together with high concentrations of T regulatory cells, which in
animal models are approximately 100 times more potent than peripheral T cells at secreting cytokines therapeutic for COPD such as IL-10.
Additionally, use of adipose derived cells has yielded promising clinical results in autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis;
and c) Pulmonary stem cells capable of regenerating damaged parenchymal tissue have been reported. Administration of mesenchymal stem
cells into neonatal oxygen-damaged lungs, which results in COPD-like alveoli dysplasia, has been demonstrated to yield improvements in
two recent publications. 

23 

Based
on the above rationale for stem cell-based COPD treatments, we are proposing a 10 patient Phase I safety trial to assess ability of our
COPDcell, a type of umbilical cord derived stem cells to improve objective and quality of life parameters in patients with moderate to
severe COPD. 

MSCs
can be derived in large number from the Umbilical Cord (UC). COPDcells are a type of UC-MSCs, which can be utilized in the allogeneic
setting and have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials for a number of disease conditions including inflammatory and immune-based
diseases. UC-MSCs have been shown to inhibit inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs. 

Breast
Cancer Immunotherapy 

Recently
the Company announced the formation of a Spin-Off Company, Res Nova Bio, Inc., dedicated to the development of cancer inhibiting anti-angiogenesis
immunotherapies. Res Nova Bio has licensed from Therapeutic Solutions International intellectual property covering StemVacs-V which is
our iPSC derived platform technology announced in May of 2021. The technology utilizes pluripotent stem cells called iPSCs in order to
generate new cells which resemble tumor blood vessels that are made to act as a therapeutic vaccine . Specifically, the
administration of StemVacs-V stimulates the immune system to selectively kill blood vessels that feed the tumor but not healthy blood
vessels. It is believed that for every 1 tumor blood vessel cell that is killed, 200-300 tumor cells are also killed as a result. 

In
addition to the license, the Company has transferred ownership of the IND titled Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer
by StemVacs-V Cancer Immunotherapeutic to Res Nova Bio with the primary objective being safety and feasibility of StemVacs-V administration
at 12 months as assessed by lack of adverse medical events. The secondary objective is efficacy as judged by tumor response, time to
progression, and immunological monitoring.

statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We
base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that re not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements. 

Overview 

Currently
the Company is focused on immune modulation for the treatment of several specific diseases. Immune modulation refers to the ability to
upregulate (make more active) or downregulate (make less active) one s immune system. 

Activating
one s immune system is now an accepted method to treat certain cancers, reduce recovery time from viral or bacterial infections
and to prevent illness. Additionally, inhibiting one s immune system is vital for reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders and
allergic reactions. 

TSOI
is developing a range of immune-modulatory agents to target certain cancers, schizophrenia, suicidal ideation, traumatic brain injury,
and for daily health. 

Nutraceutical
Division TSOI has been producing high quality nutraceuticals. Its current flagship product, QuadraMune , is a multi-patented
synergistic blend of pterostilbene, sulforaphane, epigallocatechingallate, and thymoquinone. QuadraMune has been shown to increase Natural
Killer Cell activity and healthy Cytokine production. Our synergistic blend of ingredients helps the immune system fight off common and
complex ailments and promote healthy T Cell activity. Recently the Company was approved to sell certain nutraceuticals on the Amazon
Platform. 

Cellular
Division TSOI recently obtained exclusive rights to a patented adult stem cell for development of therapeutics in the area
of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and lung pathology. 

For
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

We
had a net loss of 2,035,427 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 602,857 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,432,570. This increase was mainly due to increases in Consulting fees. We had net loss of 3,264,052
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 1,743,994 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase
of 1,520,058. This increase was mainly due to increases in Consulting and Legal and Professional Fees. 

Net
sales decreased 6,063, from 25,730 to 19,667 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. Net
sales decreased 13,675, from 75,161 to 61,486, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. This decrease
was mainly due to a decrease in sales of the Company s line of products. 

26 

Cost
of goods sold decreased 2,643 from 7,052 to 4,409, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Cost of goods
sold decreased 7,591 from 26,217 to 18,626, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. These decreases were
mainly a result of decreases in net sales for products in 2024. 

Operating
expenses for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1,974,779 and 476,013, an increase of 1,498,766. Operating
expenses for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3,079,660 and 1,478,652, an increase of 1,601,008. This
increase was mainly due to an increase in consulting and legal and professional fees. 

General
and administrative expenses increased 2,611, from 127,204 to 129,815 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively.
General and administrative expenses decreased 18,584, from 359,948 to 341,364 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024,
respectively. This decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in selling expenses as sales decreased. 

Salaries,
wages, and related expenses decreased 5,940, from 111,220 to 105,280 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024,
respectively. Salaries, wages, and related expenses decreased 15,887, from 335,699 to 319,812 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in wage-related expenses. 

Consulting
fees increased 1,548,413 from 20,150 to 1,568,563 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Consulting
fees increased 1,693,118 from 142,907 to 1,836,025 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, due to consulting
fees for the Campbell Neurosciences dividends to Therapeutic Solutions International s shareholders. 

Legal
and professional fees increased 86,508 from 68,560 to 155,068 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively.
Legal and professional fees increased 260,272 from 229,952 to 490,224 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively,
due to an increase in general counsel services handling filings with the SEC and new subsidiaries. 

Research
and development decreased 132,826, from 148,879 to 16,053 for three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Research
and development decreased 317,911, from 410,146 to 92,235 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively,
due to a decrease in research and development. 

Gain
on derivatives liability increased approximately 21,391, from a loss of 2,336 to a gain of 19,055 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Loss on derivatives liability decreased approximately 16,710, from a gain of 21,939 to 5,229 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in
the amount of new convertible notes being issued during the current period. 

Change
in fair derivatives liabilities gains increased approximately 71,509 from a loss of 60,124 to a gain of 11,385 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Change in fair derivatives liabilities gains increased approximately 131,704 from a
loss of 93,836 to a gain of 37,868 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. This increase was largely due
to an increase in the balance of convertible notes outstanding upon which the derivative liability is recorded. 

Net
interest expense increased 23,284 from 83,062 to 106,346 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Net
interest expense decreased 57,586 from 327,135 to 269,549 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. This
decrease was mainly due to conversion of debt to stock. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have experienced recurring losses over the past years which have resulted in accumulated deficits of approximately 22.3 million and
a working capital deficit of approximately 1.3 million at September 30, 2024. These conditions raise significant doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to
secure additional financing, increase sales of its products and attain profitable operations. It is the intent of management to continue
to raise additional capital. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such additional funds or obtain
such on terms satisfactory to the Company, if at all. 

There
is no guarantee we will receive the required financing to complete our business strategies, and it is uncertain whether future financing
will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop
or expand our operations.

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As
a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled
disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide this information requested by this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

A.
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September
30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, these officers concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, these disclosure controls and procedures were not operating effectively to ensure that the information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues,
if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can
be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

B.
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that
materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September
30, 2024. In making our assessment, we used the framework and criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO (2013). Based on that assessment, our management has identified certain material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Our
management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, and that material
weaknesses existed in the following areas as of September 30, 2024. 

(1) 
 we
 do not employ full time in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting issues surrounding
 certain complex or non-routine transactions. With respect to material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will
 continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions; 

(2) 
 we
 have inadequate segregation of duties consistent with the control objectives including but not limited to the disbursement process,
 transaction or account changes, and the performance of account reconciliations and approval; 

(3) 
 we
 have ineffective controls over the period end financial disclosure and reporting process caused by insufficient accounting staff. 

28 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, claims are made against us in the ordinary course of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated
litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties or
injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more products or engaging in other activities. The occurrence of an unfavorable outcome
in any specific period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period or future periods. 

However,
as of the date of this report, management believes the outcome of currently identified potential claims and lawsuits will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

No
material changes to risk factors have occurred as previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024.
