VOR BIOPHARMA INC. 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (UNAUDITED) 
 . Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to a number of risks common to development stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, risks of failure of preclinical studies and clinical trials, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, reliance on third party organizations, risks of obtaining regulatory approval for any product candidate that it may develop, development by competitors of technological innovations, compliance with government regulations, adverse macroeconomic conditions and the need to obtain additional financing. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as it continues to develop its product candidates. As a result, the Company s continued operations are dependent on its ability to raise additional funding. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, it may be forced to significantly curtail, delay, or discontinue one or more of its planned research or development programs or be unable to expand its operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of million. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as it continues to develop its product candidates. As a result, the Company s continued operations are dependent on its ability to raise additional funding. Based on its current business plan and current capital resources, combined with the need to raise additional funding and the uncertainty regarding the availability of such additional funding, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Management's plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include obtaining additional funding through equity or debt offerings and/or pursuant to collaboration or licensing arrangements. However, additional funding may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The Company may also seek to reduce current spending requirements where necessary. Management has concluded the likelihood that its plans to successfully obtain sufficient additional funding from one or more of these sources, or adequately reduce expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. If, for any reason, the Company utilizes its capital resources more quickly than anticipated or is unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, it may be required to revise its business plan and strategy. This may result in the Company significantly curtailing, delaying or discontinuing one or more of its research and development programs. As a result, the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section titled Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report and in other reports we have filed or may file with the SEC, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Overview 
 Vor Bio is a clinical-stage company harnessing the power of cell and genome engineering to develop potentially transformative therapies in acute myeloid leukemia AML ), a devastating disease with few treatment options. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults and one of the deadliest and most aggressive blood cancers, affecting approximately 20,000 newly diagnosed patients each year in the United States. 
 Leveraging our expertise in HSC biology and genome engineering, we genetically modify HSCs to remove surface targets and then provide these cells as hematopoietic cell transplants HCTs to patients. Once these cells engraft into bone marrow, the patient s healthy cells are shielded because they no longer express the surface target, leaving only the cancerous cells exposed. We believe this will unlock the potential of targeted therapies to selectively destroy cancerous cells while shielding healthy cells. As a result, our shielded transplants are designed to limit the on-target toxicities associated with these targeted therapies, thereby enhancing their utility, and broadening their applicability. We intend to pair our shielded transplants with targeted therapeutics such as antibody drug conjugates ADCs or VCAR33 ALLO , a chimeric antigen receptor CAR )-T therapy designed to target CD33, to bring potentially transformative outcomes to patients and establish a new standard of care Treatment System in AML. 
 We are developing trem-cel, a shielded transplant, which we believe has the potential to transform the treatment for AML and other blood cancers. Trem-cel is created by genetically modifying healthy donor HSCs in order to remove the CD33 surface target. We intend to develop trem-cel as a HCT product candidate to replace the standard of care in transplant settings. We are actively enrolling and treating patients in VBP101, our first-in-human Phase 1/2a trial of trem-cel in combination with Mylotarg. We released clinical data on 18 patients treated in this trial in September 2024. The data demonstrated: 
 Reliable engraftment, robust platelet recovery, and high CD33 editing efficiency with full myeloid chimerism at Day 28; 

Shielding of the blood system, with maintained neutrophil and platelet counts across multiple Mylotarg doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/m 2 ; 

Broadened therapeutic index for Mylotarg with drug exposure represented by AUC which is related to efficacy, consistent with labeled Mylotarg doses, and with maximal concentrations, measured by C max and related to veno-occlusive disease, well below known toxic range; and 

Early evidence suggesting patient benefit as measured by relapse-free survival when compared to published high-risk AML comparators, with only four patients relapsing, two of which occurred before Mylotarg treatment, and two occurring following Mylotarg, both with TP53 mutation. 

We expect to provide our next clinical data update at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2024 annual meeting in December 2024. 
 VCAR33 ALLO is manufactured from lymphocytes collected from the patient s original transplant donor, generating a CAR-T cell product that is exactly matched to the recipient s engrafted blood system. By using healthy transplant donor cells as the starting material to produce VCAR33 ALLO , the CAR-T cells have a more stem-like phenotype, leading to greater potential for expansion, persistence, and anti-leukemia activity compared to a product derived from a patient s own lymphocytes. In January 2024 we dosed the first patient with VCAR33 ALLO in VBP301 and are continuing to dose patients in this study. In September 2024, we announced encouraging in vivo CAR-T expansion data from the first three patients treated, all at the lowest dose of 1 x 10 6 CAR+ cells/kg. 
 We believe that the combination of trem-cel followed by	 treatment with VCAR33 ALLO in the post-transplant setting, which we refer to as the trem-cel + VCAR33 Treatment System, may transform patient outcomes and offer the potential for cures for patients that have limited treatment options. The trem-cel + VCAR33 Treatment System would utilize the same healthy donor allogenic cell source for both trem-cel and VCAR33 ALLO . We plan to collect initial data on trem-cel from the VBP101 clinical trial and initial 
 12 

clinical data from the VCAR33 ALLO program prior to IND submission for the trem-cel + VCAR33 Treatment System. However, the VBP301 protocol allows for patients who have received a trem-cel transplant on the VBP101 study to enroll in VBP301 and receive VCAR33 ALLO . This may provide valuable early insights into the potential of the trem-cel + VCAR33 Treatment System to enable a more potent therapy and durable responses post-transplant. 
 In September 2024, we announced a new preclinical asset, VADC45, which has a number of potential opportunities in oncology, gene therapy, and autoimmune disorders. VADC45 is an ADC designed to target the CD45 protein. CD45 is a well-validated target for a wide variety of blood cancers with clinical proof of concept. The linker-payload used in VADC45 is also clinically validated. VADC45 has the potential to treat a number of diseases, including treatment of hematologic malignancies, as a targeted conditioning agent for gene therapies such as for sickle cell disease, holistic immune reset for autoimmune disorders, and for our approach of combining this asset with epitope modification of CD45 to shield healthy stem cells. We already have robust preclinical data for VADC45 and are progressing IND-enabling studies to enable future Phase 1 studies. 
 We operate an in-house clinical manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to support development of our shielded transplants and CAR-T therapeutic candidates for patients with blood cancers. While this facility is now operational, we continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturers for our required raw materials, manufacturing devices, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished product for our research and clinical manufacturing. Since our inception in December 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to raising capital, organizing and staffing our company, business and scientific planning, conducting discovery and research activities, acquiring or discovering product candidates, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, developing and progressing our product candidates and preparing for clinical trials, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and component materials, building out our internal clinical manufacturing facility, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Through September 30, 2024, we funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt financings and have received aggregate net proceeds from these transactions of approximately 464.4 million. 
 We have incurred significant operating losses since inception, including net losses of 27.6 million and 86.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 426.3 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 62.8 million. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2025. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Revenue 
 We have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in marketing approval, or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such agreements.

Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of external and internal expenses incurred in connection with our research and development activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates. External expenses include: 
 research and development expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and other scientific development services; 

costs of consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses; 

costs related to compliance with quality and regulatory requirements; 

costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring and developing preclinical and clinical trial materials, including expenses associated with our CMOs; and 

payments made under third party licensing agreements. 

Internal expenses include: 
 personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, for employees involved in research and development activities; and 

facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, insurance, and other internal operating costs, and internal manufacturing expenses. 

We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements as prepaid expenses or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. 
 A significant portion of our research and development costs have been external costs, which we track by stage of development, preclinical or clinical. However we do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program specific basis because these costs are deployed across multiple projects and, as such, are not separately classified. 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we continue to identify and develop product candidates, particularly as more of our product candidates move into clinical development and later stages of clinical development. 
 The successful development of our product candidates in the future is highly uncertain. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of our product candidates, if approved. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, many of which are outside of our control, including the uncertainty of: 
 the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; 

the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones; 

establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies; 

the number of sites and patients included in the clinical trials; 

the countries in which the clinical trials are conducted; 

per patient trial costs; 

successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation of, clinical trials, as well as drop out or discontinuation rates or complications with donors; 

the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; 

the number of trials required for regulatory approval; 

14 

the timing, receipt and terms of any regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; 

the performance of our current and future collaborators, if any; 

establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 

significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work; 

obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 

maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval. 

Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for employees involved in our executive, finance, corporate, business development and administrative functions, as well as expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit, accounting and tax-related services and other consulting fees, facility-related expenses, which include depreciation costs and other allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance costs, recruiting costs, travel expenses and other general administrative expenses. 
 We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as our business expands and we hire additional personnel to support our continued research and development activities, including our clinical programs. 
 Other Income 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities held in financial institutions.

Research and development expenses were 21.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 5.8 million was due to a decrease in license payments, preclinical expenses, and manufacturing starting materials, offset in part by an increase in clinical trial costs to support our trem-cel and VCAR33 ALLO programs. 
 Research and development expenses were 68.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 73.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 5.5 million was primarily due to a decrease in license payments, preclinical expenses, and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related costs driven by additional headcount to support our clinical and manufacturing activities and an increase in clinical trial costs to support our trem-cel and VCAR33 ALLO programs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.0 million was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and stock-based compensation expense. 
 General and administrative expenses were 21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 2.6 million was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in personnel costs. 
 16 

Other Income 
 Other income decreased by 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income decreased by 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income in both periods was due to decreases in interest earned from our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities as the Company held lower balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have not recognized any revenue and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and have received aggregate net proceeds from financing transactions of approximately 464.4 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 In order to fund our future operations, including our planned clinical trials, on March 14, 2022, we filed a universal shelf registration statement (the Shelf Registration Statement ), to provide for aggregate offerings of up to 350.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants or any combination thereof. As of September 30, 2024, 274.4 million remains available under this Shelf Registration Statement, including 119.7 million reserved for at-the market offerings discussed below. 
 At-the-Market Sales Agreement 
 In December 2022, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated Stifel as the agent (the "Stifel ATM Facility"). Pursuant to the Stifel ATM Facility, we may offer and sell shares of common stock with an aggregate value of up to 125.0 million. We will pay Stifel a commission of up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds of any common stock sold through Stifel. We sold 249,096 shares of our common stock under the Stifel ATM Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 at a weighted-average price per share of 1.64 for aggregate net proceeds of 0.4 million, after deducting commissions. As of September 30, 2024, 119.7 million remained available to be sold under the Stifel ATM Facility. 
 Cash Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our short-term and long-term cash requirements from those disclosed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 62.8 million. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our planned future operations. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional funding or that if we do obtain additional funding, that such funding will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us. 
 Based on our current business plan and current capital resources, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2025. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 We expect our expenses to increase substantially if, and as, we: 
 continue research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including in particular the expenses associated with our clinical trials; 

incur both internal and third party manufacturing costs to support our preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates and, if approved, their commercialization; 

seek to identify and develop additional product candidates; 

make investments in our platform, including the continuing costs of developing and maintaining our internal manufacturing capabilities; 

seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates; 

establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any approved product candidates; 

adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements to applicable marketed products; 

17 

acquire or in-license products, product candidates, or technologies; 

maintain, expand, enforce, defend and protect our intellectual property; 

hire additional clinical, quality control, manufacturing and other scientific personnel; 

add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; 

expand our office, laboratory and manufacturing facility; and 

experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above. 

Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval for any product candidates or generate revenue from the sale of any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for at least several years, if ever. 
 As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the public or private sale of our equity, government or private party grants, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of our equity or convertible debt securities, including through the use of the Stifel ATM Facility, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain additional funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or any commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations. If we raise funds through strategic collaborations or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our platform technology, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from geopolitical tensions and adverse macroeconomic conditions or otherwise. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we cannot predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, and there is no assurance that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities. 
 We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):

Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents 

21,438 

(12,680) 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 75.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a net loss of 86.2 million and net cash used of 2.8 million for operating assets and liabilities, which were offset by non-cash charges of 13.4 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of 8.1 million, non-cash lease expense of 3.8 million and depreciation expense of 2.7 million, offset by 1.1 million of non-cash interest earned on marketable securities. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 76.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a net loss of 91.6 million, offset by non-cash adjustments to operating assets and liabilities of 1.4 million and non-cash charges of 13.9 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of 11.5 million, non-cash lease expense of 3.5 million and depreciation expense of 2.6 million, offset by 3.7 million of non-cash interest earned on marketable securities. 
 18 

The 0.7 million decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses offset by differences in the timing of payments for costs incurred during each respective period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 96.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of proceeds of 107.0 million from the maturity of marketable securities, offset by purchases of 9.9 million of marketable securities and 0.2 million of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was 60.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of proceeds of 120.0 million from the maturity of marketable securities, offset by purchases of 58.4 million of marketable securities and 1.0 million of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Stifel ATM Facility of 0.3 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under the ESPP of 0.1 million, offset by 0.3 million of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. Net cash provided by financing activities was 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Stifel ATM Facility of 4.6 million, and proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases of common stock under the ESPP of 0.2 million, offset by the payment of 0.7 million of issuance costs related to the underwritten public offering under our Shelf Registration Statement and concurrent private placement that closed in December 2022, and 1.2 million of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. 
 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 
 Contractual obligations relate to future minimum lease payments for existing non-cancellable leases primarily relating to corporate office and laboratory real estate, with terms expiring through February 2030. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in contractual obligations and commitments from that described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Other commitments include license and collaboration agreements we have entered into with certain parties. Such arrangements require ongoing payments, including payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, receipt of sublicense income, as well as royalties on commercial sales. Payments under these arrangements are expensed as incurred. 
 We also have agreements with certain vendors for various services, including services related to clinical operations and support, which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience and avoid any and all future obligations to the vendors. Under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. The exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated. We do not include these payments in this summary as they are not fixed and estimable. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 There are no new significant recent accounting pronouncements which may materially impact our financial statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports 
 19 

that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in other litigation or legal proceedings relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 If we fail to satisfy all applicable requirements of Nasdaq and it determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease. 
 To maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share. On August 29, 2024, we received notice from Nasdaq that we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because the closing bid price of our common stock had fallen below 1.00 per share for 31 consecutive days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until February 25, 2025 (the Compliance Date ), to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days before the Compliance Date. 
 If our common stock does not achieve compliance by the Compliance Date, we may be eligible for an additional 180-day period to regain compliance if we apply to transfer the listing of our common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market. To qualify, we would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. 
 There can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the requirements for listing our common stock on Nasdaq. If we are unable to satisfy the Nasdaq criteria for continued listing, our common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of us; (iv) limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; (v) limiting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets; and (vi) impairing our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees. In addition, delisting from Nasdaq may negatively impact our reputation and, consequently, our business.

 100 Cambridgepark Dr, Suite 101 | Cambridge, MA 02140 | vorbio.com 

or interpretation of this letter agreement, your employment with the Company, or the termination of your employment, shall be resolved, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by final, binding and confidential arbitration conducted by JAMS, Inc. JAMS or its successor, under JAMS then applicable rules and procedures appropriate to the relief being sought (available upon request and also currently available at the following web address: (i) https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration and (ii) https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/) at a location closest to where you last worked for the Company or another mutually agreeable location. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if JAMS is unavailable due to location or otherwise, or if the parties mutually agree, then the arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association AAA or its successor, under AAA s then applicable rules and procedures appropriate to the relief being sought (available upon request and also currently available at the following web address: https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/EmploymentRules-Web.pdf), at a location closest to where you last worked for the Company or another mutually agreeable location. You acknowledge that by agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both you and the Company waive the right to resolve any such dispute through a trial by jury or judge. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq., will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement and any arbitration proceedings. This provision shall not be mandatory for any claim or cause of action to the extent applicable law prohibits subjecting such claim or cause of action to mandatory arbitration and such applicable law is not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act or otherwise invalid (collectively, the Excluded Claims ), such as non-individual claims that cannot be waived under applicable law, claims or causes of action alleging sexual harassment or a nonconsensual sexual act or sexual contact, or unemployment or workers compensation claims brought before the applicable state governmental agency. In the event you or the Company intend to bring multiple claims, including one of the Excluded Claims listed above, the Excluded Claims may be filed with a court, while any other claims will remain subject to mandatory arbitration. Nothing herein prevents you from filing and pursuing proceedings before a federal or state governmental agency, although if you choose to pursue a claim following the exhaustion of any applicable administrative remedies, that claim would be subject to this provision. In addition, with the exception of Excluded Claims arising out of 9 U.S.C. 401 et seq., all claims, disputes, or causes of action under this section, whether by you or the Company, must be brought in an individual capacity, and shall not be brought as a plaintiff (or claimant) or class member in any purported class, representative, or collective proceeding, nor joined or consolidated with the claims of any other person or entity. You acknowledge that by agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both you and the Company waive all rights to have any dispute be brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated on a class, representative, or collective action basis . The arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person or entity, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. If a court finds, by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the preceding sentences regarding class, representative, or collective claims or proceedings violate applicable law or are otherwise found unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, the parties agree that any such claim(s) or request(s) for relief be severed from the arbitration and may proceed in a court of law rather than by arbitration. All other claims or requests for relief shall be arbitrated. You will have the right to be represented by legal counsel at any arbitration proceeding. Questions of whether a claim is subject to arbitration and procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on the final disposition are matters for the arbitrator to decide, provided however, that if required by applicable law, a court and not the arbitrator may determine the enforceability of this paragraph with respect to Excluded Claims. The arbitrator shall: (a) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (b) issue a written statement signed by the arbitrator regarding the disposition of each claim and the relief, if any, awarded as to each claim, the reasons for the award, and the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award all relief that you or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law. You and the Company shall equally share all arbitration administrative fees, or such fees shall be paid in such other manner to the extent required by, and in accordance with, applicable law or rules to effectuate your and the Company s agreement to arbitrate. To the extent the arbitration service does not collect or you otherwise do not pay an equal share of all arbitration administrative fees, and the Company pays your share, you acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to recover from you in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction half of the arbitration fees invoiced to the parties (less any amounts you paid to the arbitration service). Each party is responsible for its own attorneys fees, except as may be expressly set forth in your Agreement or as otherwise provided under applicable law. Nothing in this letter agreement is intended to prevent either you or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. Any awards or orders in such arbitrations may be entered and enforced as judgments in the federal and state courts of any competent jurisdiction. 
 
 By signing this letter you are representing that you have full authority to accept this position and perform the duties of the position without conflict with any other obligations and that you are not involved in any situation that might create, or appear to create, a conflict of interest with respect to your loyalty or duties to the Company. You specifically warrant that you are not subject to an employment agreement or restrictive covenant preventing full performance of your duties to the Company. You agree not to bring to the Company or use in the performance of your responsibilities at the Company any materials or documents of a former employer that are not generally available to the public, unless you have obtained express written authorization from the former employer for their possession and use. You also agree to honor all obligations to former employers during your employment with the Company. 
 
 100 Cambridgepark Dr, Suite 101 | Cambridge, MA 02140 | vorbio.com 

This letter, together with the Agreement, forms the complete and exclusive statement of your agreement with the Company concerning the subject matter hereof. The terms in this letter supersede any other representations or agreements made to you by any party, whether oral or written. The terms of this letter cannot be changed (except with respect to those changes expressly reserved to the Company s discretion in this letter) without a written agreement signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. This agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey.
