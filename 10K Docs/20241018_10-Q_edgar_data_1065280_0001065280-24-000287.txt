 The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. 
 The following is provided to update the Company s significant accounting policies previously described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. 
 The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and reclassified into Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into Cost of Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within "Net cash provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 In the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to Interest and other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation. 
 Fair value hedges 
 The Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in Interest and other income (expense), net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the hedging instrument in Interest and other income (expense). The difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in

 (1) A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. 
 Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift cards and other prepaid memberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of September 30, 2024, total deferred revenue was million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The million increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of million as of December 31, 2023 is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to increased memberships and price increases.

 Total content obligations 
 
 Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.

Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.

 The following represents our consolidated performance highlights:

 (1) We discontinued our DVD-by-mail service in September 2023. The discontinuance of our DVD business had an immaterial impact on our operations and financial results. 
 (2) We believe the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership ARM absent foreign currency fluctuations. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on ARM, we calculate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period and exclude the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues. Constant currency percentage change in ARM is calculated as the percentage change between current period constant currency ARM and the prior comparative period ARM. The impact of hedging gains or losses is excluded from both the current and prior periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenues would have been approximately 476 million and 1,177 million higher, respectively, excluding the impact of hedging and had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar. 
 Operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased seven percentage points as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to revenues growing at a faster rate as compared to the growth in cost of revenues and lower general and administrative expenses.

Streaming Revenues 
 We primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of September 30, 2024, pricing on our paid plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of 1 to 33 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of 2 to 8 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations. 
 We also earn revenue from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Interest and other income increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to foreign exchange gains of 24 million, net of the impacts of derivatives and hedging, compared to losses of 41 million for the corresponding period in 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the foreign exchange gains were primarily driven by the non-cash gain of 69 million from the remeasurement of our 5,170 million Senior Notes, net of hedging impacts, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies, partially offset by the non-cash gain from the remeasurement of our 5,170 million Senior Notes of 63 million.

 The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of Change September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments 9,225,987 7,139,488 2,086,499 29 Short-term and long-term debt 15,981,328 14,543,261 1,438,067 10 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments increased 2,086 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to cash provided by operations, issuance of debt, and proceeds from issuance of common stock, partially offset by the repurchase of stock and repayment of debt. 
 Debt, net of debt issuance costs and discounts, increased 1,438 million primarily due to the issuance of debt and remeasurement of our euro-denominated notes, partially offset by the repayment upon maturity of the 400 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750 Senior Notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The amount of principal and interest on our outstanding notes due in the next twelve months is 2,579 million. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts had been borrowed under the 3 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 We anticipate that we may periodically raise additional debt capital. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need, including for the refinancing of upcoming maturities or potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. 
 In March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in September 2023, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional 10 billion, also with no expiration date.

Table of Contents 

 Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 8,696,108 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of 5.3 billion. As of September 30, 2024, 3.1 billion remains available for repurchases. 
 Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, as well as strategic acquisitions and investments. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond. 
 Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the expected timing of those payments are as follows: 
 
 Payments due by Period Contractual obligations (in thousands): Total Next 12 Months Beyond 12 Months Content obligations (1) 
 22,698,295 11,810,836 10,887,459 Debt (2) 
 20,639,869 2,578,818 18,061,051 Operating lease obligations (3) 
 2,912,299 515,614 2,396,685 Total 
 46,250,463 14,905,268 31,345,195 
 
 (1) As of September 30, 2024, content obligations were comprised of 4.5 billion included in Current content liabilities and 1.9 billion of Non-current content liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and 16.3 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition. 
 The material cash requirements above do not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately 1 billion to 4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above. 
 
 (2) Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 
 (3) Operating lease obligations are comprised of operating lease liabilities included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, inclusive of imputed interest. Operating lease obligations also include additional obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not meet the criteria for recognition. See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases.

 Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 329 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily driven by a 686 million or 41 increase in net income, an increase in adjustments for non-cash expenses, and favorable changes in working capital, mainly due to the timing of payments for taxes. These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in payments for content assets. The payments for content assets increased 890 million, from 3,210 million to 4,100 million, or 28 . 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2,165 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to purchases of investments of 1.7 billion, coupled with there being no proceeds from maturities of investments in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to proceeds from maturities of investments of 400 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2,702 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of debt of 1,794 million, coupled with an 800 million decrease in the repurchases of common stock from 2.5 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.7 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 213 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily driven by a 2,373 million or 53 increase in net income, an increase in adjustments for non-cash expenses, and favorable changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in payments for content assets. The payments for content assets increased 2,774 million, from 9,660 million to 12,434 million, or 29 . 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2,153 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to purchases of investments for an aggregate amount of 1.7 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to purchases of investments for an aggregate amount of 505 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, coupled with there being no maturities of investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to maturities of investments of 902 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 103 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of debt of 1,794 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a 412 million increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from 119 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 531 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These cash inflows were partially offset by a 1.8 billion increase in the repurchases of common stock from an aggregate amount of 3.5 billion of repurchases in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, coupled with the repayment upon maturity of the 400 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750 Senior Notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to no repayments of debt in the corresponding period in 2023.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 For financial market risks related to changes in interest rates, reference is made to Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contained in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our exposure to market risk has not changed significantly since December 31, 2023. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 16.1 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56 of revenue and 30 of operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, British pound, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso. 
 Accordingly, volatility in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been approximately 1,177 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar. See Part II, Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency. 
 We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amounts recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately 1.9 billion and 958 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings. 
 We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into Cost of Revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amounts recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately 133 million and 71 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings. 
 We use non-derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. These non-derivative instruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings. 
 We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we began entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. Certain contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and the gains or losses on these derivative instruments are recorded in Interest and other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also designate certain contracts as fair

 value hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on the remeasurement of our foreign-currency denominated debt. The gains or losses on these derivative instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. If an adverse change in exchange rates of 10 was applied to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, income before income taxes would have been approximately 22 million and 516 million lower, respectively, after considering the offsetting impact of the foreign currency exchange contracts and our net investment hedges. The decrease in the hypothetical adverse change in income before taxes from 516 million as of December 31, 2023 to 22 million as of September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by our use of non-derivative and derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to the remeasurement of foreign-currency denominated balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
