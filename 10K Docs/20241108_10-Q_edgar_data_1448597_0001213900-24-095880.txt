Company History and Recent Events 

General Corporate Overview 

The Company is an exploration stage gold company
focused on building a long-term business that delivers stakeholder value through developing the Company s Bullfrog and Reward gold
projects and pursuing accretive merger and acquisition opportunities. We are focused on exploration and advancement of gold exploration
and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or strategic transactions such as joint venture arrangements with
other mining companies or sales of assets for cash and/or other consideration. At present, our Reward Gold Project has mineral reserves
under SK 1300, however, we have not to date made a development decision on the project and have not started preparation of the mineral
reserves for extraction. Our other properties are in the exploration stage, we do not mine, produce or sell any mineral products and we
do not currently generate cash flows from mining operations. 

The Bullfrog Gold Project is located approximately
120 miles north-west of Las Vegas, Nevada and 4 miles west of Beatty, Nevada. The Reward Gold Project is located seven miles from the
Bullfrog Gold Project. The Company owns, controls or has acquired mineral rights on federal patented
and unpatented mining claims in the State of Nevada for the purpose of exploration and potential development of gold, silver, and other
metals. The Company plans to review opportunities and acquire additional mineral properties with current or historic precious and base
metal mineralization with meaningful exploration potential . 

The Company is led by a management team and board
of directors with a proven track record of success in financing, exploring and developing mining assets and delivering shareholder value. 

Recent Development of the Business 

On June 13, 2022,
the Company closed (the Closing on its previously announced membership interest purchase agreement (the Agreement with Waterton Nevada Splitter, LLC Waterton to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests (collectively, the
 CR Interests of CR Reward LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waterton CR Reward ). CR Reward holds the Reward
Project located just seven miles from the Company s Bullfrog Project in Nevada. 

The CR Interests were
acquired for the following consideration: (a) 12,500,000 in cash paid at closing; (b) the issuance of 7,800,000 shares of Augusta Gold
common stock at closing; and (c) 22,126,000 in cash paid on September 14, 2022 (comprising collectively the Second Payment 
and the Deferred Payment ).

Reward Gold Project
Feasibility Study 

On September 30, 2024,
the Company released its feasibility study for its Reward Gold Project in Nye County, Nevada. The report titled Feasibility Technical
Report for the Reward Project Nye County, NV, USA with an effective date of September 3, 2024 and a signing date of September 30,
2024 (the Feasibility Study ), was prepared for the Company by Mark Gorman of Kappes, Cassiday Associates; Thomas Dyer
of RESPEC; Mike Dufresne of APEX Geoscience Ltd.; Timothy D. Scott of Kappes, Cassiday Associates; Mathew Haley of NewFields; James
Cremeens of Knight Pi sold and Co; and Mark Willow of SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc., each of whom is a qualified person under
S-K 1300 and NI 43-101, and is attached as an exhibit to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Mineral Reserve Estimate 

Mr. Thomas L. Dyer, P.E. of RESPEC classifies
reserves in order of increasing confidence into proven and probable categories to be in accordance with the CIM Definition Standards
 For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (2014), which are reasonable for US SEC reporting. Thus, Mr. Dyer considers
the reported mineral reserves to be both NI 43-101 and S-K 1300 compliant. Mineral reserves for the Reward Gold Project were developed
by applying relevant economic criteria to define the economically extractable portions of the resources classified as measured and indicated
resources. CIM standards require that modifying factors be used to convert mineral resources to reserves. Definitions for proven and Probable
Mineral Reserves along with Modifying Factors are in the CIM Definition Standards (2014). 

Mr. Dyer used the block model of measured and
indicated resources provided by APEX and referenced in the Company s prior technical report as the basis to define reserves for
the Reward Gold Project. Mineral reserve definition was undertaken by identifying ultimate pit limits using economic parameters and pit
optimization techniques. The resulting optimized pit shells were used for guidance in pit design to allow access for equipment and personnel.
Mr. Dyer then considered mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social, and governmental
factors for defining the estimated reserves. 

Pit designs are based on geotechnical parameters
provided by Knight Pi sold. The open pit design was completed using three pit phases. Waste Rock Storage Facility WRSF designs include north, south, and southwest waste dumps along with some backfill placed in Phase 1 and Phase 2 pits. The waste dumps and
backfill areas were designed to contain all the waste material associated with Proven and Probable reserves. 

RESPEC used the pit and waste dump designs to
develop a production schedule, which was then used in the financial model prepared by KCA. RESPEC reviewed the cash flow model and believes
it demonstrates that the deposits generate a positive cash flow and are reasonable with respect to statement of reserves for the Project. 

Within the pit designs, Measured Mineral Resources
above the cut-off grade were converted to Proven Mineral Reserves and Indicated Mineral Resources above the cut-off grade were converted
to Probable Mineral Reserves. All Inferred resources inside of the pit were assumed to be waste with respect to contained gold, recoverable
gold and resulting economics. Proven and Probable reserves have been defined for the Project based on a 0.008 oz Au/ton cut-off grade
and are summarized in Table 1-3.

Mining Methods 

The proposed mine plan assumes conventional open pit mining methods and
equipment. Mining operations are assumed to be completed using a contractor. Knight Pi sold is responsible for the geotechnical
evaluations and recommendations for slope design parameters used for the pit. Pit designs include three pit phases to achieve the ultimate
pit; the WRSFs are developed as a north, south, and southwest waste dump storage locations as mining progresses. 

The proposed production schedule used inputs from
the resource block model together with material types, mining locations, WRSF fill locations, stockpiles, crusher target rates, and mining
rates. Mining activities have a total duration of 7.6 years, starting with a consistent ramp up during Phase 1 and then transitions into
Phase 2. During the transition into Phase 3 mining, the mining rate increases as the stripping demands increase. 

Recovery Methods 

Testwork results developed by KCA and others have
indicated that the Reward Mineral Reserve is amenable to heap leaching for the recovery of gold. Based on a Mineral Reserve of 15.1 Mt
and established processing rate of 5,479 tpd of ore, the Project has an estimated mine life of approximately 7.6 years. 

Ore will be mined using standard open pit mining
methods and delivered to the crushing circuit using haul trucks which will dump into a run-of-mine (ROM) stockpile located near the primary
crusher. A front-end loader will feed material to a dump hopper from the ROM stockpile. The ROM ore will be crushed to a final product
size of 80 passing (100 passing using a three-stage closed-circuit crushing plant. The crushing circuit
will operate 7 days/week, 24 hours/day with an overall estimated availability of 75 . 

The crushed product will be stockpiled using a
stacking conveyor and reclaimed by vibrating, electromechanical feeders. Cement or pebble lime will be added to the reclaim material for
agglomeration and pH control. Testwork has shown that agglomeration with cement is not required, but as a precautionary measure, cement
will be added during the first lift to ensure permeability is not compromised. 

Ore will be stacked on the leach pad by retreat
stacking uphill from the toe of the heap. Stacked ore will be leached using a drip irrigation system for solution application. After percolating
through the ore, the gold bearing pregnant leach solution drains by gravity to a pregnant solution tank where it will be collected and
pumped to a set of carbon-in-columns (CICs) where gold will be removed by activated carbon. Loaded carbon will be processed off-site for
the first year of operation until the full recovery plant is completed at the start of year 2 of operation. 

Barren leach solution leaving the carbon columns
will flow to a barren solution tank and will then be pumped to the heap for further leaching. High strength cyanide solution will be injected
into the barren solution to maintain the desired cyanide concentration in the leach solutions. 

An event pond is included to collect contact solution
from storm events. Solution collected will be returned to the process as soon as practical. 

Capital Costs 

Capital costs for the process and general and
administration components were estimated by KCA. Costs for the mining components were provided by RESPEC and heap leach pad and pond costs
by NewFields. The estimated costs are considered to have an accuracy of +/-15 . 

The total Life of Mine (LOM) capital cost for
the Project is US 129.2 million, including US 7.4 million in working capital and initial fills not including reclamation and closure costs
which have been estimated at US 9.4 million. Table 2 presents the capital requirements. A total contingency of US 6.9 million or 12.8 
of the Total Direct Costs is included in this summary.

Mining costs were provided by RESPEC at US 3.33
per ton mined (LOM US 10.92 per ton of ore) and are based on quotes for contract mining with estimated owner s mining costs. 

Process operating costs have been estimated by
KCA from first principles. Labor costs were estimated using project specific staffing, salary and wage and benefit requirements. Unit
consumptions of materials, supplies, power, water and delivered supply costs were also estimated.

including social contributions, land access and water rights. 

The operating costs presented are based upon the
ownership of all process production equipment and site facilities, including the onsite laboratory. The owner will employ and direct all
process operations, maintenance and support personnel for site activities. 

Economic Analysis 

Based on the estimated production parameters,
capital costs, and operating costs, a cash flow model was prepared by KCA for the economic analysis. The project economics were evaluated
using a discounted cash flow (DCF) method, which measures the Net Present Value (NPV) of future cash flow streams. All of the information
used in this evaluation have been taken from work completed by KCA and other consultants working on the project as described in this Report. 

21 

The economic model is based on the following assumptions: 

The
cash flow model is based on the mine production schedule from RESPEC. 

The
period of analysis is 12 years including one year of investment and pre-production, 8 years of ore stacking and production and three
years of reclamation and closure.

QA/QC of Underlying Data 

From 2015 to early 2017, CR Reward LLC completed
a compilation, audit and update of the drill hole database. Drill hole locations, survey data and readily accessible assay certificates
were uploaded into the commercially-available DataShed software package. Assays that did not have assay certificates were retained in
an Excel spreadsheet and combined with the DataShed assays for the assay verification. Lithology, alteration, structure, and quartz vein
data from selected holes were digitized from geologic paper logs in January 2017. These data were also brought into DataShed. The drill
hole database consisting of 348 historical holes was audited, compiled, and verified by CR Reward LLC in 2016 and 2017 based on provided
electronic files, for all historical drilling, and assay certificates. CR Reward LLC completed additional drilling in 2017 and 2018 consisting
of 3,443 meters in 28 core holes. 

The historical gold values at the Project were
validated by comparing the historical analytical certificates (and logs) to the digital assay database. All available downhole surveys
were digitized and utilized to properly plot analytical data down-hole. Drill hole collar data was verified versus geological logs or
survey files with collar elevations checked against a modern lidar survey. Drillholes with questionable data were omitted from the database
and were not used to generate the underlying mineral resource estimate. All of the 2017 and 2018 drill hole data provided by CR Reward
LLC was verified by the appropriate QPs. The results of the validation program indicate that the sample database is of sufficient accuracy
and precision to be used for the generation of the feasibility study results. 

Key Risks 

Risks associated with the project include: 

Risk
is inherent with respect to mining. In the QP s opinion, the primary risk factor for the Mineral Reserves will be the ability to
mine the steeper portions of the Phase 2 pit design. Should the establishment of the high wall crest be unsuccessful, then a portion
of the deeper Mineral Reserves could be at risk. To mitigate this risk the mine operational team must be engaged with the contractor
in sound planning and execution of the access to the upper portion of the Phase 2 high-wall. 

No
other major risk factors have been identified other than typical open pit mining risks of cost escalation and operational efficiencies.
There are no other known environmental, legal, title, taxation, socioeconomic, marketing, political or other relevant factors known to
the QP that would materially affect the estimation of Mineral Reserves that are not discussed in this Report. 

The
project has water rights for Reward. Based on estimated water requirements for the mine, process, and infrastructure, there may be a
short fall of water for the project. Augusta has water rights in the same water basin that are transferrable to Reward. The use of chemicals
such as Mag Chloride or similar dust suppressant chemicals may be required to minimize water requirements for road dust control. 

23 

Experienced
labor may be difficult to hire for the project and there could be high turnover or inexperienced labor being hired for some critical
positions. There may be higher maintenance and operating costs than anticipated to compensate for the inexperienced personnel. 

If
engineering for the permits is delayed or approval times for the permits are longer than anticipated, the stripping and recovery plant
construction planned in Year 1 could be delayed. 

The
price of gold used in the Cash Flow is 1,975 per oz, approximately 500 per oz lower than the spot gold price as of the effective Report
date. It is possible that the market gold price during operation will be lower than 1975 per oz, resulting in lower economic performance.

Note
Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Reward Gold Project) 

In this report, we have
provided information prepared or calculated according to U.S. GAAP, as well as provided certain non-U.S. GAAP prospective financial performance
measures. Because the non-U.S. GAAP performance measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP, they may not be comparable
to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for measures
of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are limitations associated with the use of such non-U.S. GAAP measures. Since
these measures do not incorporate revenues, changes in working capital and non-operating cash costs, they are not necessarily indicative
of potential operating profit or loss, or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

The non-U.S. GAAP measures
associated with All-In sustaining costs AISC ), Cash Operating Costs and Cash Costs, as defined below, and the resulting
AISC per ounce metric are not, and are not intended to be, presentations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These metrics represent costs and
unit-cost measured related to the Reward Project. 

We believe that these metrics
help investors understand the economics of the Reward Project. We present the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures for our Reward Project
in the tables below. Actual U.S. GAAP results may vary from the amounts disclosed. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. 

AISC and Respective Unit
Cost Measure 

AISC consists of Cash Costs
(as described below), plus sustaining capital costs. The sum of these costs is divided by the corresponding payable gold ounces to determine
the per ounce metric stated in the table below. 

Cash Costs consist of
Cash Operating Costs (as described below), plus royalties. 

Cash Costs and AISC are
non-U.S. GAAP metrics developed by the World Gold Council to provide transparency into the costs associated with producing gold and provide
a comparable standard. The Company reports Cash Costs and AISC on a per ounce basis because we believe this metric more completely reflects
mining costs over the life of mine. Similar metrics are widely used in the gold mining industry as comparative benchmarks of performance. 

Cash Operating Costs
is a non-U.S. GAAP metric used by the Company to measure aggregate costs of operations that will generally be within the Company s
direct control. We believe this metric reflects the operating performance potential for the Reward Project for the mining, processing,
administration, and sales functions. Contractual obligations for surface land rights (project royalties) are excluded from this metric.
Cash Operating Costs consist of Reward Project operating costs and refining costs, and exclude royalties. 

Other costs excluded
from Cash Operating Costs, Cash Costs, and AISC include depreciation and amortization, income taxes, government royalties, financing charges,
costs related to business combinations, asset acquisitions other than sustaining capital, and asset dispositions.

Accounting
fees decrease resulted from increase in audit fees offset by additional consulting fees needed for required regulatory filings and planning/projection
activities in 2023. 

Legal
fees and professional fees decreased due to a reduction in corporate activities in 2024. 

Marketing
expenses were lower as 2023 had additional amounts that were used for company and shareholder awareness projects. 

The payroll and corporate expenses result from the Company having an agreement to share office space, equipment, personnel, consultants and various administrative services for the Company s head office located in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Management expects payroll costs to fluctuate based on the personnel and consultants used during the period. 

The Company granted options to officers, directors and employees of the Company pursuant to the terms of the Company s Stock Option Plan. In September 2022 the options were repriced resulting in an increase in share based compensation for that period. Certain stock options were canceled in 2023 and 2024 after termination of an employee resulting in reversal of previous share based compensation expense. The options that were issued in February 2021 were fully vested in February 2024. In addition, the February 2024 Warrants of 97,370 has been calculated on the date of issuance of February 26, 2024, using Black-Scholes valuation technique. In April 2024, 2,800,000 options were granted that vested based on years of service up to three years. In August 2024, 200,000 options were granted that vested based on years of service up to three years. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company continued with development and compliance activities for the Reward and Bullfrog Projects. During the quarter, environmental
baseline studies, compliance reporting, and preparation of a feasibility level technical report for the CR Reward project were advanced. 
Additionally, the authorized extension and realignment of the desert tortoise fence needed for pit development and operations was initiated.

The revaluation of the warrant liability is based on the following
outstanding warrants: 

Issue Date

 C 
 1.80 
 
 January 2023 
 
 January 2026 

3,362,573 
 
 C 
 2.30 

There are an additional 9,400,000 warrants outstanding
which are not warrant liabilities and therefore have no effect on the revaluation of warrant liability (the February 2024 Warrants are
not considered a liability and do not get revalued). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company has no revenue
generating operations from which it can internally generate funds. To date, the Company s ongoing operations have been financed
by the sale of its equity securities by way of public offerings, private placements and the exercise of incentive stock options and share
purchase warrants. The Company believes that it will be able to secure additional private placements and public financing in the future,
although it cannot predict the size or pricing of any such financing. This situation is unlikely to change until such time as the Company
can develop a bankable feasibility study on one of its projects. 

On January 20, 2023,
the Company closed its offering (the Offering of 6,725,147 units Units of the Company at a price of C 1.71
per Unit, including the units issued pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters in the Offering (the
 Underwriters ), for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately C 11,500,000 before deducting Offering expenses. 

In connection with the
closing of the Offering, the Company entered into a Warrant Indenture dated January 20, 2023 (the Warrant Indenture with
Endeavor Trust Corporation, as the warrant agent, pursuant to which the Company issued Warrants to purchase up to a maximum of 3,362,573
Warrant Shares. Each Warrant is exercisable at any time after January 20, 2023, and prior to January 20, 2026. 

As compensation in connection
to the Offering, the Company paid the Underwriters cash compensation equal to 5.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds of the Offering and
issued to the Underwriters 336,257 common stock purchase warrants (the Compensation Warrants ). Each Compensation Warrant
is exercisable for one share of common stock (each, a Compensation Warrant Share for a period of 12 months following the
closing of the Offering at a price of C 1.71 per Compensation Warrant Share. 

Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total
liquidity of 232,000 in cash and cash equivalents. The Company had negative working capital of 32,000,000 and an accumulated deficit
of 38,000,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had negative operating cash flows before changes in working
capital of 4,900,000 and a net loss of 4,800,000. 

As of September
30, 2023, the Company had total liquidity of 1,000,000 in cash and cash equivalents. The Company had negative working capital of 25,000,000
and an accumulated deficit of 31,000,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had negative operating cash flows
before changes in working capital of 6,200,000 and a net income of 9,200,000. 

The Company
expects that it will operate at a loss for the foreseeable future and believes the current cash and cash equivalents and working capital
will be sufficient for it to maintain its currently held properties, fund its planned exploration, and fund its currently anticipated
general and administrative costs for at least the next 12 months from the date of this report. However, the Company does expect that it
will be required to raise additional funds through public or private equity financings in the future to continue in business in the future
past the immediate 12-month period. Should such financing not be available in that timeframe, the Company will be required to reduce its
activities and will not be able to carry out all of its presently planned exploration and, if warranted, development activities on its
currently anticipated scheduling. 

Capital Management 

The Company s objectives when managing capital
are to safeguard the Company s ability to continue as a going concern in order to pursue the development and exploration of its
mineral properties and to maintain a flexible capital structure, which optimizes the costs of capital to an acceptable risk. 

As of September 30, 2024, the capital structure
of the Company consists of 85,929,753 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001. The Company manages the capital structure and adjusts
it in response to changes in economic conditions, its expected funding requirements, and risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
The Company s funding requirements are based on cash forecasts. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company
may issue new debt, new shares and/or consider strategic alliances. Management reviews its capital management approach on a regular basis.
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Contractual obligations and commitments 

The Company has four mineral leases underlying
the Reward property, which require annual advance royalty payments according to the following schedules. These leases are out of the scope
of ASC 842 Leases , and any advance royalty paid is expensed off as exploration expenses. Once in production, each agreement attracts
payment of net smelter royalties as per the following table.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not engage in any activities involving variable interest entities
or off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

Stock based compensation is measured at grant
date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period. We estimate
the fair value of each stock option as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company determines the expected
life based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and post-vesting
forfeitures. The Company uses the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent
remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award. The Company has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock
and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Mineral property exploration costs are expensed
as incurred until such time as economic reserves are quantified. To date, the Company has not established any proven or probable reserves
on its mineral properties. Costs of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as incurred.
The Company has chosen to expense all mineral exploration costs as incurred given that it is still in the exploration stage. Once the
Company has identified proven and probable reserves in its investigation of its properties and upon development of a plan for operating
a mine, it would enter the development stage and capitalize future costs until production is established. When a property reaches the
production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized over the estimated life of the probable-proven reserves. When the Company
has capitalized mineral properties, these properties will be periodically assessed for impairment of value and any diminution in value.
To date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects; therefore, all exploration costs are
being expensed. Costs of property acquisitions are being capitalized, and a required payment of 20,000 was made in 2018 to Mojave Gold
Mining Corporation Mojave as part of the Option to Purchase Agreement Option ).

ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES AND MARKET RISK 

Not Applicable. 

ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. 

Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls
and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and
procedures. 

Our management does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can
be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

With respect to the quarterly period ending September
30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Based upon our evaluation regarding the quarterly period ending September 30, 2024, our management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective in
ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure . 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There have been no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We know of no material, active or pending legal
proceedings against the Company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings
in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material
interest adverse to our interest. 

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS 

There have been no material changes to the risk
factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The
risks described in our Annual Report and as otherwise herein are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not
currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
cash flows, and/or future results. 

ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

None. 

ITEM 3 - DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None 

ITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Pursuant to Section 1503(a)
of the United States Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2011 (the Dodd-Frank Act ),
issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to

related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities under the regulation of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA under the United States Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ).
During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had no U.S. properties subject to regulation by the MSHA under the Mine Act and consequently
no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
