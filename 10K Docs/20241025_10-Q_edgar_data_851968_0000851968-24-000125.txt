 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Certain of the statements in this Form 10-Q, particularly those anticipating future performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies, and similar matters, and those that include the words could, should, believes, anticipates, expects and estimates or similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For those statements, Mohawk Industries, Inc. (the "Company") claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made; however, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements will be accurate because they are based on many assumptions, which involve risks and uncertainties. The following important factors could cause future results to differ from historical experience and our present expectations or projections: changes in economic or industry conditions; competition; inflation and deflation in raw material prices, freight and other input costs; inflation and deflation in consumer markets; currency fluctuations; energy costs and supply; timing and level of capital expenditures; timing and implementation of price increases for the Company s products; impairment charges; identification and consummation of acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all; integration of acquisitions; international operations; introduction of new products; rationalization of operations; tax and tax reform, product and other claims; litigation; geopolitical conflicts; regulatory and political changes in the jurisdictions in which the Company does business; and other risks identified in Mohawk s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reports and public announcements.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in this report, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 References to Mohawk, the Company, we, our and us refer to Mohawk Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole, unless the context otherwise requires. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Mohawk is a significant supplier of every major flooring category with manufacturing operations in 19 nations and sales in approximately 170 countries. Based on its annual sales, the Company believes it is the world s largest flooring manufacturer. A majority of the Company s long-lived assets are located in the United States and Europe, which are also the Company s primary markets. Additionally, the Company maintains operations in Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia and other parts of the world. The Company is a leading provider of flooring for residential and commercial markets and has earned significant recognition for its innovation in design and performance as well as sustainability. 
 
 During 2022 and 2023, the Company implemented a number of restructuring actions, productivity initiatives and manufacturing enhancements focused on reducing costs to enhance future performance, including certain facility, asset and product rationalizations and workforce reductions. The Company anticipates these projects will deliver annual savings of approximately 150 million, with an estimated cost of approximately 215 million. In 2024, the Company announced further restructuring actions, including additional facility, assets and product rationalizations and workforce reductions to further reduce costs and prepare the business for the future. The Company anticipates these projects will deliver annual savings of approximately 115 million, with an estimated cost of approximately 130 million. Execution timelines will vary by project, with some savings extending into 2026. 
 
 Residential remodeling is the primary sales driver of flooring products and most flooring is replaced before a home is listed for sale or just after a home purchase is completed. Currently, consumers are delaying their discretionary spending habits due to inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors, and this trend continues to impact new home construction and residential renovation and remodeling activity. While the U.S. federal funds rate decreased in September 2024 for the first time since March 2020, housing turnover rates remain suppressed due to elevated home mortgage rates and the "locked-in" effect on homeowners, and consumers continue to face a higher cost of living and postpone large purchases of durable goods such as flooring. The Company has, to some extent, offset the impact of a soft housing market and decreased renovation activity through cost containment, productivity and lower input costs. Due to low housing availability, aging stock and greater household formation, the Company believes demand in its markets will accelerate when interest rates decline. In addition, declining costs in energy and raw materials, coupled with lower industry volumes, have continued to exert pressure on selling prices, although energy prices in certain geographies and materials prices in some product categories remain volatile and may change significantly and unpredictably. 
 
 Due to its global footprint, Mohawk s business is sensitive to geopolitical conflict, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and conflicts in the Middle East. Since the first quarter of 2022, the Company has suspended new investments in Russia in response to ongoing Russian military actions in Ukraine, and the United States, the European Union and other governments have imposed and extended sanctions on Russia as well as on certain individuals and financial institutions, and have proposed the use of broader economic sanctions. Increased restrictions on global trade could result in, among other things, increased volatility in foreign exchange rates and financial markets, supply chain disruptions, and decreased consumer discretionary spending, any of which may adversely affect the Company s business and supply chain. While the Company has had success sourcing alternate suppliers of raw materials to counteract supply chain disruptions, the Company may be negatively impacted by additional supply chain disruption in the future caused by further escalation of geopolitical conflict. In addition, the Company may be impacted by global increases in the cost of natural gas, oil and oil-based raw materials and chemicals. The broader consequences of current ongoing military conflicts, which may include further economic sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; potential retaliatory actions, including nationalization of foreign-owned businesses; increased tensions between the United States and countries in which the Company operates; and the extent of the conflict s effect on the Company s business and results of operations, as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted. In addition, a prolonged and more expansive conflict in the Middle East region could escalate oil and petroleum-based chemical prices as well as lead to the introduction of sanctions or transportation barriers, though the extent of the impact on the Company s business and results of operations, as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.

 Net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 736.9 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 1,032.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. The change was primarily attributable to cash used for inventory and accounts receivable, partially offset by cash provided by higher net earnings and the change in accounts payable. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 293.6 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 730.0 million in the first nine months of 2023.

 Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 651.6 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 273.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. The change was primarily attributable to higher payments of term loan facility of 912.3 million, lower proceeds from Senior Notes of 600.0 million, higher share repurchase of 87.9 million and lower proceeds from Senior Credit Facility of 35.9 million (net of payments), partially offset by the higher proceeds from commercial paper of 1,239.3 million (net of payments). 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Company had cash of 424.0 million, of which 245.6 million was in the United States and 178.4 million was in foreign countries. The Company plans to permanently reinvest the cash held outside the United States. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under its existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, working capital and debt servicing requirements over at least the next twelve months. The Company continually evaluates its projected needs and may conduct additional debt financings, subject to market conditions, to increase its liquidity and to take advantage of attractive financing opportunities. 
 
 On February 10, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 500 million of its common stock (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program ).

 See Note 17, Debt , of the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further discussion of the Company s long-term debt. The Company may continue, from time to time, to retire its outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amount involved may be material.

 Impact of Inflation 
 
 Inflation affects the Company s manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. The Company expects raw material prices, many of which are petroleum-based, to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the Company s production processes. Although the Company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, labor, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. In the past, the Company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations.

 Exhibit 95.1 

 Mine Safety Disclosure 
 
 The following disclosures are provided pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which requires certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). 
 
 Mine Safety Information 
 
 Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the U.S. mining operator must abate the alleged violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, may be reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine as well as by the MSHA inspector(s) assigned. 
 
 The following table includes information required by the Act for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Mine (Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) ID) Total # of Significant & Substantial violations under 104(a) Total # of orders under 104(b) Total # of unwarrantable failure citations and orders under 104(d) Total # of violations under 110(b)(2) Total # of orders under 107(a) Total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA in thousands) Total # of mining related fatalities Received Notice of Pattern of Violations under 104(e) (yes no) Received Notice of Potential to have Pattern under 104(e) (yes no) Total # of Legal Actions Pending with the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission as of the Last Day of Period Legal Actions Initiated or Resolved During Period TP Claims 1 Rosa Blanca (4100867) 1 0 No No
