NOTE 1. 
 million and million, respectively, and working capital of million and million, respectively. Management believes that the Company has sufficient cash to continue operating activities for beyond 12 months from issuance of these condensed financial statements. 
 Future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including the timing and extent of spending on research and development and market acceptance of the Company s products, if approved for commercial sale. The Company expects that it will need to obtain additional financing to complete clinical trials and launch and commercialize any product candidates for which it receives regulatory approval. Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, the Company expects to finance its operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. There can be no assurance that any such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. To the extent that the Company raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of its stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting the Company s ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If the Company is unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, its business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. The Company may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its product discovery and development activities or future commercialization efforts. 
 The Company completed its INTERCEPT-AD clinical trial in the second quarter of 2023. This trial enrolled patients and participants received at least one dose of study drug. INTERCEPT-AD was a U.S.-based, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with overlapping single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose cohorts evaluating patients with early AD. In July 2023, the Company announced topline results from INTERCEPT-AD, which demonstrated that sabirnetug met the primary and secondary objectives of this study in participants with early AD. 
 The Company announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 2 ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial in May 2024, and expects to complete enrollment in the first half of 2025.

 The carrying values reported in the Company s condensed balance sheets for cash (excluding cash equivalents, which are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis), restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued clinical trial expenses and accrued expenses and other current liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values due to the short-term nature of these items. 
 The carrying amount of the Company s long-term debt approximates fair value due to its variable market interest rate and management s opinion that current rates and terms that would be available to the Company with the same maturity and security structure would be essentially equivalent to that of the Company s long-term debt. Certain features of the Company s term loan facility (the Term Loan were determined to be embedded derivatives requiring separate measurement from the loan host instrument. For additional information regarding the Term Loan, see Note 6. Debt . 
 The fair value of the Company s money market funds is determined using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets.

The remaining million is available for borrowing upon the Company s request based on review of certain information and discretionary approval from the lenders. The Loan Agreement bears interest per annum at the greater of (i) or (ii) the sum of the prime rate last quoted in The Wall Street Journal plus for such interest period and the principal amount of the Term Loan outstanding under the Loan Agreement. The Term Loan matures on November 1, 2027, and can be extended to November 1, 2028 if the Company achieves certain financing milestones. The Loan Agreement provides for a final payment fee of an additional million (the Final Payment due upon repayment of the Term Loan. 
 The principal and interest of the Term Loan are to be repaid in equal monthly installments beginning on July 1, 2026 through the maturity of the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement allows prepayment of the entire Term Loan or a portion of the Term Loan of more than million, provided that any partial prepayment will leave outstanding borrowings of at least million. 
 The lenders can elect to convert up to million of the Term Loan (the Conversion Amount into the Company s common stock at a conversion price of (the Conversion Option ). If the lenders elect to convert the Conversion Amount upon the Next Qualified Financing, as defined in the Loan Agreement, whereby the Company receives aggregate gross proceeds of at least million, the conversion price will equal the lowest effective cash price per share of securities issued in such Qualified Financing (the Share-Settled Redemption ). The Conversion Option and Share-Settled Redemption within the Loan Agreement are required to be bifurcated as a single compound embedded derivative (the Embedded Derivatives at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 In accordance with the Loan Agreement, the Company issued an equity-classified warrant to purchase shares of common stock (the Loan Warrant ), with an initial allocated fair value of million. See additional discussion in Note 8. Stockholders Equity. 
 The initial recognition of the direct fees of million, the Final Payment of million, the initial fair value of the Embedded Derivatives of million and the fair value of the Loan Warrant of million for the Loan Agreement resulted in a discount of million, which is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Loan Agreement using the effective interest method.

 The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was per share and per share, respectively. 
 Stock options granted after December 31, 2017 generally vest monthly over a range of to months or vest monthly over a total of months following a cliff and all have a contractual term. Beginning in 2022, the Company has also issued annual option awards to its Board that vest in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Stock options granted prior to December 31, 2017 were either fully vested upon grant or generally vested monthly over a range of three to months and also have a term. The Company s common stock became publicly traded in July 2021 and lacks sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, the Company estimates expected stock volatility using a weighted average blend of historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies, as well as its own historical volatility. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected term of the Company s stock options has been determined using the simplified method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel disease-modifying approach to target what we believe to be a key underlying cause of Alzheimer s disease, or AD. Alzheimer s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the brain that leads to loss of memory and cognitive functions and ultimately results in death. Our scientific founders pioneered research on soluble amyloid-beta oligomers, or A Os, which are globular assemblies of the amyloid-beta, or A , peptide that are distinct from A monomers and amyloid plaques. Based on decades of research and supporting evidence, A Os have gained increasing scientific acceptance as a primary toxin involved in the initiation and propagation of AD pathology. We are currently focused on advancing a targeted immunotherapy drug candidate, sabirnetug (ACU193), in our Phase 2 ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial following the results of INTERCEPT-AD, our Phase 1 clinical trial of sabirnetug in early AD patients (patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer s disease), which were first reported in July 2023. Sabirnetug is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin gamma 2, or IgG2, monoclonal antibody, or mAb, that was designed to selectively target A Os, has demonstrated functional and protective effects in in vitro assays, and has previously demonstrated in vivo safety and pharmacologic activity in multiple animal species, including transgenic mouse models for AD. 
 In July 2023, we announced topline results from our INTERCEPT-AD clinical trial, which demonstrated that sabirnetug met the primary and secondary objectives of the study in 62 participants with early AD. Sabirnetug was well-tolerated throughout the single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts, with an overall rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA-E, of 10.4 . The incidence of ARIA-E was dose dependent, with a rate of 7 for patients given 10 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg and 21 for patients given 60 mg/kg. An analysis of change in amyloid plaque load, as measured in Centiloids by positron emission tomography, or PET, demonstrated a rapid, dose-related mean decrease at the higher dose levels studied. Statistically significant, dose-related central target engagement was observed as measured by sabirnetug-A O complex, establishing the first target engagement assay developed that is specific to an A O-targeting antibody. The study also demonstrated near maximal target engagement for patients receiving 25 mg/kg every two weeks or 60 mg/kg every four weeks, an important finding for dose selection in the ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial. In November 2023, we announced a number of downstream biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, specific to amyloid and tau pathology and synaptic injury showed improvement in the INTERCEPT-AD MAD cohorts, further supporting a drug effect of sabirnetug on Alzheimer s pathology. These included effects of sabirnetug on p-tau181, which reflects damage to neurons and is known to be elevated in CSF of patients with AD, and effects of sabirnetug on neurogranin and VAMP2, markers which reflect damage to neuronal synapses and are elevated in CSF of patients with AD. 
 We announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 2 ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial in May 2024, and we expect to complete enrollment in the first half of 2025. ALTITUDE-AD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm study designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of sabirnetug with approximately 180 participants per arm for a total of approximately 540 participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD. We intend to use the Integrated Alzheimer s Disease Rating Scale, or iADRS, at 18 months as the primary outcome measure. Our planned doses for ALTITUDE-AD are 35 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, both dosed every four weeks, or Q4W. These dose levels and frequency were selected based on extensive pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamic, or PD, modeling of our Phase 1 data. Based on regulatory feedback from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and to enhance the probability that the EMA will consider ALTITUDE-AD as a registration-eligible study for sabirnetug, we have amended the ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial protocol from a Phase 2/3 study to a Phase 2 standalone study. 
 We were incorporated in 1996 and were party to an exclusive license and research collaboration with Merck Co., Inc., or Merck, in 2003. Although we acquired the exclusive rights to sabirnetug from Merck in 2011 following Merck s strategic decision to focus its AD development efforts on a different product candidate, we did not recommence meaningful

 operations until we completed our first institutional fundraising in 2018. Since 2018, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, conducting discovery, research and development activities, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of our convertible preferred stock and common stock, the issuance of notes, entry into a term loan facility, grant revenue and, during our collaboration with Merck, certain payments received under our collaboration agreement. 
 In November 2023, we announced a global collaboration and license agreement with Halozyme, Inc., or Halozyme, to develop a subcutaneous formulation of sabirnetug. In July 2024, we announced that the first subject had been dosed with a subcutaneous formulation of sabirnetug in a Phase 1 PK comparison clinical trial. The clinical trial plans to compare the PK between subcutaneous and intravenous administrations of sabirnetug in healthy volunteers. Topline results from this study are expected in the first quarter of 2025. 
 In November 2023, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with K2 HealthVentures LLC, or, together with its affiliates, K2HV. The Loan Agreement provides us with a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to 50 million, of which we have borrowed 30 million in the first tranche and which was funded upon closing. The remaining 20 million is available for borrowing upon our request, subject to review by the lenders of certain information from us and discretionary approval by the lenders. The term loan facility matures on November 1, 2027 and can be extended to November 1, 2028, subject to our achievement of certain financing milestones. In accordance with the Loan Agreement, we issued to K2HV a warrant to purchase up to 730,769 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 1.95 per share. 
 In January 2024, we issued 2,068,246 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market offering program, or ATM, for net proceeds of 7.9 million, or 3.84 per share. 
 We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. Our net losses were 65.2 million and 35.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Approximately 59.2 million, or 91 , of the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to research and development spending. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 288.0 million and working capital of 187.7 million. Our net losses and cash flows from operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of nonclinical studies, clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we advance sabirnetug in clinical trials, seek to expand our product candidate portfolio through developing additional product candidates, grow our clinical, regulatory and quality capabilities, and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. It is likely that we will seek third-party collaborators for the future commercialization of sabirnetug or any other product candidate that is approved for marketing, sales, manufacturing and distribution. We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. 
 As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, global economic conditions may impact our ability to raise additional funds, and we may be impacted by disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide, fluctuations in inflation and supply disruptions, the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas and related sanctions, and otherwise. If these conditions persist and deepen, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, or our liquidity could otherwise be impacted. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs and/or future commercialization efforts. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when needed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 258.9 million, which amount includes the first tranche of 30.0 million that we received under the Loan Agreement with K2HV. Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to fund our oper ating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first half of 2027. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than

 we expect, including based on our decision to initiate other clinical trials or programs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development costs primarily consist of direct costs associated with consultants and materials, biologic storage, third-party contract research organization, or CRO, costs and contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, expenses, and salaries and other personnel-related expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. More specifically, these costs include: 
 costs of funding research performed by third parties that conduct research and development and nonclinical and clinical activities on our behalf; 
 costs of manufacturing drug supply and drug product; 
 costs of conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates; 
 consulting and professional fees related to research and development activities, including stock-based compensation to non-employees; 
 costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our research and development personnel. 
 As we currently only have one product candidate, sabirnetug, in development, we do not separately track expenses by program. Further, we have historically relied primarily on consultants for research and development activities; our internal research and development personnel costs currently represent approximately 18 of our total research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses increased substantially since initiating the clinical trial program for sabirnetug in 2021. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially in connection with our continued clinical development activities for sabirnetug. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation costs, as well as business insurance, management and business consultants and other related costs. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, accounting, auditing, taxes, patent services, investor and public relations, board of directors expenses, information technology, franchise taxes, rent, travel expenses and subscriptions. 
 We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as our organization and headcount needed in the future grow to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidate. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, attorneys and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of additional personnel, accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) primarily includes interest income, interest expense, change in fair value of embedded derivatives and other income (expense), net. The interest income earned, as well as amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts, related to our investments in marketable securities are recorded in interest income. Interest expense primarily includes interest due under the Loan Agreement, as well as the amortization of the related debt discount. The change in fair value of embedded derivatives relates to the embedded derivatives that were bifurcated from the term loan borrowed under the Loan Agreement, accounted for as a derivative at fair value and remeasured at each reporting period for the term of the

 loan. Other income (expense), net, generally consists of fees incurred on our investments in marketable securities and losses on transactions in foreign currencies, partially offset by either realized gains on marketable securities or sublease income.

 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 27.2 million and 11.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 16.0 million increase was primarily due to a 13.4 million increase in costs associated with our Phase 2 ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial, for which we announced the dosing of the first patient in May 2024. Additionally, we incurred a 3.1 million increase in license expenses, 1.5 million for higher personnel costs, which included a 0.4 million increase for non-cash stock compensation expenses, as well as an increase of 0.4 million for shipping and packaging of our drug products. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 1.4 million for manufacturing and materials costs and 1.0 million for other contract research expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 5.0 million and 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 0.1 million increa se was primarily due to an increase of 0.5 million in personnel expenses, including a 0.3 million increase for non-cash stock compensation expenses, partially offset by decreases of 0.2 million for legal expenses and 0.2 million for consulting expenses. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income was 2.5 million and 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 0.6 million decrease was due to an increase in interest expense of 1.0 million related to our borrowings of 30.0 million upon the closing of our Loan Agreement in November 2023, which was partially offset by a 0.4 million increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates and increased investment in marketable securities following our July 2023 underwritten public offering, or the Offering, which raised net proceeds of 121.9 million.

 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 59.2 million and 29.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 30.2 million increase in research and development expenses was prim arily due to a 20.9 million increase in costs associated with our Phase 2 ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial, for which we announced the dosing of the first patient in May 2024. Additionally, we incurred a 4.6 million increase in license expenses, 4.1 million for higher personnel costs, which included a 1.2 million increase for non-cash stock compensation expenses, as well as increases in the following: 0.9 million for shipping and packaging of our drug products, 0.8 million related to services provided by research and development contractors and consultants and 0.4 million for conferences and travel expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 1.3 million for manufacturing and materials costs and 0.2 million for other contract research expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 15.2 million and 13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 1.6 million increase was primarily due to an increase of 2.1 million in personnel costs, including a 1.5 million increase for non-cash stock compensation expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease of 0.5 million for consulting expenses. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income was 9.2 million and 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2.4 million increase was primarily attributable to a 4.5 million increase in interest income on our portfolio of marketable securities due to both higher interest rates and increased investment in marketable securities following the completion of the Offering, which raised net proceeds of 121.9 million, and our borrowings of 30.0 million upon the closing of our Loan Agreement in November 2023, as well as increased income of 1.0 million due to a decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivatives that are bifurcated from the term loan under the Loan Agreement. The increased income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 3.0 million related to our Loan Agreement.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred net losses since inception. We have not generated any revenue from product sales or any other sources other than grant revenue and have incurred significant operating losses. We have not yet commercialized any products and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any drug candidates for at least several years, if ever. 
 Our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sale and issuance of our common stock and convertible preferred stock, the issuance of notes, grant revenue and, during our collaboration with Merck, which was in place from 2003 to 2011, certain payments received under our collaboration agreement. 
 On March 27, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or the 2024 Registration Statement. Pursuant to the 2024 Registration Statement, we may offer and sell securities having an aggregate public offering price of up to 200.0 million. 
 We have a sales agreement, or, as amended, the Sales Agreement, with BofA Securities, Inc., Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated and BTIG, LLC as sales agents, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock for an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million under an at-the-market offering program, or ATM, which is included in the 200.0 million of securities that were registered for sale pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 filed in 2022. Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, we will pay the sales agents a commission rate of up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of our common stock. We are not obligated to make any sales of shares of our common stock under the ATM. 
 In January 2024, we issued 2,068,246 shares of common stock under the ATM for net proceeds of 7.9 million, or 3.84 per share. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 258.9 million, which amount includes the first tranche of 30.0 million that we received under the Loan Agreement with K2HV. Our available-for-sale marketable securities mature within two years. Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first half of 2027. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect, including based on our decision to initiate other clinical trials or programs. 
 We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs and CMOs for clinical trials, nonclinical research studies and testing, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are generally cancellable by us after giving a certain amount of notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred up to the date of cancellation. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (59,000) (34,750) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 18,364 (122,864) Net cash provided by financing activities 6,937 122,619 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (33,699) (34,995) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased by 24.2 million to 59.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 34.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason for this was an increase in net loss of 29.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. When adjusted for increases in non-cash expenses including stock-based compensation of 2.8 million, non-cash interest of 0.8 million and other non-cash expense of 0.2 million, which were offset by increases in non-cash income for amortization and accretion on marketable securities of 3.3 million and change in fair value of embedded derivatives of 1.0 million, our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was responsible for a 29.8 million increase in cash used as compared to the nine months ended 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 September 30, 2023. Working capital changes offset the adjusted net loss, providing 5.6 million of cash for operating activities, which included an increase in cash provided by accrued clinical trial expenses of 9.3 million due to our Phase 2 ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial, as well as an increase in accounts payable of 1.3 million. These increases were partially offset by increases in cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets of 3.8 million and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 1.2 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 18.4 million increased by 141.2 million from cash used in investing activities of 122.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 118.0 million, net of purc hases of marketable securities of 23.2 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 6.9 million decreased by 115.7 million from cash provided by financing activities of 122.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to net proceeds of 122.3 million from the Offering during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 7.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our ATM during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used cash of 0.7 million as payment under a finance lease agreement for certain computer equipment for our Phase 2 ALTITUDE-AD clinical trial. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our research and development, conduct clinical trials and seek marketing approval for our current and any of our future product candidates. It is likely that we will seek third-party collaborators for the future commercialization of sabirnetug or any other product candidate that is approved for marketing. Should we seek to commercialize our products at our own expense, we would incur significant additional expenses for marketing, sales, manufacturing and distribution, which costs we may seek to offset through entry into collaboration agreements with third parties. As a result, we expect that we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our future operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts. 
 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first half of 2027. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect, including based on our decision to initiate other clinical trials or programs. In addition, changing circumstances may cause us to increase our spending significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. We may need to raise additional funds sooner than anticipated if we choose to expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate. 
 The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including but not limited to: 
 the progress, costs, timing and results of ALTITUDE-AD and other potential clinical trials of sabirnetug, including for potential additional indications that we may pursue beyond AD; 
 the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for clinical trials and nonclinical studies and other work, for review and approval of sabirnetug for AD; 
 the outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA, EMA and any other regulatory approvals; 
 the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue; 
 our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of our product candidates from our third-party manufacturers; 
 our need to expand our research and development activities; 
 the costs associated with securing and establishing commercialization capabilities if we were to elect to commercialize one or more products on our own; 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 the economics and other terms, timing of and success of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter for the commercialization of our products; 
 the costs and other terms, timing and success, of acquiring, in-licensing or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies; 
 our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights; 
 our need and ability to retain management and hire scientific and clinical personnel; 
 the effect of competing drugs and product candidates and other market developments; and 
 our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems. 
 Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any such funding may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations or other restrictions that may affect our business. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us. Any funds we raise may not be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. Further, our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide. Additionally, escalation in interest rates, in conjunction with banking failures, may lead to financial institutions being more prudent with capital deployment and tightening lending. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on a timely basis, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 A description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please read the unaudited condensed financial statements in conjunction with our audited financial statements and accompanying notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates are more fully described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates in our Annual Report and in Note 2 to our audited financial statements contained in our Annual Report. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which delays the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, as an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 
 an exception from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; 
 reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; 
 exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 
 an exemption from compliance with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on financial statements. 
 We may take advantage of these provisions until we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We will cease to qualify as an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of: (i) December 31, 2026, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than 1.235 billion in total annual gross revenues, (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30th or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over the prior three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. We have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than you might obtain from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either: (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not applicable to a smaller reporting company. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was: (a) reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and regulations, and (b) communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not subject to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business.
