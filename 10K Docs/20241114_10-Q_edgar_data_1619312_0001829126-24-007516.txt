Business and Structure 

Lightstone REIT IV is a Maryland corporation, formed on September 9, 2014, which elected to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2016. 

Lightstone REIT IV, together with its subsidiaries is collectively referred to as the Company and the use of we, our, us or similar pronouns refers to Lightstone REIT IV or the Company as required by the context in which any such pronoun is used. 

We have and currently expect to continue to seek opportunities to invest in real estate and real estate-related investments. Our real estate investments may include operating properties and development projects and our real estate-related investment may include mezzanine loans, mortgage loans, bridge loans and preferred equity interests, with a focus on development-related investments, including investments intended to finance development or redevelopment opportunities. We may also invest in debt and derivative securities related to real estate assets. A portion of our investments may be secured by or related to properties or entities advised by, or wholly or partially, directly or indirectly owned by (i) The Lightstone Group, LLC (the Sponsor ), which served as our sponsor during our initial public offering (the Offering ), which terminated on March 31, 2017, (ii) its affiliates and/or (iii) other real estate investment programs it sponsors. Although we expect that most of our investments will be of these various types, we may also make other investments. In fact, we may invest in whatever types of investments that we believe are in our best interests. 

We have one operating segment. As of September 30, 2024, we majority owned and consolidated the operating results of Bedford Avenue Holdings LLC (the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture ), a joint venture in which we have a 75 membership interest, and held an unconsolidated approximate 33.3 membership interest in 40 East End Ave. Pref Member LLC (the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture ). We account for our unconsolidated membership interest in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting. 

The Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture owns a 216-room branded hotel (the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel located in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City, which it developed, constructed and opened on March 7, 2023. Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, Inc. Lightstone REIT III ), a REIT also sponsored by the Sponsor and a related party, owns the other 25 membership interest in the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture, which is accounted for as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements. 

16 

The 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture, through affiliates, developed and constructed a luxury residential 29-unit condominium project located at the corner of 81st Street and East End Avenue in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Through September 30, 2024, 25 of the 29 condominium units have been sold and the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture owns the remaining four unsold units which are referred to as the 40 East End Avenue Project. Various affiliated entities majority-owned and/or controlled by David Lichtenstein, who majority owns and controls the Sponsor, own the other approximate 66.7 membership in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture. 

Our advisor is Lightstone Real Estate Income LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Advisor ). Both the Sponsor and the Advisor are majority owned by David Lichtenstein. On September 12, 2014, the Advisor contributed 200,000 to Lightstone REIT IV in exchange for 20,000 shares of common stock Common Shares at 10.00 per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also owns 222,222 Common Shares which were issued on June 15, 2015 for 2.0 million, or 9.00 per share. Subject to the oversight of our board of directors (the Board of Directors and pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement, the Advisor has the primary responsibility for making investment decisions on our behalf and managing our day-to-day operations. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT IV. 

We have no employees. We are dependent on the Advisor and certain affiliates of our Sponsor for performing a full range of services that are essential to us, including asset management, property management (excluding our hospitality property, which is managed by unrelated third party property managers) and acquisition, disposition and financing activities, and other general administrative responsibilities; such as tax, accounting, legal, information technology and investor relations services. If the Advisor and certain affiliates of our Sponsor are unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide the services ourselves or obtain the services from other parties. 

Our Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. We may seek to list our Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of our independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not intend to list our shares at this time. We do not anticipate that there would be any active market for our Common Shares until they are listed for trading. 

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries 

Noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries represents Lightstone REIT III s 25 share of the equity in the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture. Income and losses attributable to the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture are allocated to the noncontrolling interest holder based on its ownership percentage. 

Related Parties 

Our Sponsor, Advisor and their affiliates are related parties of ours as well as other public REITs also sponsored and/or advised by these entities. Pursuant to the terms of various agreements, certain of these entities are entitled to compensation and reimbursement of costs incurred for services related to the investment, development, management and disposition of our assets. The compensation is generally based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements. 

Subordinated Advances Related Party 

On March 18, 2016, we and the Sponsor entered into a subordinated unsecured loan agreement (the Subordinated Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Sponsor made aggregate principal advances of 12.6 million to us through March 31, 2017 (the termination date of the Offering). The outstanding principal advances bear interest at a rate of 1.48 , but no interest or principal is due and payable to the Sponsor until holders of our Common Shares have received liquidation distributions equal to their respective net investments (defined as 10.00 per Common Share) plus a cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return of 8.0 on their respective net investments. 

In the event of our liquidation, the distribution of any available net proceeds initially will be made to holders of our Common Shares until they have received liquidation distributions equal to their respective net investments plus a cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return of 8.0 on their respective net investment. Thereafter, only if additional liquidating distributions are available, we will be obligated to repay the outstanding principal advances and related accrued interest to the Sponsor. In the event that any additional liquidation distributions are still available, 85 of the aggregate will be payable to the holders of our Common Shares and the remaining 15 to the Sponsor. 

17 

The outstanding principal advances and the related accrued interest are subordinate to all of our obligations as well as to the holders of our Common Shares in an amount equal to the shareholder s net investment plus a cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return of 8.0 and only potentially payable to the Sponsor in connection with our liquidation. 

As a result of the termination of the Offering on March 31, 2017, the Sponsor is no longer obligated to make any additional principal advances to us. However, interest will continue to accrue on the outstanding principal advances and the repayment, if any, of the principal advances and related accrued interest will be made according to the terms of the Subordinated Loan Agreement discussed above. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate outstanding principal advances and related accrued interest were 14.2 million and 14.0 million, respectively, which are classified as Subordinated advances - related party on our consolidated balance sheet. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we accrued 46,994 and 139,960, respectively of interest on the principal advances. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we accrued 47,123 and 139,831, respectively of interest on the principal advances. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash deposited in certain financial institutions in excess of U.S. federally insured levels. We regularly monitor the financial stability of these financial institutions and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash. 

Current Environment 

Our operating results and financial condition are substantially impacted by the overall health of local, U.S. national and global economies and may be influenced by market and other challenges. Additionally, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic and other conditions; including, but not limited to, availability or terms of financings, financial markets volatility and banking failures, political upheaval or uncertainty, natural and man-made disasters, terrorism and acts of war, unfavorable changes in laws and regulations, outbreaks of contagious diseases, cybercrime, loss of key relationships, inflation and recession. 

Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impacts on consumer behavior. Worsening economic conditions, increases in costs due to inflation, higher interest rates, labor and supply chain challenges and other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our future results from operations and our financial condition. 

We are not currently aware of any other material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from our operations, other than those referred to above or throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period. 

Portfolio Summary 

As of September 30, 2024, we majority owned and consolidated the operating results of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture, a joint venture in which we have a 75 membership interest, and held an unconsolidated approximate 33.3 membership interest in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture. We account for our unconsolidated membership interest in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting.

The 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture, through affiliates, developed and constructed a luxury residential 29-unit condominium project located at the corner of 81st Street and East End Avenue in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Through September 30, 2024, 25 of the 29 units in the 40 East End Project have been sold and the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture owns the remaining four unsold units which are referred to as the 40 East End Project. Various affiliated entities majority-owned and/or controlled by David Lichtenstein, who also majority owns and controls the Sponsor, own the other approximate 66.7 membership interest in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture. 

The following information generally applies to our investments in our real estate properties: 

we believe our real estate properties are adequately covered by insurance and suitable for their intended purpose; 

our real estate properties are located in markets where we are subject to competition; and 

depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the applicable improvements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

There were no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to our critical accounting policies as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Results of Operations 

Opening of Williamsburg Moxy Hotel 

On March 7, 2023, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture, which we majority own and consolidate in our financial statements, substantially completed the construction and development of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel located in the Williamsburg neighborhood of the borough of Brooklyn in New York City and it opened for business. However, certain of its food and beverage venues subsequently opened during the second quarter of 2023. 

Accordingly, our consolidated hotel revenues, hotel operating expenses, real estate taxes, pre-opening costs and depreciation and amortization are all attributable to the operations of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel. Because the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel was under development and construction prior to its opening date, it had no operating results before March 7, 2023. 

19 

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 

Consolidated 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same period in 2023, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel experienced increases to its percentage of rooms occupied to 94 from 87 and RevPAR to 280.62 from 244.66 and ADR to 298.72 from 279.93. 

Hotel revenues 

Our hotel revenues are comprised of room revenue and food, beverage and other revenues. Total hotel revenues were 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.7 million for the same period in 2023. Room revenues increased by 0.7 million to 5.6 million for the 2024 period from 4.9 million for the 2023 period and food, beverage and other revenues increased slightly by 0.1 million to 2.9 million for the 2024 period from 2.8 million for the 2023 period. The increase in room revenues was attributable to the higher occupancy, RevPAR and ADR during the 2024 period. 

Hotel operating expenses 

Total hotel operating expenses were 5.6 million and 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Room expenses increased by 0.2 million to 3.3 million during the 2024 period from 3.1 million for the 2023 period and food and beverage costs decreased by 0.8 million to 2.3 million for the 2024 period compared to 3.1 million for the 2023 period. The increase in room expenses was attributable to the higher occupancy during the 2024 period. The decrease in food, beverage and other revenues was attributable to better expense control measures during the 2024 period. 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses decreased slightly by 0.1 million to 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. 

Depreciation and amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense was 0.9 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense was 2.8 million and 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense is attributable to the financings associated with the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel and the outstanding principal advances of 12.6 million (included in Subordinated Advances Related Party on the Consolidated Balance Sheets). 

Loss from investment in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entity 

Our loss from investment in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entity is solely attributable to our ownership interest in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture. The losses from our investment in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture were 0.1 million for both of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We account for our investment in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting. 

Pre-opening costs 

Pre-opening costs generally consist of non-recurring personnel, marketing and other costs. In preparation for the opening of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel, which opened on March 7, 2023, and certain of its food and beverage venues, which opened during the second quarter of 2023, we incurred pre-opening costs of 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

20 

Noncontrolling interests 

The net earnings allocated to noncontrolling interests relates to Lightstone REIT III s 25 membership interest in the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture. 

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 

Consolidated 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same period in 2023, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel experienced increases to the percentage of its rooms occupied to 89 from 82 and RevPAR to 238.22 from 221.98 and a slight decrease in ADR to 268.48 from 269.92. 

Hotel revenues 

Our hotel revenues are comprised of room revenue and food, beverage and other revenue. Total hotel revenues were 21.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.8 million for the same period in 2023. Room revenues increased by 4.1 million to 14.1 million for the 2024 period from 10.0 million for the 2023 period and food, beverage and other revenues increased by 1.4 million to 7.2 million for the 2024 period from 5.8 million for the 2023 period. These increases were primarily attributable to the timing of the opening of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel, which opened on March 7, 2023, and the opening of certain of its food and beverage venues, which opened during the second quarter of 2023. However, the increase in room revenues also reflects the higher occupancy and RevPAR which were partially offset by the slightly lower ADR during the 2024 period. 

Hotel operating expenses 

Total hotel operating expenses were 15.9 million and 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Room expenses increased by 2.6 million to 9.3 million for the 2024 period from 6.7 million for the 2023 period and food and beverage costs decreased by 0.2 million to 6.6 million for the 2024 period from 6.8 million for the 2023 period. The increase in room expenses is primarily attributable to the aforementioned timing of the opening of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel. However, the increase in room expenses also reflects the higher occupancy during the 2024 period. The decrease in food, beverage and other costs was attributable to better expense control measures during the 2024 period. 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses increased by 0.3 million to 1.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in asset management fees related to the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel, which opened on March 7, 2023. 

Depreciation and amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 0.8 million to 2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the timing of the opening of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel, which opened on March 7, 2023, and the opening of certain of its food and beverage venues, which opened during the second quarter of 2023. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense was 9.1 million and 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense is attributable to the financings associated with the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel and the outstanding principal advances of 12.6 million (included in Subordinated Advances Related Party on the Consolidated Balance Sheets). The significant increase in interest expense reflects the cessation of the capitalization of all interest expense associated with the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel when its construction was substantially completed and it opened on March 7, 2023. During 2023 (from January 1, 2023 through March 7, 2023), 2.0 million of interest attributable to the Moxy Construction Loan was capitalized to the carrying value of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel while it was under construction. 

21 

Loss from investment in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entity 

Our loss from investment in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entity is solely attributable to our ownership interest in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture. The losses from our investment in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture were 0.3 million and 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We account for our investment in the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting. 

Pre-opening costs 

Pre-opening costs generally consist of non-recurring personnel, marketing and other costs. In preparation for the opening of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel, which opened on March 7, 2023, and certain of its food and beverage venues, which opened during the second quarter of 2023, we incurred pre-opening costs of 2.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Noncontrolling interests 

The net earnings allocated to noncontrolling interests relates to Lightstone REIT III s 25 membership interest in the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 8.1 million and restricted cash of 3.4 million. We believe that our available cash on hand, cash flows generated from the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel, capital contributions received from Lightstone REIT III for the Williamsburg Moxy Joint Venture, and distributions received from the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture, if any, will be sufficient to satisfy our expected cash requirements for at least twelve months from the date of filing this report, which primarily consist of anticipated operating expenses, scheduled debt service, any necessary capital contributions to the 40 East End Ave. Joint Venture and distributions to our shareholders, if any, required to maintain our qualification as a REIT for the foreseeable future. 

We intend to limit our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings to 75 of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders. Market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings may be less than 75 of aggregate fair market value of all properties. We may also incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less. 

Our charter provides that the aggregate amount of our borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300 of net assets in the absence of a justification showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of our Board of Directors and disclosure to stockholders. Net assets means our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves less our total liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over such 300 of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report to stockholders, along with justification for such excess. Market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate borrowings may be less than 300 of net assets. 

Our future borrowings may consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. Such mortgages may be put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash. In addition, we may acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages. Generally, though not exclusively, we intend to seek to encumber our properties with non-recourse debt. This means that a lender s rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property. However, we may, at our discretion, secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. When we give a guaranty for a property owning entity, we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is not paid by the property owning entity. 

In general the type of future financing executed by us to a large extent will be dictated by the nature of the investment and current market conditions. For long-term real estate investments, it is our intent to finance future acquisitions using long-term fixed rate debt. However there may be certain types of investments and market circumstances which may result in variable rate debt being the more appropriate choice of financing. To the extent floating rate debt is used to finance the purchase of real estate, management will evaluate a number of protections against significant increases in interest rates, including the purchase of interest rate cap instruments. 

22 

We may also obtain lines of credit to be used to acquire real estate and/or real estate related investments. If obtained, these lines of credit will be at prevailing market terms and will be repaid from the sale or refinancing of real estate and/or real estate related investments, working capital and/or permanent financing. The Sponsor and/or its affiliates may guarantee our lines of credit although they are not obligated to do so. We expect that such properties may be purchased by the Sponsor s affiliates on our behalf, in our name, in order to minimize the imposition of a transfer tax upon a transfer of such properties to us. 

We have agreements with the Advisor to pay certain fees, in exchange for services performed by the Advisor and/or its affiliated entities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owed the Advisor and its affiliated entities 541,584 and 463,876, respectively, which is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

The advisory agreement has a one-year term and is renewable for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our Advisor and our independent directors. Payments to our Advisor or its affiliates may include asset acquisition fees and the reimbursement of acquisition-related expenses, development fees and the reimbursement of development-related costs, financing coordination fees, asset management fees or asset management participation, and construction management fees. We may also reimburse our Advisor and its affiliates for actual expenses it incurs for administrative and other services provided for us. Upon the liquidation of our assets, we may pay our Advisor or its affiliates a disposition commission. During the second quarter of 2024, the Advisor agreed to allow us to temporarily defer the payment of asset management fees. 

The following table represents the fees incurred associated with the services provided by our Advisor for the periods indicated:

Future distributions, if any, declared will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors based on their analysis of the Company s performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods.
