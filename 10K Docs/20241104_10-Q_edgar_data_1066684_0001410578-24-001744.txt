 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These statements concern expectations, beliefs, projections, plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology, such as may, will, should, could, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, project, predict, intend, potential or continue or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain such terms. In addition, these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: our need for additional equity and debt capital financing to continue as a going concern, and the sources of such capital; our estimates with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern; our intent with respect to future dividends; matters related to our anticipated funding from Delfin; our beliefs regarding the effects of inflation on our results of operations; the continued forbearance of certain related parties from making demand for payment under certain contractual obligations of, and loans to, the Company; and our estimates with respect to certain accounting and tax matters. 
 These forward-looking statements reflect our current view about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Unless required by law, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-Q or to conform these statements to actual results. We wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. A description of risks that could cause our results to vary appears under the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The most important factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals, and cause the assumptions underlying forward- looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to raise additional and sufficient capital; our ability to continue to receive funding from related parties; and our ability to successfully estimate the impact of certain accounting and tax matters. 
 The following discussion should be read together in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes thereto and the audited financial statements and notes to those statements contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. OVERVIEW theglobe.com, inc. (the Company, theglobe, we or us was incorporated on May 1, 1995 and commenced operations on that date. Originally, we were an online community with registered members and users in the United States and abroad. On September 29, 2008, we consummated the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary, Tralliance Corporation Tralliance ), to Tralliance Registry Management Company, LLC, an entity controlled by Michael S. Egan, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result of and on the effective date of the sale of our Tralliance business, which was our last remaining operating business, we became a shell company, as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, with no material operations or assets. We currently have no material operations or assets. On December 20, 2017, our former Chief Executive Officer and majority stockholder, Mr. Egan entered into the Purchase Agreement with Delfin for the purchase by Delfin of shares owned by Mr. Egan representing approximately 70.9 of our Common Stock.

 As a shell company, our operating expenses have consisted primarily of, and we expect them to continue to consist primarily of, customary public company expenses, including personnel, accounting, financial reporting, legal, audit and other related public company costs. As of September 30, 2024, as reflected in our accompanying condensed balance sheet, our current liabilities exceed our total assets. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; GOING CONCERN We received a report from our independent registered public accountants, relating to our December 31, 2023 audited financial statements, containing an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. As a shell company, our management believes that we will not be able to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund our operations and pay our existing current liabilities. Based upon our current limited cash resources and without the infusion of additional capital and/or the continued forbearance of our creditors, our management does not believe we can operate as a going concern beyond the next twelve months. See Future and Critical Need for Capital section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, our condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 NET REVENUE. Commensurate with the sale of our Tralliance business on September 29, 2008, we became a shell company, and we have not had any material operations since then. As a result, net revenue for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses include only customary public company expenses, including accounting, legal, audit, insurance and other related public company costs. General and administrative expenses totaled approximately 31,000 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to approximately 28,000 for the same quarter of the prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in accounting and legal expenses. RELATED PARTY INTEREST EXPENSE. Related party interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 21,642 compared to 18,995 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase consisted of interest due and payable to Delfin for additional loan amounts. NET LOSS. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 53,000 as compared to a net loss of approximately 47,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.The increase was primarily due to increased related party interest expense. NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 NET REVENUE. Commensurate with the sale of our Tralliance business on September 29, 2008, we became a shell company, and we have not had any material operations since then. As a result, net revenue for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses include only customary public company expenses, including accounting, legal, audit, insurance and other related public company costs. General and administrative expenses totaled approximately 104,000 for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to approximately 92,000 for the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in accounting and legal expenses.

 RELATED PARTY INTEREST EXPENSE. Related party interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 62,733 compared to 55,392 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase consisted of interest due and payable to Delfin as the loan amount has increased. NET LOSS. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 166,000 as compared to a net loss of approximately 147,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss increased due to increased accounting and legal expenses as well as increased related party interest expense. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ITEMS As of September 30, 2024, we had 12,367 in cash as compared to 9,105 as of December 31, 2023. Net cash flows used in operating activities totaled approximately 106,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of 90,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in accounting and legal expenses. Net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 109,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 91,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due an increase in the amount of the Delfin Note due to an increase in accounting and legal expenses. FUTURE AND CRITICAL NEED FOR CAPITAL The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. However, for the reasons described below, our management does not believe that cash on hand and cash flow generated internally by us will be adequate to fund our limited overhead and other cash requirements beyond the next twelve months. These reasons raise significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024, as reflected in our accompanying balance sheet, our current liabilities exceed our total assets. We prefer to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, unless we are successful in raising additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern beyond the next twelve months. Notwithstanding the above, we currently intend to continue operating as a public company and making all the requisite filings under the Exchange Act. In March 2018, the Company executed a promissory note with Delfin for 50,000 (as amended and restated, the Delfin Note ), which was amended and restated several times over the years. In October 2023, the Delfin Note was amended and restated to increase the principal amount under the Delfin Note to 977,000, which was our balance at December 31, 2023. In January 2024, the Delfin Note was amended and restated to increase the principal amount to 1,027,000. In June 2024, the Delfin Note was amended and restated to increase the principal amount to up to 1,056,000. In August 2024, the Delfin Note was amended and restated to increase the principal amount to up to 1,086,000, which is the balance at September 30, 2024. The Delfin Note is used to pay certain accrued expenses, accounts payable and to allow the Company to have working capital. Interest accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 8 per annum, calculated on a 365/66 day year, as applicable. The Delfin Note is due upon demand. It may be prepaid in whole or in any part at any time prior to demand. Management anticipates continued funding from Delfin over the next twelve months as it determines the direction of the Company. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a net working capital deficit of approximately 1,445,000. Such working capital deficit included accrued expenses of approximately 25,000, accounts payable of approximately 2,000 and approximately 1,430,000 in principal and accrued interest owed under the Delfin Note.

 EFFECTS OF INFLATION Management believes that inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations during 2023 or the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and will not for the remainder of 2024. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Management has determined that all recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements or do not apply to the Company s operations. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure (1) that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms, and (2) that this information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in alerting him in a timely manner to material information regarding us that is required to be included in our periodic reports to the SEC. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, and has determined there to be no reportable changes.
