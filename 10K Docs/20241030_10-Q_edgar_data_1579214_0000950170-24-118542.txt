Content revenues primarily consist of advertising sales for digital products and industry publications that complement the event properties, custom content agency revenues and subscription fees for educational and e-learning services. Advertising sales and custom content revenues are recognized in the period in which the custom content and digital products are provided or publications are issued. Subscription fees for educational and e-learning services are billed and collected at the subscription date. Typically, the fees charged are collected after the custom content and digital products are delivered or publications are issued. Commerce revenues primarily consist of software-as-a-service subscription revenue, implementation fees and professional services. Fees associated with implementation are deferred and recognized over the expected customer life, which is . Subscription revenue is generally recognized over the term of the contract. Deferred revenues generally consist of booth space sales, registration fees and sponsorship fees that are invoiced prior to a trade show, as well as upfront payments for software subscription fees, professional services and implementation fees for the Company s subscription software and services. Current deferred revenues were million as of September 30, 2024 and are reported as deferred revenues on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Long-term deferred revenues as of September 30, 2024 were immaterial and are reported as other noncurrent liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Current and long-term deferred revenues as of December 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized revenues of million from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the respective period. The accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances related to cancelled events are classified as cancelled event liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as the total amount represents balances which are expected to be refunded to customers.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company earns upon completion of its performance obligations. For the Company s commerce offerings, the Company may enter into contracts with customers that include multiple performance obligations, which are generally capable of being distinct. Fees associated with implementation and related professional services are deferred and recognized over the expected customer life, which is . Subscription revenue is recognized over the term of the contract. The Company s contracts associated with subscription software and services are generally terms with renewals following the initial three-year term. For the Company s content offerings, revenues are deferred and recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the Company s customers are satisfied. This generally occurs in the period in which the publications are issued. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company earns upon completion of its performance obligations. The Company applies a practical expedient which allows the exclusion of disclosure information regarding remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an expected duration of or less. The Company s performance obligations greater than one year were immaterial as of September 30, 2024.

Contract Balances The Company s contract assets are primarily sales commissions incurred in connection with the Company s subscription software and services, which are expensed over the expected customer relationship period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not have material contract assets. Contract liabilities generally consist of booth space sales, registration fees, sponsorship fees that are collected prior to the trade show or other event and subscription revenue, implementation fees and professional services associated with the Company s subscription software and services. Contract liabilities less than one year from the date of the performance obligation are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenues. Contract liabilities greater than one year from the date of the performance obligation are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent liabilities. The Company s sales commission costs incurred in connection with sales of booth space, registration fees and sponsorship fees at the Company s trade shows and other events and with sales of advertising for publications are short term, as sales typically begin up to prior to the date of the trade shows and other events. The Company expects the period benefited by each commission to be less than , and as a result, the Company expenses sales commissions associated with trade shows, other events and other marketing services as incurred. Sales commissions are reported on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income as selling, general and administrative expense. Accounts Receivable The Company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance based upon applying an expected credit loss rate to receivables based on the historical loss rate from similar higher risk customers adjusted for current conditions, including any specific customer collection issues identified, and forecasts of economic conditions. Delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. The activities in this account, including the current-period provision for expected credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were expenses of million and million, respectively, and the activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , were expenses of million and million, respectively. Account balances written off during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were and million, respectively. Account balances written off during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , were million and million, respectively. 

million included an initial cash payment of million and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million. The acquisition was financed with cash from operations. 

 11 

million were expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income. Revenue and net income generated from the GRC acquisition were not material during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of acquired assets and intangible assets offset by liabilities acquired, and is primarily attributable to the future economic benefits from synergies expected to arise due to certain cost savings, operating efficiencies and other strategic benefits. Substantially all of the goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The primary tasks that are required to be completed to finalize the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired include validation of business level forecasts, customer attrition rates and acquired working capital balances. The contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of GRC consists of a potential payment based on a range of multiples, which are dependent upon the acquisition s compounded average EBITDA growth rate between 2024 and 2027, being applied to their EBITDA growth from 2024 EBITDA. The payment is expected to be settled in the first quarter of 2028. Identified intangible assets associated with GRC included trade name and customer relationship intangible assets of million and million, respectively. The weighted-average amortization period of the trade name intangible assets acquired was years. The weighted-average amortization period of the customer relationship intangible assets acquired was years. There is assumed residual value for the acquired trade name and customer relationship intangible assets.

Purchase price, including working capital adjustment 

Over the Pond Media Glamping Americas In furtherance of the Company s portfolio optimization strategy to expand its footprint in the outdoor industry, particularly focused on a market that combines outdoor adventure with upscale accommodations, the Company executed an asset purchase agreement accounted for as a business combination on August 5, 2024 to acquire all the assets and assume certain liabilities of the business known as Over the Pond Media (collectively known as Glamping Americas ). The total estimated purchase price of million included an initial cash payment of million. Glamping Americas produces the only glamping industry event in the Americas. The acquisition was financed with cash from operations. The preparation of the valuation required the use of certain assumptions and estimates. Estimates included, but were not limited to, future expected cash flows, including projected revenues and expenses, royalty rate and the applicable discount rates. These estimates were based on assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable, however, actual results may differ from these estimates. External acquisition costs of million were expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income. Revenue and net income generated from the Glamping Americas acquisition were not material during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of acquired assets and intangible assets offset by liabilities acquired, and is primarily attributable to the future economic benefits from synergies expected to arise due to certain cost savings, operating efficiencies and other strategic benefits.

 On October 29, 2024, Emerald s board of directors declared a dividend for the quarter ending December 31, 2024 of 0.015 per share payable on November 21, 2024 to holders of record of Emerald s common stock on November 11, 2024. 
 Overview 
 Emerald is a leading operator of business-to-business trade shows principally in the United States. Leveraging our shows as key market-driven platforms, we combine our events with effective industry insights, digital tools, and data-focused solutions to create uniquely rich experiences. Emerald strives to build its customers businesses by creating opportunities that deliver tangible results. 
 All of our trade show franchises typically hold market-leading positions within their respective industry verticals, with significant brand value established over a long period of time. Each of our shows is scheduled to stage at least annually, with certain franchises offering multiple editions per year. As our shows are frequently the largest and most well attended in their respective industry, we are able to attract high-quality attendees, including those who have the authority to make purchasing decisions on the spot or subsequent to the show. The participation of these attendees makes our trade shows must-attend events for our exhibitors, further reinforcing the leading positions of our trade shows within their respective industry verticals. Our attendees use our shows to fulfill procurement needs, source new suppliers, reconnect with existing suppliers, identify trends, learn about new products and network with industry peers, which we believe are factors that make our shows difficult to replace with non-face-to-face events. Our portfolio of trade shows is well-balanced and diversified across both industry sectors and customers. 
 In addition to organizing our trade shows, conferences and other events, we also operate content and content-marketing websites, related digital products, and produce publications, each of which is aligned with a specific sector for which we organize an event. We also offer business-to-business commerce and digital merchandising solutions, serving the needs of manufacturers and retailers, through our Elastic platform. In addition to their respective revenues, these products complement our live events and provide us year-round channels of customer acquisition and development. 
 Reportable Segments 
 As described in Note 15, Segment Information , our business is organized into one reportable segment, consistent with the information provided to our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered the chief operating decision-maker CODM ). The CODM evaluates performance based on the results of our Connections, Content and Commerce business lines (collectively, the three C s ), which represent our three operating segments. The Connections segment is primarily comprised of Emerald s trade shows and other live events. The remaining two operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to be considered reportable segments and are included in the All Other category. In addition, we have a Corporate-Level Activities category consisting of finance, legal, information technology and administrative functions. Prior year disclosures below have been updated to reflect the new reportable segment structure described in Note 15, Segment Information. 
 The following discussion provides additional detailed disclosure for the one reportable segment, the All Other category and the Corporate-Level Activity category: 
 Connections: This segment includes all of Emerald s trade shows and other live events that provide exhibitors opportunities to influence their market, engage with significant buyers, generate incremental sales and expand their brand s awareness in their industry. 
 28 

All Other: This category consists of Emerald s remaining operating segments, which provide diverse media platforms and services and e-commerce software solutions, but are not aggregated with the reportable segment. Each of the operating segments in the All Other category do not meet the criteria to be a separate reportable segment. 
 Corporate-Level Activity: This category consists of Emerald s finance, legal, information technology and administrative functions. 
 Organic Growth Drivers 
 We are primarily focused on generating organic growth by understanding and leveraging the drivers for increased exhibitor and attendee participation at trade shows and providing year-round services that provide incremental value to those customers. Creating new opportunities for exhibitors to influence their market, engage with significant buyers, generate incremental sales and expand their brand s awareness in their industry builds further demand for exhibit space and strengthens the value proposition of a trade show, which generally allows us to modestly increase booth space pricing annually across our portfolio. At the same time, our trade shows provide attendees with the opportunity to enhance their industry connectivity, develop relationships with targeted suppliers and distributors, discover new products, learn about new industry developments, celebrate their industry s achievements and, in certain cases, obtain continuing professional education credits, which we believe increases their propensity to return and, consequently, drives high recurring participation among our exhibitors. By investing in and promoting these tangible and return-on-investment linked outcomes, we believe we will be able to continue to enhance the value proposition for our exhibitors and attendees alike, thereby driving strong demand and premium pricing for exhibit space, sponsorship opportunities and attendee registration. 
 Acquisitions 
 We are also focused on growing our national footprint through the acquisition of high-quality events that are leaders in their specific industry verticals. Since the Onex Acquisition in June 2013, we have completed 29 strategic acquisitions, with purchase prices, excluding the 335.0 million acquisition of George Little Management in 2014, ranging from approximately 1.0 million to approximately 120.0 million, and annual revenues ranging from approximately 1.1 million to approximately 25.6 million. Historically, we have completed acquisitions at earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA purchase multiples that are typically in the mid-to-high single digits. Our acquisitions have historically been structured as asset deals that have resulted in the generation of long-lived tax assets, which in turn have reduced our purchase multiples when incorporating the value of the created tax assets. In the future, we intend to look for acquisitions with similarly attractive valuation multiples. 
 Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business 
 There are a number of existing and developing factors and trends which impact the performance of our business, and the comparability of our results from year to year and from quarter to quarter, including: 
 Market Fragmentation The trade show industry is highly fragmented, with the five largest companies, including Emerald, comprising only 8 of the wider U.S. market according to the International Globex Report 2023. This has afforded us the opportunity to acquire other trade show businesses, a growth opportunity we expect to continue pursuing. These acquisitions may affect our growth trends, impacting the comparability of our financial results on a year-over-year basis. 

Overall Economic Environment and Industry Sector Cyclicality Our results of operations are correlated, in part, with the economic performance of the industry sectors that our trade shows serve, as well as the state of the overall economy, which may be affected by factors such as inflation and supply chain interruption. Overall economic conditions and inflationary pressure may also affect exhibitors or attendees willingness or ability to travel to attend our in-person events. 

Increases in Inflation and Interest Rates Heightened levels of inflation present risk for us in terms of increased labor costs, venue costs and other expenses that may not be able to be passed on to customers through increased pricing. In addition, due to inflationary pressures, continued high interest rates relative to historical low rates may increase our financing and borrowing costs on new and existing debt. 

Lag Time As the majority of our exhibit space is sold during the twelve months prior to each trade show, there is often a timing difference between changes in the economic conditions of an industry sector vertical and their effect on our results of operations. This lag time can result in a counter-cyclical impact on our results of operations. 

29 

Variability in Quarterly Results Our business is seasonal, with trade show revenues typically reaching their highest levels during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year, entirely due to the timing of our trade shows. This seasonality is typical within the trade show industry. However, as a result of outside circumstances, such as cancellations or interruptions resulting from natural or manmade disasters, including severe weather events or outbreaks of communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19), future results may not align with this historical trend. Since event revenue is recognized when a particular event is held, we may also experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue and cash flows based on the movement of annual trade show dates from one quarter to another. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Organic revenue accounts for these quarterly movements and the timing of shows, where applicable and material. 

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenues, Organic revenue, cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily from selling trade show exhibit space to exhibitors on a per square foot basis. Other trade show revenue streams include conferences, sponsorships, ancillary exhibition fees and attendee registration fees. Exhibitors contract for their booth space and sponsorships up to a year in advance of the trade show. Fees are typically invoiced and collected in full prior to the trade show or event. Additionally, we generate revenue through digital media and print publications that complement our trade shows. We also engage third-party sales agents to support our marketing efforts. Other marketing service revenue contracts are invoiced and recognized in the period the advertising services are delivered. Typically, the fees we charge are collected after the publications are issued. 
 We define Organic revenue growth and Organic revenue decline as the growth or decline, respectively, in our revenue from one period to the next, adjusted for the revenue impact of: (i) acquisitions and dispositions, (ii) discontinued events and (iii) material show scheduling adjustments. We disclose changes in Organic revenue because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing Emerald s operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe reflect a true comparison of the trends of the existing event calendar given changes in timing or strategy. Management and our Board of Directors evaluate changes in Organic revenue to understand underlying revenue trends of its events. Organic revenue is not defined under GAAP, and has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include that Organic revenue reflects certain adjustments that we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Organic revenue may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 Organic Revenue 
 Organic revenue is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of performance and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. Organic revenue should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to revenues or other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, Organic revenue is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Organic revenue is revenues. For a reconciliation of Organic revenue to revenues as reported, see Footnote 4 and Footnote 5 to the tables under the headings Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. 
 30 

Other Income 
 We maintain event cancellation insurance to protect against losses due the unavoidable cancellation, postponement, relocation and enforced reduced attendance at events due to certain covered causes, including losses caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes. While these causes included event cancellation caused by the outbreak of communicable diseases, including COVID-19, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Emerald s renewed event cancellation insurance policies beginning with policy year 2022 do not cover losses due to event cancellations caused by the outbreak of communicable diseases, including COVID-19. Our Other Income is primarily comprised of received or confirmed event cancellation insurance claim and insurance litigation settlement proceeds. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Decorating Expenses . We work with general service contractors to both set up communal areas of our trade shows and provide services to our exhibitors, who primarily contract directly with the general service contractors. We will usually select a single general service contractor for an entire show, although it is possible to bid out packages of work within a single show on a piecemeal basis to different task-specific specialists. 

Sponsorship Costs. We often enter into long-term sponsorship agreements with industry trade associations whereby the industry trade association endorses and markets the show to its members in exchange for a percentage of the show s revenue. 

Venue Costs . Venue costs represent rental costs for the venues, usually convention centers or hotels, where we host our trade shows. Given that convention centers are typically owned by local governments who have a vested interest in stimulating business activity in and attracting tourism to their cities, venue costs typically represent a small percentage of our total cost of revenues. 

Costs of Other Marketing Services . Costs of other marketing services represent paper, printing, postage, contributor and other costs related to digital media and print publications. 

Other Event-Related Expenses . Other event-related costs include temporary labor for services such as security, shuttle buses, speaker fees, food and beverage expenses and event cancellation insurance. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Labor Costs . Labor costs represent the cost of employees who are involved in sales, marketing, planning and administrative activities. The actual on-site set-up of the events is contracted out to third-party vendors and is included in cost of revenues. 

Miscellaneous Expenses . Miscellaneous expenses are comprised of a variety of other expenses, including advertising and marketing costs, promotion costs, credit card fees, travel expenses, printing costs, office supplies and office rental expense. Direct trade show costs are recorded in cost of revenues. All other costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense principally represents interest payments and certain other fees paid to lenders under our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as amended, for the portion of the year ended December 31, 2023 after the Term Loan Amendment Effective Date, by the Term Loan Amendment). 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 We have historically grown our business through acquisitions and, in doing so, have acquired significant intangible assets, the value of some of which is amortized over time. These acquired intangible assets, unless determined to be indefinite-lived, are amortized over extended periods of three to thirty years from the date of each acquisition for reporting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP purposes, or fifteen years for tax purposes. This amortization expense reduces our taxable income. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense consists of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes based on income in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 31 

We record deferred tax charges or benefits primarily associated with our utilization or generation of net operating loss carryforwards and book-to-tax differences related to amortization of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, stock-based compensation charges, 163(j) interest expense limitation and deferred financing costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure of our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges and (vi) other items that we believe are not part of our core operations. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. 
 Management and our Board of Directors use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance and believe it is helpful in highlighting trends because it excludes the results of decisions that are outside the control of management, while other performance metrics can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. We reference Adjusted EBITDA frequently in our decision-making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain normal recurring expenses and one-time cash adjustments that we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see Footnote 3 to the tables under the headings Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Flow Model 
 We typically have favorable cash flow characteristics, as described below (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows ), as a result of our high profit margins, low capital expenditures and consistent negative working capital, excluding cash on hand. Our working capital, excluding cash on hand, is negative due to the fact that our current assets are generally lower than our current liabilities. Current assets primarily include accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, while current liabilities primarily include accounts payable and deferred revenues. Cash received prior to an event is recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet and recognized as revenue upon completion of each trade show. The implication of having negative working capital, excluding cash on hand, is that changes in working capital represent a source of cash as our business grows. 
 The primary driver for our negative working capital, excluding cash on hand, is the sales cycle for a trade show, which typically begins during the twelve months prior to a show. In the interim period between the current show and the following show, we continue to sell to new and past exhibitors and collect payments on contracted exhibit space. Our exhibitors pay in full in advance of each trade show, whereas the bulk of direct expenses are paid close to or after the show. Cash deposits start to be received as early as twelve months prior to a show taking place and the balance of booth space fees are typically received in cash one month prior to a show taking place. This highly efficient cash flow model, where cash is received in advance of expenses to be paid, creates a working capital benefit. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 In addition to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP, we present Free Cash Flow because we believe it is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to our management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after capital expenditures, can be used for the repayment of indebtedness, paying of dividends, repurchasing of shares of our common stock and strategic initiatives, including investing in our business and making strategic acquisitions. 
 Free Cash Flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of liquidity and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 32 

The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities, see Footnote 4 to the table under the heading Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023.

(2) Intangible asset impairment charges for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 represent non-cash charges of 6.3 million and zero, respectively, for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets in connection with our interim testing of intangibles for impairment. 

(3) In addition to net income presented in accordance with GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Revenues 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues for the Connections reportable segment increased 0.4 million, or 0.6 , to 62.4 million from 62.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The primary drivers of the increase were 4.2 million from 2024 acquisitions and 4.2 million from scheduling adjustments. These increases were offset by a decrease of 5.0 million from several discontinued events and an organic revenue decline of 3.0 million, or 5.8 , to 48.5 million from 51.5 million for the comparable period in the prior year. 
 Other Income 
 Other income, net, of 2.8 million, related to event cancellation insurance proceeds, was recorded for the Connections reportable segment during the three months ended September 30, 2023. All of the 2.8 million of other income, net, for the Connections reportable segment was received during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenues for the Connections reportable segment decreased 2.9 million, or 12.2 , to 20.9 million from 23.8 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The primary drivers of the decrease were 4.8 million of prior year cost of revenues from discontinued events and a 2.4 million decrease from recurring events. These declines were offset by incremental cost of revenues from acquisitions of 2.6 million and 1.7 million related to scheduling adjustments. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expense for the Connections reportable segment decreased 1.4 million, or 7.2 , to 18.1 million from 19.5 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower salary and benefits expense as well as a decrease in new event launch expense. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense for the Connections reportable segment decreased 2.1 million, or 33.9 , to 4.1 million from 6.2 million for the comparable period in 2023.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expense for the Corporate category increased 1.3 million, or 8.7 , to 16.3 million from 15.0 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 1.9 million decrease in gains from contingent consideration remeasurements. This increase was offset by lower severance and business insurance expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense for the Corporate category increased 0.1 million, or 12.5 , to 0.9 million from 0.8 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase is attributable to higher purchased software amortization expense. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense of 12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.2 million, or 1.7 , from 12.1 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase was attributable to a higher effective interest rate of 10.41 on our outstanding indebtedness for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.35 for the comparable period in the prior year. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income of 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased from 1.6 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the mix of investments held during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable period in the prior year. 
 Benefit from Income Taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a benefit from income taxes of 3.7 million which resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded a benefit from income taxes of 22.3 million and an effective tax rate of 192.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to prior year changes in valuation allowances and the prior year timing of third quarter and full year projected results. 
 Net (Loss) / Income 
 Net loss of 11.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represented a 21.8 million decline from net income of 10.7 million for the comparable period in 2023. The key drivers of the change were lower benefit from income taxes and higher intangible asset impairment charges, offset by lower depreciation and amortization and interest expense, net in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 38 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.7 million from 10.8 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in net loss described above, offset by higher add-backs for other items, including the amount of the intangible asset impairment charge described above.

(4) In addition to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP, we present Free Cash Flow because we believe it is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to our management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after capital expenditures, can be used for the repayment of indebtedness, payment of dividends, repurchases of shares of our common stock and strategic initiatives, including investing in our business and making strategic acquisitions. Free Cash Flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of liquidity and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a benefit from income taxes of 0.9 million which resulted in an effective tax rate of 23.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded a benefit from income taxes of 24.0 million and an effective tax rate of 167.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to prior year changes in valuation allowances and the prior year timing of full year projected results. 
 Net (Loss) / Income 
 Net loss of 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represented a 12.6 million decline from net income of 9.7 million for the comparable period in 2023. The key drivers of the change were lower benefit from income taxes and higher intangible asset impairment charges and higher interest expense, net, offset by improved results from business operations, lower depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 44 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 68.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 6.7 million from 61.9 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the improved results from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 described above. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary liquidity needs are for working capital purposes, including the production of trade shows and other live events, as well as for funding operating and capital expenditures, including acquisitions, and the return of capital to our stockholders in the form of dividends and/or stock repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 410.2 million of borrowings outstanding under the Extended Term Loan Facility and no borrowings outstanding under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 188.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants contained in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 The Company s event cancellation insurance policies for 2023 and 2024 do not cover losses due to event cancellations caused by the outbreak of communicable diseases, including COVID-19. In the event of a future outbreak of communicable disease, including variants or resurgences of COVID-19, forced cancellations or reductions in attendance of our in-person events would negatively impact our financial results and liquidity, and we would not have the benefit of cancellation insurance coverage to mitigate this impact. 
 Based on our available sources of financing, cash from operations and receipt of insurance recoveries, management believes that the Company s current financial resources will be sufficient to fund its liquidity requirements for the next twelve months. We also expect these sources of financing, cash from operations and receipt of insurance recoveries will be sufficient to fund our long-term contractual obligations and capital needs. 
 Share Repurchases 
 On October 5, 2020, our Board authorized and approved a new 20.0 million share repurchase program (the share repurchase program ). 
 On October 26, 2022, our Board approved a further extension and expansion of the share repurchase program, which allowed for the repurchase of 20.0 million of our common stock through December 31, 2023. We settled the repurchase of zero shares and 5,064,140 shares for 16.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, under this repurchase program. 
 On November 3, 2023, our Board approved a further extension and expansion of the share repurchase program, which allows for the repurchase of 25.0 million of our common stock through December 31, 2024, subject to early termination or extension by the Board. We settled the repurchase of 742,939 shares and 1,038,589 shares for 3.6 million and 5.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, under this repurchase program. There was 19.6 million remaining available for share repurchases under the share repurchase program as of September 30, 2024. The share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. 
 On October 29, 2024, our Board approved the extension and expansion of the share repurchase program, which allows for the repurchase of 25.0 million of our Common Stock through December 31, 2025, subject to early termination or extension by the Board. The share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

Mandatory Conversion 
 On April 18, 2024, the Company announced it had delivered a notice informing holders of its redeemable convertible preferred stock that it had exercised its right to mandate that all shares of the redeemable convertible preferred stock be converted to shares of the Company s common stock. The notice was triggered by the fact that the closing share price of the Company s common stock on the NYSE had exceeded 175 of the conversion price for a period of 20 consecutive trading days ending with April 17, 2024. On May 2, 2024 (the Conversion Date ), each holder of redeemable convertible preferred stock received approximately 1.9717 shares of common stock for each share of redeemable convertible preferred stock held as of the Conversion Date. As a result, 71,402,607 shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted into 140,781,525 shares of common stock on the Conversion Date. Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares of common stock. Following the Conversion Date, no redeemable convertible preferred stock was outstanding, and all rights of the former holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock were terminated. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes the changes to our cash flows for the periods presented:

Net cash used in investing activities 

(22.8) 

(18.9) 

Net cash used in financing activities

(44.6) 

Operating Activities 
 Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items that include goodwill and intangible asset impairments, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, amortization of deferred financing fees and debt discount, share-based compensation, plus the effect of changes during the period in our working capital. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.2 million, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 24.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects the 12.6 million change from net income of 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to net loss of 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net (loss) / income plus non-cash items provided operating cash flows of 36.8 million and 55.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities reflects the use of 10.6 million and 30.9 million for working capital in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities generally consist of business acquisitions and purchases of other productive assets, investments in information technology and capital expenditures to furnish or upgrade our offices. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.9 million to 22.8 million from 18.9 million in the comparable period in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 6.7 million associated with acquisition of businesses offset by a 1.8 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and the receipt of 1.0 million working capital receivable related to the acquisition of Hotel Interactive. 
 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities primarily consist of payment of the preferred and common stock dividends, borrowing and repayments on our debt, common stock repurchases and proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with stock option exercises. 
 46 

Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 25.9 million to 18.7 million, compared to 44.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 12.5 million decrease in original issuance discount paid, an 11.5 million decrease in repurchases of common stock, a 3.7 million decrease in contingent consideration payments, a 2.0 million decrease in debt issuance costs and 1.4 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity plan, offset by the payment of 3.1 million with respect to the common stock dividend and the repayment of 2.1 million of principal on the Extended Term Loan Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Free Cash Flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.3 million, to 18.6 million from 15.3 million for the comparable period in the prior year. 
 Free Cash Flow is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. For a discussion of our presentation of Free Cash Flow, see Footnote 4 to the table under the heading Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 There have been no material changes to the contractual obligations as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024, which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov, other than those made in the ordinary course of business. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies, some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates. 
 We believe the application of our accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. Our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
 The policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations. 
 Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 , Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management has discussed the selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with members of our Board of Directors. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies and estimates described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 3. 	 Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities. See Note 7, Debt , in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further description of our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 410.2 million of variable rate term loan borrowings outstanding under our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facilities and no variable rate borrowings outstanding under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility with respect to which we are exposed to interest rate risk. Holding other variables constant and assuming no interest rate hedging, a 0.25 increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate indebtedness would have resulted in a 1.0 million increase in annual interest expense based on the amount of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 Historically, inflation has not had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Beginning in 2021, inflation began to increase. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. While the Company has strategies to manage and offset these pressures, our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, inflation influences interest rates, which in turn impact the fair value of our investments and yields on new investments. Operating expenses, including payroll, are impacted to a certain degree by the inflation rate as well. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for the periods presented. However, recent economic trends have resulted in inflationary conditions, including pressure on wages, and sustained inflationary conditions in future periods could affect our business. 
 Item 4. 	 Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company will be detected. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024 the disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the Company s third fiscal quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 48 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. 	 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be involved in general legal disputes arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently involved in legal proceedings that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Item 1A. 	 Ri sk Factors 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024 is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov, and includes detailed discussions of our risk factors. At the time of this filing, there have been no material changes to the risk factors that were included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Item 2. 	 Unregistered Sale of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In November 2023, our Board of Directors approved an extension and expansion of our previously announced share repurchase program, which allows for the repurchase of 25.0 million of our common stock from time to time through and including December 31, 2024, subject to early termination or extension by the Board of Directors. This approval extends and expands the previously authorized 20.0 million share repurchase program that was effective through December 31, 2023. The share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. There is no minimum number of shares that we are required to repurchase. Shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market, including pursuant to one or more Rule 10b5-1 purchase plans that we may enter into from time to time, or in privately negotiated transactions. Such purchases will be at times and in amounts as we deem appropriate, based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements and other business considerations. 
 The following table presents our purchases of common stock during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, as part of the publicly announced share repurchase program:
