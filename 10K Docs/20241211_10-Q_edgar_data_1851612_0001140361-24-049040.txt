Overview

We are a blank check company incorporated on February 23, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase,
 reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We were initially incorporated under the name BH3 Acquisition Corp., subsequently changed our name to Crixus BH3 Acquisition Company on July 21, 2021 and
 subsequently changed our name to Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Company on November 3, 2023. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement
 Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.

Recent Developments

On December 7, 2022 (following approval by our stockholders at the December 2022 Special Meeting), we effected a charter amendment and an amendment to its Investment Management Trust Agreement with
 Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, the effect of which was to change the Company s prior termination date from April 7, 2023 to August 7, 2023 (as further extended to October 6, 2023 by the Former Sponsor providing the Company
 with the requisite notice and the deposit amount). In connection with the December 2022 Special Meeting, 17,987,408 public shares were tendered for redemption. After giving effect to the First Redemption, we had approximately 51.2 million
 remaining in the trust account.

On September 27, 2023, the Company, the Former Sponsor and the Sponsor entered into the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, the Sponsor (i)
 agreed to purchase an aggregate of 3,746,303 shares of Class B common stock from the Former Sponsor and each of the anchor investors and 4,160,000 Private Placement Warrants from the Former Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of 16,288
 and (ii) will become the Sponsor of the Company. In connection therewith, the Former Sponsor also entered into anchor transfer agreements with each of its anchor investors, whereby each anchor agreed, subject to the conditions contained
 therein, when and as directed by the Former Sponsor, to transfer 2/3 of their shares of Class B common stock for no consideration; provided, however, upon the request of an anchor investor, the Former Sponsor shall pay to them 0.0043 per
 share.

The Purchase Agreement closed as of November 2, 2023. In connection with the closing of the Purchase, the Sponsor, among other things, joined as a party to (i) the Letter Agreement, dated October 4, 2021, by
 and between the Company and the Former Sponsor and (ii) the Registration and Stockholder Rights Agreement, dated October 4, 2021, among the Company, the Former Sponsor and certain security holders party thereto. On November 3, 2023, the
 Company changed its corporate name to Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Company , pursuant to an amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on November 3, 2023.

On October 6, 2023, (following approval by our stockholders at the October 2023 Special Meeting, we effected an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the effect of which was to
 (i) further extend the period of time by which we have to consummate an Initial Business Combination to July 31, 2024 and (ii) provide for the right of a holder of shares of Class B common stock to convert such shares into shares of Class A
 common stock on a one-to-one basis at any time and from time to time at the election of the holder. In connection with the October 2023 Special Meeting, 2,700,563 public shares were tendered for redemption and the Former Sponsor converted
 3,000,000 of its shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock. Upon conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock, such Class A common stock will not be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account
 through redemptions or otherwise and will remain subject to the existing transfer restrictions. Immediately after giving effect to the Second Redemption and the Conversion, on October 24, 2023, we had approximately 24.3 million remaining
 in the Trust Account, and 5,312,029 shares of Class A common stock (including the 3,000,000 converted shares of Class B common stock) and 2,750,000 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding.

In connection with the October 2023 Special Meeting, the Company, the Former Sponsor and the Sponsor entered into non-redemption agreements on substantially the same terms with certain stockholders of the
 Company, pursuant to which such stockholders agreed not to redeem (or to validly rescind any redemption requests on) an aggregate of 1,946,794 shares of Class A common stock in connection with the October 2023 Special Meeting. In exchange
 for the foregoing commitments not to redeem such shares of Class A common stock, the Sponsor agreed to transfer an aggregate of 389,359 shares of common stock held by the Sponsor to such stockholders immediately following consummation of an
 Initial Business Combination.

On November 3, 2023, we entered into the Subscription Agreement with the Sponsor and Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund, an unaffiliated third party, pursuant to which Polar agreed to make certain capital
 contributions to the Company of up to 1,200,000 from time to time, at the request of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Agreement. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Capital Contribution shall be
 repaid to Polar by the Company within five (5) business days of the Company closing an Initial Business Combination. Polar may elect to receive such repayment (i) in cash or (ii) in shares of common stock of the surviving entity in such
 Initial Business Combination at a rate of one share of common stock for each ten dollars 10.00) of the Capital Contribution that is funded. Additionally, in consideration of the Capital Contribution, at the closing of an Initial Business

In 2023, we engaged the services of multiple entities to act as capital market advisors, specifically to advise on market conditions, advise in connection with seeking an extension for completing an Initial
 Business Combination, advise in connection with a possible Initial Business Combination, and acting as a placement agent in connection with a private placement of equity, equity-linked, convertible and/or debt securities or other capital or
 debt raising transaction. No fees are due the advisors until consummation of the Initial Business Combination and are payable at that time in a combination of cash and shares of common stock of the public company entity that survives the
 Initial Business Combination. In accordance with ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 we have recognized a 418,400 liability at fair value for the shares to be issued upon consummation of the Initial

 redeem shares of the Company s Class A common stock.

Convertible Promissory Note

On February 26, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the total principal amount of up to 500,000 (the FI Sponsor Promissory Note to the Sponsor. The FI Sponsor Promissory Note does
 not bear interest and matures upon closing of the Company s Initial Business Combination. In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the FI Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid only from amounts
 remaining outside of the Trust Account. Up to the total principal amount of the FI Sponsor Promissory Note may be converted, in whole or in part, at the option of the lender into warrants of the Company at a price of 1.50 per warrant,
 which warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Former Sponsor at the time of the initial public offering of the Company. At September 30, 2024, 110,000 was drawn on the note.

Securities Listing

On October 7, 2024, the Company received a notice (the Delisting Notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that
 Nasdaq has determined to delist the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market and will suspend trading in those securities effective at the open of business on October 14, 2024. Nasdaq reached its decision pursuant to Nasdaq
 IM-5101-2 because the Company did not complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its Initial Public Offering registration statement.

Following the suspension of trading on Nasdaq, the Company s Units, shares of Class A common stock and redeemable warrants trade on the OTC Pink
 Marketplace under the symbols BHACU, BHAC and BHACW, respectively. The Company remains subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Uncertain Tax Position

We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the
 basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon
 ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. Our operations included those activities necessary to consummate an Initial Business Combination. As such, we deducted startup and operating costs for tax purposes. Additionally, the
 Company has taken the position that no income should the apportioned to Florida in its Florida state tax return. As there is uncertainty in the deduction of startup and operating costs and the apportionment of income to the State of
 Florida, the Company recognized a reserve for uncertain tax positions on the balance sheet. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company reported 115,870 and 955,617, respectively, on the balance sheet for these uncertainty.

Results of Operations

Our entire activity from inception up to October 7, 2021 was in preparation for our initial public offering and, since the consummation of our initial public offering, the search for and consumption of a
 prospective target business. We will not generate any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our Initial Business Combination, at the earliest.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs in pursuit of our Initial Business Combination. We have determined that we will not be able to sustain
 operations for the next twelve months without additional financing. As of September 30, 2024, we had 594,619 in our operating bank account available for working capital needs and a working capital deficit of 6,982,150.

Until the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity needs have been satisfied through a payment of 25,000 from the Former Sponsor to cover certain expenses on behalf of the
 Company in exchange for the issuance of the founder shares (as defined in Note 3) and a Note Payable to Former Sponsor (Note 3) in the amount of 563,009 that was fully repaid on October 7, 2021.

The Company had net borrowings of 988,402 pursuant to the Convertible Promissory Note issued to the Former Sponsor (Note 5) and on July 31, 2023, the Company issued a non-interest-bearing promissory note
 in the aggregate principal amount of up to 1,052,644 to the Former Sponsor (the Extension Promissory Note ). At the closing of the Purchase Agreement with the Sponsor on November 2, 2023, the Convertible Promissory Note and Extension
 Promissory Note were terminated and of no further force and effect, resulting in loan forgiveness by the note holder.

In association with the Subscription Agreement (discussed in Note 3), the Company has borrowed 1,200,000.

On February 26, 2024, the Company issued the FI Sponsor Promissory Note to the Sponsor in the total principal amount of up to 500,000 and had borrowed 110,000 under the FI Sponsor Promissory Note at
 September 30, 2024.

XCF has agreed to pay certain costs on behalf of the Company. Since entering into the Business Combination Agreement and as of September 30, 2024, XCF has paid 217,232 to or on behalf of the Company.

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to
 Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution, should the Company be unable to complete an Initial Business Combination, raises substantial doubt about the Company s
 ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has until February 7, 2025 (as may be extended until April 7, 2025), to consummate an Initial Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate an Initial
 Business Combination by this time. If an Initial Business Combination is not consummated by this date, and the Termination Date is not extended beyond April 7, 2025, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. No
 adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after February 7, 2025 (as may be extended until April 7, 2025).

To alleviate the Company s assessment of going concern, on March 11, 2024, the Company entered into a proposed Business Combination Agreement with XCF.

Contractual Obligations

Registration Rights

The holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private
 placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the initial
 public offering. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect
 to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our Initial Business Combination.

However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lockup period,
 which occurs (i) in the case of the founder shares, as described in the following paragraph, and (ii) in the case of the private placement warrants and the respective shares of our Class A common stock underlying such warrants, 30 days
 after the completion of our Initial Business Combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

Except as described in this Quarterly Report, the holders of the founder shares (including the anchor investors) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until the earlier to
 occur of (a) one year after the completion of our initial Business Combination, or (b) subsequent to our Initial Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as
 adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our Initial Business Combination, or (y) the
 date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other
 property. Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of our Sponsor with respect to any founder shares.

In addition, pursuant to the registration rights agreement, our Sponsor, upon completion of an Initial Business Combination, will be entitled to nominate up to three individuals for election to our board of
 directors, as long as the Sponsor holds any securities covered by the registration rights agreement.

Underwriting Agreement

The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.0 of the gross proceeds of the initial public offering, or 4.6 million. In addition, the
 underwriters were entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or 8,050,000. As a result, 7,548,450 of the deferred underwriters fee was reversed through equity as it
 related to the Redeemable Class A common stock issued in the initial public offering and 501,550 of the deferred underwriters fee was reversed through the statement of operations as it related to the public warrants issued in the
 initial public offering.

Capital Market Advisors

In 2023, the Company engaged the services of multiple entities to act as capital market advisors, specifically to advise on market conditions, advise in connection with seeking an extension for completing
 an Initial Business Combination, advise in connection with a possible Initial Business Combination, and acting as a placement agent in connection with a private placement of equity, equity-linked, convertible and/or debt securities or
 other capital or debt raising transaction. No fees are due the advisors until consummation of the Initial Business Combination and are payable at that time in a combination of cash and shares of common stock of the public company entity
 that survives the Initial Business Combination. In accordance with ASC 718, at the effective date of November 2, 2023, the value of the shares issuable as of the execution date of the contracts was 312,600. Additionally, the Company will
 pay 3,500,000 plus an amount equal to 4.0 (together the Deferred CMA Fees of the sum of (A) the gross proceeds raised from investors identified by the advisor received by the Company or Target plus (B) proceeds released from the
 Trust Account in connection with the closing of the Initial Business Combination with respect to any stockholder of the Company that (x) entered into a non-redemption or other similar agreement or (y) did not redeem shares of the
 Company s Class A common stock.

In accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, ASC 450 ), the Company has not recognized a liability for the value of the potential issuance of shares or the Deferred CMA Fees since the completion of
 an Initial Business Combination is a performance condition that is not yet considered probable.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
 management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements, and income
 and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:

Note Payable - Polar

We report the Note Payable Polar at fair value using a bond plus call plus model. Included in the model are significant estimates and judgment about inputs into the model. Deviations from these estimates
 could result in a significant difference to our financial results.

Share Subscription Agreement - Polar

The share subscription agreement is reported based on the residual value of the Subscription Agreement and was determined based on the residual amount of the proceeds received less the fair value of the
 Note Payable Polar. Deviations from the estimated fair value of the Note Payable Polar could result in a significant difference to our financial results.

2024 Non-Redemption Agreements

The 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements is reported at fair value using a likelihood-weighted scenario analysis model. The model uses significant judgment and estimates as inputs in the model. Deviations from
 the estimated fair value of the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements could result in a significant difference to our financial results.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Our management does not believe that there are any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, that would have a material effect on our unaudited consolidated
 condensed financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

JOBS Act

The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed
 to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not
 comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, the financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply
 with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.

Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if,
 as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to
 Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be
 adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain
 executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years
 following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.

Item 4. 

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
 recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
 required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principle executive officer and principle financial officer, to allow timely decisions
 regarding required disclosure. As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our principle executive officer and principle financial officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
 our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our principle executive officer and principle financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due to material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting of complex financial instruments and the failure to properly design the financial closing and
 reporting process to record, review and monitor compliance with generally accepted accounting principles for transactions on a timely basis.

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
 only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
 benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected
 all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
 will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have
 materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. 

Legal Proceedings

There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team.

Item 1A. 

Risk Factors

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,
 filed with the SEC on April 23, 2024 (the Annual Report ). Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to
 us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report, except for the
 below risk factor. We may disclose changes to such risk factor or disclose additional risk factor from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

Nasdaq has delisted our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors 
 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.

On October 7, 2024, the Company received the Delisting Notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating
 that Nasdaq has determined to delist the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market and will suspend trading in those securities effective at the open of business on October 14, 2024. Nasdaq reached its decision pursuant to
 Nasdaq IM-5101-2 because the Company did not complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its Initial Public Offering registration statement.

Following the suspension of trading on Nasdaq, the Company s Units, shares of
 Class A common stock and redeemable warrants trade on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbols BHACU, BHAC and BHACW, respectively. As a result, we may face significant material adverse consequences, including:

reduced liquidity for our securities;

a determination that our Class A common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to
 adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our
 securities;

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage with respect to our securities; and

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

Additionally, the National
 Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because our securities were
 delisted from Nasdaq, our Units, Class A common stock and warrants do not qualify as covered securities under under the Securities Act and we are
 subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities . 

Item 2. 

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

Not Applicable.

Item 3. 

Defaults upon Senior Securities

None.

Item 4. 

Mine Safety Disclosures.

Not applicable.

Item 5. 

Other Information.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, of our directors or executive officers
 adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as such term is
 defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
