of the Company s total revenue for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The remaining revenue primarily includes royalty revenue from licensing arrangements and revenue from wafer testing services performed for third parties. See Note 8 for the disaggregation of the Company s revenue by geographic region and by product family. 
 
 The Company sells its products primarily through third-party distributors, value-added resellers, original equipment manufacturers OEMs ), original design manufacturers ODMs and electronic manufacturing service EMS providers. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and , respectively, of the Company s product sales were made through distribution arrangements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and , respectively, of the Company s product sales were made through distribution arrangements. These distribution arrangements contain enforceable rights and obligations specific to those distributors and not the end customers. Purchase orders, which are generally governed by sales agreements or the Company s standard terms of sale, set the final terms for unit price, quantity, shipping and payment agreed between the Company and the customer. The Company considers purchase orders to be the contracts with customers. The unit price as stated on the purchase orders is considered the observable, stand-alone selling price for the arrangements. 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company excludes taxes assessed by government authorities, such as sales taxes, from revenue. 
 
 Product sales consist of a single performance obligation that the Company satisfies at a point in time. The Company recognizes product revenue from distributors and direct end customers when the following events have occurred: (a) the Company has transferred physical possession of the products, (b) the Company has a present right to payment, (c) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products. In accordance with the shipping terms specified in the contracts, these criteria are generally met when the products are shipped from the Company s facilities (such as the Ex Works shipping term) or delivered to the customers locations (such as the Delivered Duty Paid shipping term). 
 
 Under certain consignment agreements, the Company recognizes revenue when the customers consume the products from the consigned inventory locations, at which time control transfers to the customers and the Company issues invoices.

million and million, respectively. The increase in the customer prepayment balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from an increase in unfulfilled customer orders for which the Company had received payments. 
 
 Practical Expedients 
 
 The Company has elected the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. 
 
 The Company s standard payment terms generally require customers to pay to days after the Company satisfies the performance obligations. For those customers who are required to pay in advance, the Company satisfies the performance obligations generally within a quarter. For these reasons, the Company has elected not to determine whether contracts with customers contain significant financing components. 
 
 The Company s unsatisfied performance obligations primarily include products held in consignment arrangements and customer purchase orders for products that the Company has not yet shipped. Because the Company expects to fulfill these performance obligations within one year, the Company has elected not to disclose the amount of these remaining performance obligations.

For the first goal, the executive officers can earn up to of the target number of the 2024 Executive PSUs based on the achievement of the Company s average three-year (2024 through 2026) revenue growth rate in excess of the analog industry s average three-year revenue growth rate as published by the Semiconductor Industry Association (the SIA ). For the second goal, the executive officers can earn of the target number of the 2024 Executive PSUs if the Company achieves a reduction in 2026 of 25 global combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions against the 2022 baseline. For the third goal, the executive officers can earn of the target number of the 2024 Executive PSUs if more than one-third of the Company s total 2026 revenue in the automotive market is generated from Electronic Vehicle EV automakers. In addition, for the third goal, the executive officers can earn of the target number of the 2024 Executive PSUs if total 2026 revenue from products enabling EV powertrains and EV 48V systems grows to 200 of the 2023 baseline. For the first goal, a percentage of the 2024 Executive PSUs will fully vest on December 31, 2026, depending on the degree to which the pre-determined goal is met during the performance period. The 2024 Executive PSUs related to the second and the third goal will fully vest on December 31, 2026 if the pre-determined goals are met during the performance period. Assuming the achievement of the highest level of the performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2024 Executive PSUs will be million. In February 2024, the Compensation Committee granted PSUs to certain non-executive employees, which represent the target number of shares that can be earned based on the degree of achievement of the Company s 2025 revenue goals for certain regions or product line divisions, or based on the degree of achievement of the Company s average two-year (2024 and 2025) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry s average two-year revenue growth rate as published by the SIA 2024 Non-Executive PSUs ).

The remaining 2024 Non-Executive PSUs will vest over the following two years on a quarterly basis. Assuming the achievement of the highest level of performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2024 Non-Executive PSUs will be million.

 Stock Repurchase Program In October 2023, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to million in the aggregate of its common stock through October 29, 2026. Shares are retired upon repurchase. The Company repurchased and shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Stock repurchased under the program may be made through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or other structures in accordance with applicable state and federal securities laws, at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate. The timing and the number of any repurchased common stock will be determined by the Company s management based on its evaluation of market conditions, legal requirements, share price, and other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares, and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1 excise tax based on the value of certain stock repurchases in excess of stock issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. This provision did not have an impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 The Company s agreements with these third-party customers were made in the ordinary course of business and may be terminated with or without cause by these customers with advance notice. Although the Company may experience a short-term disruption in the distribution of its products and a short-term decline in revenue if its agreement with any of the distributors were terminated, the Company believes that such termination would not have a material adverse effect on its financial statements because it would be able to engage alternative distributors, resellers and other distribution channels to deliver its products to end customers within a short period following any termination of the agreement with a distributor.

An impairment exists when the fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not consider the impairment of its investments to be a result of credit losses. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. When evaluating a debt security for impairment, management reviews factors such as the Company s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and the credit quality of the investment.

million, or of pre-tax income. The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million, or of pre-tax income. The effective tax rates were lower than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to foreign income from the Company s subsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The decrease in the effective tax rates relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the global intangible low-taxed income GILTI tax . 
 
 The income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was million, or of pre-tax income. The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was million, or of pre-tax income. The effective tax rates were lower than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to foreign income from the Company s subsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

 On December 27, 2023, the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 (the Bermuda CIT Act was enacted and signed into law. It includes a 15 CIT applicable to Bermuda businesses that are multinational enterprises MNE with annual revenue of 750M or more beginning in 2025. The Bermuda CIT Act also includes an Economic Transition Adjustment ETA that requires MNEs to revalue their assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, at their fair value as of September 30, 2023. There is an election to opt out of the ETA. As the Bermuda CIT Act is not effective until January 1, 2025, the Company is evaluating whether or not to adopt this ETA. Based on the information available, the Company has not recorded any changes to income tax expense related to the Bermuda CIT Act as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In September 2024, a subsidiary of the Company was granted a tax credit with a ten-year life by a foreign jurisdiction. The tax credit may be utilized beginning in tax year 2025 to offset income tax liabilities in that jurisdiction, subject to various criteria as outlined by the granting authorities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has evaluated the sources of income necessary to benefit from the tax credit and has determined that it currently does not meet the more likely than not criteria for realization of this deferred tax asset. As a result, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance on this deferred tax asset. The Company is evaluating the steps necessary, some of which are not within its immediate control, to generate sufficient future taxable income in the required jurisdiction and will reassess the realizability of this deferred tax asset each reporting period.

 Overview 
 
 We are a fabless global company that provides high-performance, semiconductor-based power electronics solutions. MPS s mission is to reduce energy and material consumption to improve all aspects of quality of life and create a sustainable future. Founded in 1997 by our CEO Michael Hsing, MPS has three core strengths: deep system-level knowledge, strong semiconductor design expertise, and innovative proprietary technologies in the areas of semiconductor processes, system integration, and packaging. These combined advantages are designed to enable MPS to deliver reliable, compact, and monolithic solutions that are highly energy-efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible while providing a consistent return on investment to our stockholders. We operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry. We are subject to industry downturns, but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term. Historically, our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half although various factors, such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions, could impact this trend. We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ICs. This has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths. Following the introduction of a product, our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up. Typical supply chain lead times for orders are generally 16 to 26 weeks. These factors, combined with the fact that our customers can cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty to the customer, make the forecasting of our orders, revenue and expenses difficult. 
 
 We derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in Asia, where our products are incorporated into end-user products. Our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 94 and 89 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 93 and 86 of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our revenue from indirect sales to one customer, which primarily comprised power management solutions for artificial intelligence AI applications, was 15 and 12 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 18 and 7 of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 We derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our DC to DC converter products which serve the enterprise data, storage and computing, automotive, communications, consumer and industrial markets. We believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity. 
 
 Macroeconomic Conditions and Regulations 
 
 The semiconductor industry has historically been impacted by various macro-economic challenges including fluctuations in consumer spending, fluctuations in demand for semiconductors, rising inflation, increased interest rates, and fluctuations in currency rates. We remain cautious in light of continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and will continue to monitor the potential impact on our operations. The extent and duration of the direct and indirect impact of macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position remain uncertain and depend on future developments. 
 We closely monitor changes to export control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements. To date, no restrictions have had a material impact on our revenue and operations. We will continue to monitor any changes to export control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements and are committed to complying with all applicable trade laws, regulations and other requirements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying disclosures. Estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements are, by their nature, uncertain and unpredictable, and depend upon, among other things, many factors outside of our control, including demand for our products, economic conditions and other current and future events, such as macroeconomic factors, including the impact of global economic uncertainties, Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Middle East conflict. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and any such differences may be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Cost of revenue was 276.7 million, or 44.6 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 211.3 million, or 44.5 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 65.4 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by higher shipment volume, particularly of power management solutions for AI applications. 
 
 Gross margin was 55.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 55.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin was mainly driven by an increase in inventory write-downs as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by lower warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue and product mix. 
 
 Cost of revenue was 709.0 million, or 44.7 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 597.1 million, or 43.7 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 111.9 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by higher average costs due to product mix. 
 
 Gross margin was 55.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 56.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin was mainly driven by an increase in inventory write-downs and warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by lower manufacturing overhead costs. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 R D expenses primarily consist of cash compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation and deferred compensation for design and product engineers, expenses related to new product development and supplies, and facility costs.

The 20.3 million increase in R D expenses was primarily due to a 6.9 million increase in cash compensation and benefits, a 3.5 million increase in new product development expenses, a 3.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, a 1.9 million increase in expense related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan liabilities, and a 0.9 million increase in laboratory supplies.

The 31.2 million increase in SG A expenses was primarily driven by a 14.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, a 5.5 million increase in cash compensation and benefits, a 2.8 million increase in expense related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan liabilities, a 2.6 million increase in sales commissions, and a 2.2 million increase in legal expenses.

The 55.8 million increase in SG A expenses was primarily driven by a 32.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, a 6.9 million increase in cash compensation and benefits, a 3.9 million increase in professional services, and a 2.7 million increase in expense related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan liabilities. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income, net, was 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income was primarily due to an increase in amortization of discount on available-for-sale securities, and an increase in income related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan investments. 
 
 Other income, net, was 27.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income was primarily due to an increase in amortization of discount on available-for-sale securities, and an increase in income related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan investments, partially offset by an increase in charitable contributions. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 The income tax provision for interim periods is generally determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate and adjusted for discrete items, if any, in the relevant period. Each quarter the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if our estimated tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. 
 
 The income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 29.9 million, or 17.1 of pre-tax income. The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 66.0 million, or 16.4 of pre-tax income. The effective tax rates were lower than the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The decrease in the effective tax rates relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the GILTI tax . 
 
 The income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 16.7 million, or 12.1 of pre-tax income. The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 55.8 million, or 14.5 of pre-tax income. The effective tax rates were lower than the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The decrease in the effective tax rates relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the GILTI tax. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development enacted model rules for a new global minimum tax framework, also known as Pillar Two, and certain governments globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation considering these model rules. These rules did not have a material impact on our taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 In December 2023, the Bermuda CIT Act was enacted and signed into law. See Note 14 for further details. 
 
 In September 2024, one of our subsidiaries was granted a tax credit with a ten-year life by a foreign jurisdiction. The tax credit may be utilized beginning in tax year 2025 to offset income tax liabilities in that jurisdiction, subject to various criteria as outlined by the granting authorities. As of September 30, 2024, we have evaluated the sources of income necessary to benefit from the tax credit and have determined that we currently do not meet the more likely than not criteria for realization of this deferred tax asset. As a result, we have recorded a full valuation allowance on this deferred tax asset. We are evaluating the steps necessary, some of which are not within our immediate control, to generate sufficient future taxable income in the required jurisdiction and will reassess the realizability of this deferred tax asset each reporting period. A release of the valuation allowance could result in a significant one-time noncash tax benefit.

132,571 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 135.8 million increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to increased accounts receivable collections and the collection of 50.0 million of other receivables related to a long-term wafer supply agreement, partially offset by increased inventory purchases. This increase was also affected by changes in other working capital. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 83.4 million increase in cash used in investing activities compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase of 37.2 million in purchases of property and equipment and the 33.3 million acquisition in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 57.5 million increase in cash used in financing activities compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase of 43.5 million in dividend and dividend equivalent payments.

Cash Requirements 
 
 Although consequences of economic uncertainties and macroeconomic conditions and other factors could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future, and our cash requirements may fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that our balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 1,462.4 million as of September 30, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. 
 
 Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations: 
 
 Purchase Obligations 
 
 Purchase obligations represent commitments to our suppliers and other parties requiring the purchases of goods or services. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of wafer and other inventory purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, construction of manufacturing and R D facilities, purchases of production and other equipment, and license arrangements. 
 
 In May 2022, we entered into a long-term supply agreement in order to secure manufacturing production capacity for silicon wafers over a four-year period. As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining prepayments under this agreement of 120.0 million, of which 60.0 million was classified as short-term. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, total estimated future unconditional purchase commitments to all suppliers and other parties, net of the 120.0 million prepayment, were 586.9 million, of which 470.9 million was classified as short-term. 
 
 Transition Tax Liability 
 
 The transition tax liability represents the one-time, mandatory deemed repatriation tax imposed on previously deferred foreign earnings under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the 2017 Tax Act ). As permitted by the 2017 Tax Act, we have elected to pay the tax liability in installments on an interest-free basis through 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining liability totaled 6.2 million, all of which was classified as short-term. 
 
 Operating Leases 
 
 Operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted remaining lease payments primarily for our leased facilities and equipment. As of September 30, 2024, these obligations totaled 16.3 million, of which 2.8 million was classified as short-term. 
 
 Capital Return to Stockholders In October 2023, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 640.0 million in the aggregate of our common stock through October 29, 2026. Shares are retired upon repurchase. We repurchased 6,000 and 19,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 5.5 million and 14.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 622.1 million remained available for future repurchases under the program. 
 
 We currently have a dividend program approved by our Board of Directors, pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Based on our historical practice, stockholders of record as of the last business day of the quarter are entitled to receive the quarterly cash dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors, which are payable to the stockholders in the following month. As of September 30, 2024, accrued dividends totaled 61.0 million. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 
 Other Long-Term Obligations 
 
 Other long-term obligations primarily include payments for deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, these obligations totaled 88.3 million.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 For a discussion of market risks, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes or developments that would have materially altered, or were reasonably likely to materially alter, the market risk assessment performed as of December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, and due to the finding of the material weakness described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, during the year-end financial reporting process of fiscal year 2023, a material weakness was identified in internal control over financial reporting within the Company s demand forecast process regarding excess and obsolete inventory. The material weakness resulted from ineffective design of the controls related to management s review and documentation of the Company s inventory demand information and other assumptions used to determine the inventory carrying value adjustments necessary to record such quantities at the lower of their cost or net realizable value. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This material weakness did not result in a misstatement to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Notwithstanding the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above, management believes and has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. Ongoing Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weakness With respect to the material weakness described above, management, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, has implemented measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. However, the weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. The Company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and refine its remediation plan as appropriate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As described above, we are taking steps to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Other than in connection with the remediation process described above, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property, claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and employment matters. We may also be subject to litigation initiated by our stockholders. These proceedings often involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims. As of September 30, 2024 , there were no material pending legal proceedings to which we were a party. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The Company s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the heading Risk Factors. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities In October 2023, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 640.0 million in the aggregate of our common stock through October 29, 2026. Shares are retired upon repurchase. We repurchased 6,000 and 19,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 5.5 million and 14.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Stock repurchases under the program may be made through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or other structures in accordance with applicable state and federal securities laws, at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate. The timing and the number of shares of any repurchased common stock will be determined by our management based on the evaluation of market conditions, legal requirements, stock price, and other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any particular number of shares and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The following table represents details of our stock repurchase transactions during the three months ended September 30, 2024:
