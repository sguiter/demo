 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained in this Quarterly Report that include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, need for financing, competitive position and potential growth opportunities represent management's beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information and they do not consider the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "believes," "intends," "may," "should," "anticipates," "expects," "could," "plans," "estimates," "projects," "targets" or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy or trends. Such statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results, and actual future results could differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements. 
 Among the factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed under "Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Annual Report"). We continue to face many risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: 
 the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGL prices; 
 regional supply and demand factors, any delays, curtailment delays or interruptions of production, and any governmental order, rule or regulation that may impose production limits; 
 cost and availability of gathering, pipeline, refining, transportation and other midstream and downstream activities, which could result in a prolonged shut-in of our wells that may adversely affect our reserves, financial condition and results of operations; 
 severe weather and other risks that lead to a lack of any available markets; 
 our ability to successfully complete mergers, acquisitions or divestitures; 
 the inability or failure of the Company to successfully integrate the acquired assets into its operations and development activities; 
 the potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; 
 failure to realize any of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures or other equity investments; 
 risks relating to our operations, including development drilling and testing results and performance of acquired properties and newly drilled wells; 
 inability to prove up undeveloped acreage and maintain production on leases; 
 any reduction in our borrowing base on our Credit Facility from time to time and our ability to repay any excess borrowings as a result of such reduction; 
 the impact of our derivative strategy and the results of future settlement; 
 our ability to comply with the financial covenants contained in our Credit Facility and in our Senior Notes; 
 changes in general economic, business or industry conditions, including changes in inflation rates, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates; 
 conditions in the capital, financial and credit markets and our ability to obtain capital needed for development and exploration operations on favorable terms or at all; 
 the loss of certain tax deductions; 
 risks associated with executing our business strategy, including any changes in our strategy; 
 risks associated with concentration of operations in one major geographic area; 
 legislative or regulatory changes, including initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing, regulation of greenhouse gases, water conservation, seismic activity, weatherization, or protection of certain species of wildlife, or of sensitive environmental areas; 
 the ability to receive drilling and other permits or approvals and rights-of-way in a timely manner (or at all), which may be restricted by governmental regulation and legislation; 
 restrictions on the use of water, including limits on the use of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water well permits recently imposed by the RRC in an effort to control induced seismicity in the Permian Basin; 
 changes in government environmental policies and other environmental risks; the availability of drilling equipment and the timing of production; tax consequences of business transactions; public health crises, such as pandemics and

 epidemics, and any related government policies and actions and the effects of such public health crises on the oil and natural gas industry, pricing and demand for oil and natural gas and supply chain logistics; 
 general domestic and international economic, market and political conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the global response to such conflicts; 
 risks related to litigation; and 
 cybersecurity threats, technology system failures and data security issues. 
 In light of such risks and uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, or if earlier, as of the date they were made. We do not intend to, and disclaim any obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statements unless required by securities law.

Recent Developments 
 Geopolitical Events 
 The general domestic and international political conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the global response to such conflicts could prolong market volatility or cause a decline in commodity prices. 
 The Company cannot estimate the length or gravity of the future impact these events will have on the Company's results of operations, financial position, liquidity and the value of its oil and natural gas reserves. 
 Impairment of EOR Project 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a 30.2 million impairment related to the discontinuation of our EOR Project, including a 28.9 million non-cash impairment and 1.3 million cash impairment related to the termination of the Kinder Morgan CO 2 contract.

 2024 New Mexico Asset Acquisition 
 On May 7, 2024, the Company closed on an acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in Eddy County, New Mexico ("2024 New Mexico Asset Acquisition"), which included 13,900 contiguous net acres to the Company's existing acreage in Eddy County, for a cash purchase price of approximately 19.1 million plus 0.5 million in transaction costs. The 2024 New Mexico Asset Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition, with the final purchase price and transaction costs being capitalized to oil and natural gas properties. The acquisition was funded through a combination of proceeds from the 2024 Equity Offering and cash on hand. 
 RPC Power Joint Venture 
 In January 2023, the Company formed a joint venture, RPC Power, for the purpose of constructing, owning and operating power generation assets which became fully operational in September of 2024. These assets will use the Company s produced natural gas to power a portion of its oilfield operations in Yoakum County, Texas. In May 2024, the Company entered into the A R LLC Agreement to expand the scope of its joint venture to include the constructing, owning, and operating of additional new power generation and storage assets, which are expected to be operational throughout 2025, for the sale of energy and ancillary services to ERCOT. 
 2024 Equity Offering 
 On April 8, 2024, the Company issued and sold 1,015,000 shares of common stock at a price of 27.00 per share. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately 25.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses.

Oil and Natural Gas Revenues 
 Our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, including the sale of NGLs that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. Realized prices and revenues from product sales are a function of the volumes produced, product quality, market prices, and gas Btu content as well as gathering and processing costs. Our revenues from oil, natural gas and NGL sales do not include the effects of derivatives. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in the volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The Company s total oil and natural gas revenue, net decreased by 5.4 million, or 5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Oil revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, oil revenues increased by 0.8 million, or 1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Of the increase, 10.7 million was attributable to an increase in volume, partially offset by 9.9 million attributable to a decrease in realized prices. Volumes increased by 10 while realized prices decreased by 9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Oil volumes increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to increased production from new wells turned to sales in our Champions field. 
 Our realized oil prices decreased 6.92 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which corresponded with a 5.64 decrease in the average WTI price during the same period. 
 
 Natural gas revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, natural gas revenues decreased by 2.2 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. All of the decrease was attributable to a decrease in realized prices. Realized prices were negative during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to weak Permian Basin natural gas prices that did not provide for full recovery of the Company's allocated gathering and processing costs. 
 NGL revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, NGL revenues decreased by 4.0 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. All of the decrease was attributable to a decrease in realized prices. Realized prices were negative during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher allocated gathering and processing costs to the Company's NGLs due to weak Permian Basin natural gas prices, which did not provide for full recovery of the Company's costs. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The Company s total oil and natural gas revenue, net increased by 33.7 million, or 12 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Oil revenues 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, oil revenues increased by 41.4 million, or 15 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the increase, 37.6 million was attributable to an increase in volume and 3.8 million to an increase in realized price. Volumes increased by 14 , while realized prices increased by 1 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Oil volumes increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to a full nine months of volumes contributed from the properties acquired in the 2023 New Mexico Acquisition in addition to increased production from new wells turned to sales in our Champions field. 
 Our realized oil prices increased 0.93 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which corresponded with a 1.31 increase in the average WTI price during the same period. 

31 

Natural gas revenues 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, natural gas revenues decreased by 3.0 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. All of the decrease was attributable to a decrease in realized prices. Realized prices were negative during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to weak Permian Basin natural gas prices that did not provide for full recovery of the Company's allocated gathering and processing costs. 
 NGL revenues 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, NGL revenues decreased by 4.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. All of the decrease was attributable to a decrease in realized prices.

Costs and Expenses 
 The following table presents the Company's operating costs and expenses and other (income) expenses: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Costs and Expenses: (In thousands) Lease operating expenses 18,532 16,898 51,793 43,287 Production and ad valorem taxes 7,002 7,242 21,407 18,573 Exploration costs 375 231 439 643 Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion 20,722 18,706 55,971 46,390 Other impairments 30,158 30,158 Administrative costs 5,879 5,530 17,862 17,497 Share-based compensation 1,720 1,109 6,693 3,448 General and administrative expense 7,599 6,639 24,555 20,945 Transaction costs 473 221 1,143 5,760 Interest expense, net 8,789 10,338 26,713 21,515 (Gain) loss on derivatives, net (24,217) 35,345 (6,781) 20,925 (Income) loss from equity method investment 210 (23) 235 213 Income tax expense 7,033 3,922 23,521 23,054 
 Lease Operating Expenses ("LOE") 
 LOE are the costs incurred in the operation and maintenance of producing properties. Expenses for electricity, compression, direct labor, saltwater disposal and materials and supplies comprise the most significant portion of our lease operating expenses. Certain operating cost components, such as direct labor and materials and supplies, generally remain relatively fixed across broad production volume ranges, but can fluctuate depending on activities performed during a specific period. For instance, repairs to our pumping equipment or surface facilities or subsurface maintenance result in increased production expenses in periods during which they are performed. Certain operating cost components, such as saltwater disposal associated with produced water, are variable and increase or decrease as hydrocarbon production levels and the volume of completion water disposal increases or decreases. 
 The Company s LOE increased by 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by a 1.8 million increase due to higher production volume and a 0.5 million increase in workover expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in certain expenses such as chemicals, fuel and repair costs. 
 The Company s LOE increased by 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by a 5.4 million increase due to higher production volume from a full nine months of volumes in 2024 from the properties acquired in the 2023 New Mexico Acquisition in addition to increased production from new wells turned to sales in our Champions field and a 3.1 million increase in workover expense. 
 Production and Ad Valorem Tax Expense 
 Production taxes are paid on produced oil, natural gas and NGLs based on a percentage of revenues at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. In general, the production taxes we pay correlate to changes in our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues. We are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located. Ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and natural gas properties, which also trend with oil and natural gas prices and vary across the different counties in which we operate. 
 Production and ad valorem taxes decreased by 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower natural gas and NGL revenues. Production and ad valorem 
 33 

taxes increased by 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher oil revenues for the period. 
 Depletion, Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion ("DD A") Expense 
 DD A expense is the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop oil, natural gas and NGLs. All costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of properties (excluding costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds, delay lease rentals, dry holes and overhead related to exploration activities) are capitalized. Capitalized costs are depleted using the units of production method. 
 Accretion expense relates to ARO. We record the fair value of the liability for ARO in the period in which the liability is incurred (at the time the wells are drilled or acquired) with the offset to property cost. The liability accretes each period until it is settled or the well is sold, at which time the liability is removed. 
 DD A expense increased by 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in production volumes in our Champions field. 
 DD A expense increased by 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to a full nine months of production volumes and corresponding DD A expense from the properties acquired in the 2023 New Mexico Acquisition. 
 Other Impairments 
 The cost of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties are assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. We compare the undiscounted future cash flows of the oil, natural gas and NGL properties to the carrying amount of the oil, natural gas and NGL properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we adjust the carrying amount of the oil, natural gas and NGL properties to their estimated fair value. 
 The Company recognized an impairment charge of 30.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of a non-cash impairment charge of 28.9 million and a cash impairment charge of 1.3 million related to the termination of the Kinder Morgan CO 2 contract. The impairment loss relates to the discontinuation of the Company's EOR project, in favor of redeploying the required future capital and salvaging certain assets for use in the Company's conventional vertical and horizontal development programs. There was no impairment loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative ("G A") Expense 
 G A expenses include corporate overhead such as payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, share-based compensation expense, office rent for our headquarters, audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance. G A expenses are reported net of overhead recoveries. 
 G A expense increased by 1.0 million, or 14 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation due to new grants. 
 G A expense increased by 3.6 million, or 17 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation due to new grants and accelerated vestings. 
 
 Transaction Costs 
 Transaction costs represent costs incurred on successful, unsuccessful or potential business transactions. The transaction costs of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to the RPC Power Joint Venture, potential transactions that the Company is evaluating as well as a transaction that the Company decided not to pursue further. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the transaction costs of 0.2 million and 5.8 million, respectively, primarily related to the 2023 New Mexico Acquisition. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower principal balances on outstanding debt as well as settlements on our interest 
 34 

rate derivatives. Interest expense increased by 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the higher debt balances associated with the financing for the 2023 New Mexico Acquisition. 
 Gain (Loss) on Derivatives 
 The Company recognizes settlements and changes in the fair value of its derivative contracts as a single component within other income (expense) on its condensed consolidated statements of operations. We have oil and natural gas derivative contracts, including fixed price swaps, basis swaps and collars, that settle against various indices. The following table presents the components of the Company's gain (loss) on derivatives, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) Settlements on derivative contracts 815 (6,269) (910) (13,660) Non-cash gain (loss) on derivatives 23,402 (29,076) 7,691 (7,265) Gain (loss) on derivatives, net 24,217 (35,345) 6,781 (20,925) 
 Cash gains or losses on settled derivative contracts related to contracts that settle during the period and are a function of the difference in settled versus contractual prices and the associated hedged volumes for each underlying commodity. Non-cash gains or losses on derivatives relate to unsettled contracts and are a function of changes in derivative fair values associated with fluctuations in the forward price curves for the commodities relative to contractual pricing for our derivative contracts outstanding. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the future tax consequences or benefits of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements using enacted tax rates. See Note 12 - Income Taxes for further discussion of income taxes. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) Current income tax expense 3,374 57 14,789 5,452 Deferred income tax expense 3,659 3,865 8,732 17,602 Total income tax expense 7,033 3,922 23,521 23,054 Effective income tax rate 21.5 31.2 23.2 23.9 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The business of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive. Because oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are a depleting resource, like all upstream operators, we must make capital investments to grow and even sustain production. The Company s principal liquidity requirements are to finance its operations, fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, make cash distributions and satisfy any indebtedness obligations. Cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and the significant capital expenditures required to more fully develop the Company s oil and natural gas properties. Historically, our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility, and the issuance of our Senior Notes. At times and as needed, we may also issue debt or equity securities, including through transactions under our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. In April 2024, the Company issued equity securities and used the proceeds to finance an acquisition, repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. We estimate the combination of the sources of capital discussed above will continue to be adequate to meet our short and long-term liquidity needs. 
 35 

Cash on hand and operating cash flow can be subject to fluctuations due to trends and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Likewise, our ability to issue equity and obtain debt financing on favorable terms may be impacted by a variety of market factors as well as fluctuations in our results of operations. 
 For further discussion of risks related to our liquidity and capital resources, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors." 
 
 Working Capital 
 Working capital is the difference in our current assets and our current liabilities. Working capital is an indication of liquidity and potential need for short-term funding. The change in our working capital requirements is driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to, and the timing of collections from customers, the level and timing of spending for expansion activity, and the timing of debt maturities. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 31.9 million compared to a deficit of 31.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The current portion of our Senior Notes, which includes our regularly scheduled principal payments of 5 million per quarter, accounts for 20 million of our working capital deficit as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. We utilize our Credit Facility and cash on hand to manage the timing of cash flows and fund short-term working capital deficits. At September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of 13.3 million and 245 million of undrawn capacity under our Credit Facility.
