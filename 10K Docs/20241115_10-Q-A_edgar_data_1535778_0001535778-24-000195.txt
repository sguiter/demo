 period subsequent to the initial investment. In certain instances, MSC Income Fund may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in its stockholders best interest, to consult with the Financial Advisory Firm on its investments in one or more Private Loan portfolio companies. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of MSC Income Fund s investment in a Private Loan portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total Investment Portfolio. MSC Income Fund consulted with and received an assurance certification from the Financial Advisory Firm in arriving at its determination of fair value for its investments in a total of and Private Loan portfolio companies during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing and of the total Private Loan portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A total of Private Loan portfolio companies were reviewed and certified by the Financial Advisory Firm during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, representing of the total Private Loan portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024. Excluding its investments in Private Loan portfolio companies that, as of September 30, 2024, had not been in the Investment Portfolio for at least twelve months subsequent to the initial investment and its investments in Private Loan portfolio companies that were not reviewed because the investment is valued based upon third-party quotes or other independent pricing, of the Private Loan portfolio at fair value was reviewed and certified by the Financial Advisory Firm during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For valuation purposes, all of MSC Income Fund s Private Loan portfolio investments are non-control investments. For Private Loan portfolio investments for which it has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, MSC Income Fund generally estimates the fair value based on the assumptions that it believes hypothetical market participants would use to value such Private Loan debt investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method and such Private Loan equity investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Waterfall valuation method. 
 In addition to its internal valuation process, in arriving at estimates of fair value for its investments in its LMM portfolio companies, MSC Income Fund, among other things, consults with the Financial Advisory Firm. The Financial Advisory Firm analyzes and provides observations, recommendations and an assurance certification regarding MSC Income Fund s determinations of the fair value of its LMM portfolio company investments. The Financial Advisory Firm is generally consulted relative to MSC Income Fund s investments in each LMM portfolio company at least once every calendar year, and for MSC Income Fund s investments in new LMM portfolio companies, at least once in the period subsequent to the initial investment. In certain instances, MSC Income Fund may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in its stockholders best interest, to consult with the Financial Advisory Firm on its investments in one or more LMM portfolio companies. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of MSC Income Fund s investment in a LMM portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total Investment Portfolio. MSC Income Fund consulted with and received an assurance certification from the Financial Advisory Firm in arriving at its determination of fair value for its investments in a total of LMM portfolio companies during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, representing and of the total LMM portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A total of LMM portfolio companies were reviewed and certified by the Financial Advisory Firm during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, representing of the total LMM portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024. Excluding its investments in LMM portfolio companies that, as of September 30, 2024, had not been in the Investment Portfolio for at least twelve months subsequent to the initial investment or whose primary purpose is to own real estate for which a third-party appraisal is obtained on at least an annual basis, of the LMM portfolio at fair value was reviewed and certified by the Financial Advisory Firm during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For valuation purposes, all of MSC Income Fund s Middle Market portfolio investments are non-control investments. To the extent sufficient observable inputs are available to determine fair value, MSC Income Fund uses observable inputs to determine the fair value of these investments through obtaining third-party quotes or other independent pricing. For Middle Market portfolio investments for which it has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, MSC Income Fund generally estimates the fair value based on the assumptions that it believes hypothetical market participants would use to value such Middle Market debt investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method and such Middle Market equity investments in a

 For valuation purposes, all of MSC Income Fund s Other Portfolio investments are non-control investments. MSC Income Fund s Other Portfolio investments comprised and of MSC Income Fund s Investment Portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Similar to the LMM investment portfolio, market quotations for Other Portfolio equity investments are generally not readily available. For its Other Portfolio equity investments, MSC Income Fund generally determines the fair value of these investments using the NAV valuation method. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, MSC Income Fund s determination of fair value for its Investment Portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. MSC Income Fund determines the fair value of each individual investment and records changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 
 MSC Income Fund uses an internally developed portfolio investment rating system in connection with its investment oversight, portfolio management and analysis and investment valuation procedures for its Private Loan, LMM and Middle Market portfolio companies. This system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of each Private Loan, LMM and Middle Market portfolio company. 
 Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act permits a BDC s board of directors to designate its executive officers or investment adviser as a valuation designee to determine the fair value for its investment portfolio, subject to the active oversight of the board. MSC Income Fund s Board of Directors has approved policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 2a-5 (the Valuation Procedures and has designated the Adviser, led by a group of Main Street s and the Adviser s executive officers, to serve as the Board of Directors valuation designee. MSC Income Fund believes its Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which it operates and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.

 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this update require incremental disclosures related to a public entity s reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The amendments in this update require more disaggregated information on income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance, but it does not expect ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. The Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards and any that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

 Investment Portfolio Composition 
 MSC Income Fund s principal investment objective is to maximize its investment portfolio s total return by generating current income from its debt investments and current income and capital appreciation from its equity and equity-related investments, including warrants, convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities in a portfolio company. MSC Income Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily through its Private Loan and LMM investment strategies. 
 MSC Income Fund s Private Loan investment strategy is focused on investments in secured debt in privately held companies that generally have annual revenues between million and million, and its Private Loan investments generally range in size from million to million. MSC Income Fund s Private Loan investments primarily consist of debt securities that have primarily been originated directly by the Adviser or, to a lesser extent, through the Adviser s strategic relationships with other investment funds on a collaborative basis through investments that are often referred to in the debt markets as club deals because of the small lender group size. In both cases, MSC Income Fund s Private Loan investments are typically made in a company owned by or in the process of being acquired by a private equity fund. MSC Income Fund s Private Loan portfolio debt investments are generally secured by a first priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and from the original investment date. MSC Income Fund may have the option to co-invest with Main Street and the private equity fund in the equity securities of its Private Loan portfolio companies. 
 MSC Income Fund s LMM investment strategy is focused on investments in secured debt and equity in privately held, LMM companies based in the United States. MSC Income Fund s LMM portfolio companies generally have annual revenues between million and million, and its LMM investments generally range in size from million to million. The LMM debt investments are typically secured by a first priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company, can

 from the original investment date. MSC Income Fund typically makes direct equity investments and/or receives nominally priced equity warrants in connection with a debt investment. 
 MSC Income Fund also maintains a legacy portfolio of investments in Middle Market companies. MSC Income Fund s Middle Market investments are generally debt investments in companies owned by a private equity fund that were originally issued through a syndication financing process. MSC Income Fund has generally stopped making new Middle Market investments and expects its Middle Market investment portfolio to continue to decline in future periods as its existing Middle Market investments are repaid or sold. MSC Income Fund s Middle Market debt investments generally range in size from million to million, are generally secured by a first priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration of between three and from the original investment date. 
 MSC Income Fund s Other Portfolio investments primarily consist of investments that are not consistent with the typical profiles for its Private Loan, LMM or Middle Market portfolio investments, including investments in unaffiliated investment companies and private funds managed by third parties. In the Other Portfolio, MSC Income Fund may incur indirect fees and expenses to third party managers. For Other Portfolio investments, MSC Income Fund generally receives distributions related to the assets held by the portfolio company. Those assets are typically expected to be realized over a five to period. 
 Investment income, consisting of interest, dividends and fees, can fluctuate dramatically due to various factors, including the level of new investment activity, repayments of debt investments or sales of equity interests. Investment income in any given year could also be highly concentrated among several portfolio companies. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MSC Income Fund did not record investment income from any single portfolio company in excess of 10 of total investment income.

 for its Private Loan portfolio, for its LMM portfolio and for its Middle Market portfolio. The weighted-average annual effective yield is not reflective of what an investor in shares of MSC Income Fund s common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect MSC Income Fund s utilization of debt capital in its capital structure, MSC Income Fund s expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. 
 (c) The average EBITDA is calculated using a weighted-average for the Private Loan and Middle Market portfolios and a simple average for the LMM portfolio. These calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including Private Loan portfolio companies, LMM portfolio companies and Middle Market portfolio company, as EBITDA is not a meaningful valuation metric for MSC Income Fund s investments in these portfolio companies, and those portfolio companies whose primary purpose is to own real estate and those portfolio companies whose primary operations have ceased and only residual value remains.

The weighted-average annual effective yield on MSC Income Fund s debt portfolio as of December 31, 2023 including debt investments on non-accrual status was for its Private Loan portfolio, for its LMM portfolio and for its Middle Market portfolio. The weighted-average annual effective yield is not reflective of what an investor in shares of MSC Income Fund s common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect MSC Income Fund s utilization of debt capital in its capital structure, MSC Income Fund s expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. 
 (c) The average EBITDA is calculated using a weighted-average for the Private Loan and Middle Market portfolios and a simple average for the LMM portfolio. These calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including Private Loan portfolio company, as EBITDA is not a meaningful valuation metric for MSC Income Fund s investment in this portfolio company, and those portfolio companies whose primary purpose is to own real estate. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MSC Income Fund achieved an annualized total return on investments of and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MSC Income

 MSIF has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC. MSIF s taxable income includes the taxable income generated by MSIF and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Structured Subsidiaries, which are treated as disregarded entities for tax purposes. As a RIC, MSIF generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary taxable income or capital gains that MSIF distributes to its stockholders. MSIF must generally distribute at least 90 of its investment company taxable income (which is generally its net ordinary taxable income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) and 90 of its tax-exempt income to maintain its RIC status (pass-through tax treatment for amounts distributed). As part of maintaining RIC status, undistributed taxable income (subject to a 4 non-deductible U.S. federal excise tax) pertaining to a given fiscal year may be distributed up to twelve months subsequent to the end of that fiscal year, provided such dividends are declared on or prior to the later of (i) filing of the U.S. federal income tax return for the applicable fiscal year or (ii) the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the year in which such taxable income was generated. 
 The determination of the tax attributes for MSC Income Fund s distributions is made annually, based upon its taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions for a full year. Ordinary dividend distributions from a RIC do not qualify for the 20 maximum tax rate (plus a 3.8 Medicare surtax, if applicable) on dividend income from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations, except to the extent that the RIC received the income in the form of qualifying dividends from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. The tax attributes for distributions will generally include both ordinary income and qualified dividends, but may also include either one or both of capital gains and return of capital.

Therefore, the final taxable income, and the taxable income earned in each period and carried forward for distribution in the following period, may be different than this estimate. 
 The Taxable Subsidiaries primarily hold certain equity investments for MSC Income Fund. The Taxable Subsidiaries permit MSC Income Fund to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass-through entities for tax purposes and to continue to comply with the source-of-income requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated with MSIF for U.S. GAAP financial reporting purposes, and the portfolio investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries are included in MSC Income Fund s consolidated financial statements as portfolio investments and recorded at fair value. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with MSIF for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The taxable income, or loss, of the Taxable Subsidiaries may differ from their book income, or loss, due to temporary book and tax timing differences and permanent differences. The Taxable Subsidiaries are each taxed at corporate income tax rates based on their taxable income. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and the related tax assets and liabilities, of the Taxable Subsidiaries are reflected in MSC Income Fund s consolidated financial statements.

 MSC Income Fund will fund its unfunded commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its investment commitments that are funded at the time they are made (which are typically through existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under the Credit Facilities).

NOTE J 
 of MSC Income Fund s average gross assets. The term gross assets means total assets of MSC Income Fund as disclosed on MSC Income Fund s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Average gross assets are calculated based on MSC Income Fund s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is expensed as incurred. 
 The incentive fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement consists of parts. The first part, referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) for the immediately preceding quarter. The subordinated incentive fee on income is equal to of MSC Income Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding quarter, expressed as a quarterly rate of return on adjusted capital at the beginning of the most recently completed calendar quarter, exceeding (or annualized), subject to a catch up feature (as described below). 
 For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that MSC Income Fund receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus MSC Income Fund s operating expenses for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under any proposed administration agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding taxes and the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount debt instruments and PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that MSC Income Fund has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. For purposes of this fee, adjusted capital means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of MSC Income Fund s common stock (including proceeds from MSC Income Fund s DRIP) reduced for non-liquidating distributions, other than distributions of profits, paid to MSC Income Fund s stockholders and amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to MSC Income Fund s share repurchase program. The subordinated incentive fee on income is expensed in the quarter in which it is incurred. 
 The calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows: 
 No subordinated incentive fee on income shall be payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which MSC Income Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of (or annualized) on adjusted capital; 
 of MSC Income Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to in any calendar quarter annualized) shall be payable to the

 on all of MSC Income Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if the hurdle rate did not apply when the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds annualized) in any calendar quarter; and 
 For any quarter in which MSC Income Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds annualized), the subordinated incentive fee on income shall equal of the amount of MSC Income Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as the hurdle rate and catch-up will have been achieved. 
 The second part of the incentive fee, referred to as the incentive fee on capital gains, is an incentive fee on realized capital gains earned from the portfolio of MSC Income Fund and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). This fee equals of MSC Income Fund s incentive fee capital gains, which equals MSC Income Fund s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. At the end of each reporting period, MSC Income Fund estimates the incentive fee on capital gains and accrues the fee based on a hypothetical liquidation of its portfolio. Therefore, the accrual includes both net realized gains and net unrealized gains (the net unrealized difference between the fair value and the par value of its portfolio), if any. The incentive fee accrued pertaining to the unrealized gain is neither earned nor payable to the Adviser until such time it is realized. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MSC Income Fund incurred base management fees of million and million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MSC Income Fund incurred subordinated incentive fees on income of million and million, respectively. For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MSC Income Fund did incur any capital gains incentive fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MSC Income Fund incurred base management fees of million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MSC Income Fund incurred subordinated incentive fees on income of million and million, respectively. For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MSC Income Fund did incur any capital gains incentive fees. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, MSC Income Fund is required to pay or reimburse the Adviser for administrative services expenses, which include all costs and expenses related to MSC Income Fund s day-to-day administration and management not related to advisory services, whether such administrative services were performed by a third-party service provider or the Adviser or its affiliates (to the extent performed by the Adviser or its affiliates, the Internal Administrative Services ). Internal Administrative Services include, but are not limited to, the cost of an Adviser s personnel performing accounting and compliance functions and other administrative services on behalf of MSC Income Fund.

 of the aggregate gross stock offering proceeds. Pursuant to the transaction whereby the Adviser became the investment adviser to MSC Income Fund, HMS Adviser agreed to permanently waive reimbursement of organizational and offering expenses except for million which remained payable to HMS Adviser and would be reimbursed as part of future issuances of common stock by MSC Income Fund. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, MSC Income Fund reimbursed HMS Adviser million in connection with stock issuances. MSC Income Fund s reimbursement obligation to HMS Adviser for organizational and offering expenses was fully repaid as of June 30, 2023. 
 3. Indemnification 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that the Adviser and its officers, directors, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it acting as MSC Income Fund s agent are entitled to indemnification (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) for any liability or loss suffered by such indemnitee, and such indemnitee will be held harmless for any loss or liability suffered by MSC Income Fund, if (i) the indemnitee has determined, in good faith, that the course of conduct which caused the loss or liability was in MSC Income Fund s best interests, (ii) the indemnitee was acting on behalf of or performing services for MSC Income Fund, (iii) the liability or loss suffered was not the result of negligence, willful malfeasance, bad faith or misconduct by the indemnitee or an affiliate thereof acting as MSC Income Fund s agent and (iv) the indemnification or agreement to hold the indemnitee harmless is only recoverable out of MSC Income Fund s net assets and not from MSC Income Fund s stockholders. 
 4. Co-Investment 
 In the ordinary course of business, MSC Income Fund enters into transactions with other parties that may be considered related party transactions. MSC Income Fund has implemented certain policies and procedures, both written and unwritten, to ensure that it does not engage in any prohibited transactions with any persons affiliated with MSC Income Fund. If such affiliations are found to exist, MSC Income Fund seeks the Board of Directors and/or appropriate Board of Directors committee review and approval for such transactions and otherwise comply with, or seek, orders for exemptive relief from the SEC, as appropriate. 
 MSC Income Fund has received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting co-investments among MSC Income Fund, Main Street and other funds and clients advised by the Adviser in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act. MSC Income Fund has made co-investments, and in the future intends to continue to make co-investments with Main Street and other funds and clients advised by the Adviser, in accordance with the conditions of the order. The order requires, among other things, that the Adviser and Main Street consider whether each such investment opportunity is appropriate for MSC Income Fund, Main Street and the other funds and clients advised by the Adviser, as applicable, and if it is appropriate, to propose an allocation of the investment opportunity between such parties. Because the Adviser is wholly-owned by Main Street and is not managing MSC Income Fund s investment activities as its sole activity, this may provide the Adviser an incentive to allocate opportunities to other participating funds and clients instead of MSC Income Fund. However, the Adviser has policies and procedures in place to manage this conflict, including oversight by the independent members of the Board of Directors. Additional information regarding the operation of the co-investment program is set forth in the order granting exemptive relief, which may be reviewed on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. In addition to the co-investment program described above, MSC Income Fund also co-invests in syndicated deals and other transactions where price is the only negotiated point by MSC Income Fund and its affiliates.

 As of September 30, 2024 Private Loan LMM (a) Middle Market (dollars in millions) Number of portfolio companies 84 55 11 Fair value 679.9 411.0 46.1 Cost 700.0 340.5 73.0 Debt investments as a of portfolio (at cost) 95.6 70.8 88.9 Equity investments as a of portfolio (at cost) 4.4 29.2 11.1 of debt investments at cost secured by first priority lien 99.9 99.9 99.9 Weighted-average annual effective yield (b) 12.7 13.2 14.1 Average EBITDA (c) 33.2 10.0 44.3 
 __________________ 
 (a) As of September 30, 2024, we had equity ownership in all of our LMM portfolio companies, and the average fully diluted equity ownership in those portfolio companies was 9 . 
 (b) The weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments as of September 30, 2024, including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on non-accrual status, and are weighted based upon the principal amount of each applicable debt investment as of September 30, 2024. The weighted-average annual effective yield on our debt portfolio as of September 30, 2024 including debt investments on non-accrual status was 12.1 for our Private Loan portfolio, 11.8 for our LMM portfolio and 9.4 for our Middle Market portfolio. The weighted-average annual effective yield is not reflective of what an investor in shares of our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect our utilization of debt capital in our capital structure, our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. 
 (c) The average EBITDA is calculated using a weighted-average for the Private Loan and Middle Market portfolios and a simple average for the LMM portfolio. These calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including two Private Loan portfolio companies, two LMM portfolio companies and one Middle Market portfolio company, as EBITDA is not a meaningful valuation metric for our investments in these portfolio companies, and those portfolio companies whose primary purpose is to own real estate and those portfolio companies whose primary operations have ceased and only residual value remains. 
 As of December 31, 2023 Private Loan LMM (a) Middle Market (dollars in millions) Number of portfolio companies 78 50 16 Fair value 595.3 387.0 86.0 Cost 586.4 315.7 114.7 Debt investments as a of portfolio (at cost) 94.1 70.2 93.1 Equity investments as a of portfolio (at cost) 5.9 29.8 6.9 of debt investments at cost secured by first priority lien 100.0 99.9 100.0 Weighted-average annual effective yield (b) 13.1 13.0 13.0 Average EBITDA (c) 30.5 8.8 74.2

 (b) The weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments as of December 31, 2023, including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on non-accrual status, and are weighted based upon the principal amount of each applicable debt investment as of December 31, 2023. The weighted-average annual effective yield on our debt portfolio as of December 31, 2023 including debt investments on non-accrual status was 12.6 for our Private Loan portfolio, 13.0 for our LMM portfolio and 9.9 for our Middle Market portfolio. The weighted-average annual effective yield is not reflective of what an investor in shares of our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect our utilization of debt capital in our capital structure, our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. 
 (c) The average EBITDA is calculated using a weighted-average for the Private Loan and Middle Market portfolios and a simple average for the LMM portfolio. These calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including one Private Loan portfolio company, as EBITDA is not a meaningful valuation metric for our investment in this portfolio company, and those portfolio companies whose primary purpose is to own real estate. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we achieved an annualized total return on investments of 10.5 and 12.0 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we achieved an annualized total return on investments of 12.4 and 12.9 , respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we achieved a total return on investments of 13.6 . Total return on investments is calculated using the interest, dividend and fee income, as well as the realized and unrealized change in fair value of the Investment Portfolio for the specified period. Our total return on investments is not reflective of what an investor in shares of our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect our utilization of debt capital in our capital structure, our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had Other Portfolio investments in six entities, spread across four investment managers, collectively totaling 25.7 million in fair value and 19.1 million in cost basis and which comprised 2.2 and 1.7 of our Investment Portfolio at fair value and cost, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had Other Portfolio investments in six entities, spread across four investment managers, collectively totaling 24.6 million in fair value and 21.5 million in cost basis and which comprised 2.3 and 2.1 of our Investment Portfolio at fair value and cost, respectively. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on our current and future financial condition and results of operations. 
 Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting policy and estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include the Investment Portfolio Valuation and Revenue Recognition policies described below. Our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note B Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Investment Portfolio Valuation 
 The most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our Investment Portfolio and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation. We consider this determination to be a critical accounting estimate, given the significant judgments and subjective measurements required. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Investment Portfolio valued at fair value represented 95 and 96 , respectively, of our total assets. We are required to report our investments at fair value. We follow the provisions of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact. See Note B.1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Valuation of the Investment Portfolio

 included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed discussion of our Investment Portfolio valuation process and procedures. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our determination of fair value for our Investment Portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 
 Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act permits a BDC s board of directors to designate its executive officers or investment adviser as a valuation designee to determine the fair value for its investment portfolio, subject to the active oversight of the board. Our Board of Directors has approved policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 2a-5 (the Valuation Procedures and has designated our Adviser, led by a group of Main Street s and our Adviser s executive officers, to serve as the Board of Directors valuation designee. We believe our Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximates fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 We record interest and dividend income on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. We evaluate accrued interest and dividend income periodically for collectability. When a loan or debt security becomes 90 days or more past due, and if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service its debt obligation, we will generally place the loan or debt security on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a loan or debt security s status significantly improves regarding the debtor s ability to service the debt obligation, or if a loan or debt security is sold or written off, we remove it from non-accrual status. 
 Fee Income 
 We may periodically provide services, including structuring and advisory services to our portfolio companies or other third parties. For services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value, fee income is recognized as earned, which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes. Fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are generally deferred and accreted into income over the life of the financing. 
 Payment-in-Kind PIK Interest and Cumulative Dividends 
 We hold certain debt and preferred equity instruments in our Investment Portfolio that contain PIK interest and cumulative dividend provisions. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. Cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income, and any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of the preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed or sold. To maintain RIC tax treatment (as discussed in Note B.7. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Income Taxes included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), these non-cash sources of income may need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions, even though we may not have collected the PIK interest and cumulative dividends in cash. We stop accruing PIK interest and cumulative dividends and write off any accrued and uncollected interest and dividends in arrears when we determine that such PIK interest and dividends in arrears are no longer collectible. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, (i) 6.7 and 4.6 , respectively, of our total investment income was attributable to PIK interest income not paid currently in cash and (ii) 0.1 of our total investment income in each period was attributable to cumulative dividend income not paid currently in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, (i) 5.4 and 3.9 , respectively, of our total investment income was attributable to PIK interest income not paid currently in cash and (ii) 0.1 of our total investment income in each period was attributable to cumulative dividend income not paid currently in cash.

 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION 
 The following tables summarize the composition of our total combined Private Loan, LMM and Middle Market portfolio investments at cost and fair value by type of investment as a percentage of the total combined Private Loan, LMM and Middle Market portfolio investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (this information excludes Other Portfolio investments). 
 Cost: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 First lien debt 87.6 86.5 Equity 12.1 13.3 Equity warrants 0.3 0.2 100.0 100.0

 Our Private Loan, LMM and Middle Market portfolio investments carry a number of risks including: (1) investing in companies which may have limited operating histories and financial resources; (2) holding investments that generally are not publicly traded and which may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale; and (3) other risks common to investing in below investment-grade debt and equity investments in our Investment Portfolio. Please see I tem 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to our Investments contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a more complete discussion of the risks involved with investing in our Investment Portfolio. 
 
 PORTFOLIO ASSET QUALITY 
 Our Adviser utilizes an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of each Private Loan, LMM and Middle Market portfolio company and to monitor our expected level of returns on each of our Private Loan, LMM and Middle Market investments in relation to our expectations for the portfolio company. The investment rating system takes into consideration various factors, including, but not limited to, each investment s expected level of returns, the collectability of our debt investments and the ability to receive a return of the invested capital in our equity investments, comparisons to competitors and other industry participants, the portfolio company s future outlook and other factors that are deemed to be significant to the portfolio company. 
 As of September 30, 2024, investments on non-accrual status comprised 2.6 of our total Investment Portfolio at fair value and 6.5 at cost. As of December 31, 2023, investments on non-accrual status comprised 1.1 of our total Investment Portfolio at fair value and 4.0 at cost. 
 The operating results of our portfolio companies are impacted by changes in the broader fundamentals of the United States economy. In periods during which the United States economy contracts, it is likely that the financial results of small to mid-sized companies, like those in which we invest, could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels, which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements, to an increase in defaults on our debt investments or in realized losses on our investments and to difficulty in maintaining historical dividend payment rates and unrealized appreciation on our equity investments. Consequently, we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by future economic cycles or other conditions, which could also have a negative impact on our future results.

 (a) The increase in interest expense was primarily related to an increase in average borrowings on our floating rate multi-year revolving Credit Facilities (as defined below in Liquidity and Capital Resources to fund the growth of our Investment Portfolio. 
 (b) The decrease in incentive fees was due to the decreased Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income resulting from our less favorable operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period prior year. 
 Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively unchanged at 14.2 million, or 0.18 per share, compared to net investment income of 14.1 million, or 0.18 per share, for the corresponding period of 2023. The slight increase in net investment income was principally attributable to the increase in total investment income, partially offset by the increase in total expenses, as discussed above. Net investment income per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included an insignificant change from income considered less consistent or non-recurring in nature when compared to the prior year.

 Income Tax Benefit (Provision) 
 The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 6.2 million principally consisted of (i) a deferred tax provision of 3.6 million, which is primarily the result of the net activity relating to our portfolio investments held in our Taxable Subsidiaries, including changes in loss carryforwards, changes in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation and other temporary book-tax differences and (ii) a current tax provision of 2.5 million related to a 2.0 million provision for current federal and state income taxes and a 0.5 million provision for excise tax on our estimated undistributed taxable income. 
 The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 3.2 million consisted of (i) a deferred tax provision of 2.2 million, which is primarily the result of the net activity relating to our portfolio investments held in our Taxable Subsidiaries, including changes in loss carryforwards, changes in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation and other temporary book-tax differences and (ii) a current tax provision of 1.0 million related to a 0.6 million provision for current federal and state income taxes and a 0.4 million provision for excise tax on our estimated undistributed taxable income. 
 Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 The net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.1 million, or 0.45 per share, compared with 44.9 million, or 0.56 per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tables above provide a summary of the reasons for the change in net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we realized a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 18.1 million as the result of 13.4 million of cash used in our operating activities, partially offset by 31.5 million of cash provided by our financing activities. 
 The 13.4 million of cash used in our operating activities resulted primarily from (i) the funding of new portfolio investments of 253.9 million and (ii) 0.9 million in cash flows related to changes in other assets and liabilities, partially offset by (i) cash proceeds totaling 209.5 million from the sales and repayments of debt investments and sales of and return of capital from equity investments and (ii) cash flows that we generated from the operating profits earned totaling 34.5 million, which is our net investment income, excluding the non-cash effects of the accretion of unearned income, payment-in-kind interest income, cumulative dividends and the amortization expense for deferred financing costs. 
 The 31.5 million of cash provided by our financing activities principally consisted of (i) 71.0 million net cash borrowings related to our Credit Facilities and (ii) 7.0 million cash proceeds related to common stock issuance, partially offset by (i) 29.7 million in cash dividends paid to stockholders and (ii) 16.8 million for the repurchases of our common stock. 
 Share Repurchases 
 We maintain a share repurchase program whereby we make quarterly offers to purchase shares at the estimated NAV per share, as determined within 48 hours prior to the repurchase date. The amount of shares of our common stock to be repurchased during any calendar quarter may be equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares of common stock we could repurchase with the proceeds we received from the issuance of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan (the DRIP or (ii) 2.5 of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding in the prior four calendar quarters. Repurchase offers are currently limited to the number of shares of our common stock we can repurchase with 90 of the cash retained as a result of issuances of common stock under the DRIP. 
 
 On February 5, 2024, we commenced a 2.5 million modified Dutch Auction tender offer (the February 2024 Dutch Auction Tender Offer pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, dated February 5, 2024, which expired on March 4, 2024. 
 On May 17, 2024, we commenced a 2.0 million modified Dutch Auction tender offer (the May 2024 Dutch Auction Tender Offer pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, dated May 17, 2024, which expired on June 20, 2024. 
 See Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 48.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and 58.3 million of unused capacity under the Credit Facilities, which we maintain to support our investment and operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, our NAV totaled 618.5 million, or 7.69 per share. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 147.0 million outstanding and 18.0 million of undrawn commitments under our floating rate multi-year revolving credit facility (the Corporate Facility and 259.7 million outstanding and 40.3 million of undrawn commitments under our special purpose vehicle revolving credit facility (the SPV Facility and, together with the Corporate Facility, the Credit Facilities ), both of which we estimated approximated fair value. Availability under our Credit Facilities is subject to certain leverage and borrowing base limitations, various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. For further information on our Credit Facilities, including key terms and financial covenants, refer to Note D Debt included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We closed our continuous follow-on public offering of shares to new investors effective September 2017. As such, our ability to raise additional equity is limited. 
 As a BDC, we generally are required to maintain a coverage ratio, or BDC asset coverage ratio, of total assets to total senior securities, which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200 (or 
 109 

Table of contents 

 150 if certain requirements are met in the future). This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. As of September 30, 2024, our BDC asset coverage ratio was 211 . The combination of these factors limits our access to capital to fund future investment activities or operating requirements, including our ability to grow the Investment Portfolio. We anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities and operating requirements through existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated through our ongoing operating activities, including cash proceeds from the repayments and from the sales of investments in our portfolio companies, and utilization of available borrowings under our Credit Facilities. Our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, operating expenses, cash distributions to holders of our common stock and share repurchases under our share repurchase programs. 
 We periodically invest excess cash balances into marketable securities and idle funds investments. The primary investment objective of marketable securities and idle funds investments is to generate incremental cash returns on excess cash balances prior to utilizing those funds for investment in our Private Loan and LMM portfolio investments. Marketable securities and idle funds investments generally consist of money market funds and certificates of deposit with financial institutions. 
 In order to satisfy the Code requirements applicable to a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders, after consideration and application of our ability under the Code to carry forward certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year, substantially all of our taxable income. 
 Although we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity, including through the Credit Facilities and the Note Purchase Agreement, there is no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms, or at all. 
 Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued standards and any that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. For a description of recently issued or adopted accounting standards, see Note B.11. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Inflation 
 Inflation has not historically had a significant effect on our results of operations in any of the reporting periods presented herein. However, our portfolio companies have experienced, specifically including over the last few years, as a result of recent geopolitical events, supply chain and labor issues, and may continue to experience, the increasing impacts of inflation on their operating results, including periodic escalations in their costs for labor, raw materials and third-party services and required energy consumption. These issues and challenges related to inflation are receiving significant attention from our investment teams and the management teams of our portfolio companies as we work to manage these growing challenges. Prolonged or more severe impacts of inflation to our portfolio companies could continue to affect their operating profits and, thereby, increase their borrowing costs, and as a result negatively impact their ability to service their debt obligations and/or reduce their available cash for distributions. In addition, these factors could have a negative effect on the fair value of our investments in these portfolio companies. The combined impacts therefrom in turn could negatively affect our results of operations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments include commitments to extend credit and fund equity capital and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 73.5 million in outstanding commitments comprised of (i) 69 commitments to fund revolving loans that had not been fully drawn or term loans with additional commitments not yet funded and (ii) two equity capital commitments that had not been fully called. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 556.7 million in total borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facilities and Series A Notes. The Corporate Facility was scheduled to mature on March 1, 2026. See Note K Subsequent Events included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details on the related

 amendment. The SPV Facility will mature on February 3, 2028. The Series A Notes will mature on October 30, 2026. See further discussion of the terms of our Credit Facilities, Series A Notes and other debt in Note D Debt included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total (dollars in thousands) SPV Facility (1)

 _________________ 
 (1) As of September 30, 2024, 40.3 million remained available to borrow under the SPV Facility; however, our borrowing ability is limited to leverage and borrowing base restrictions imposed by the SPV Facility and the 1940 Act, as discussed above. 
 (2) As of September 30, 2024, 18.0 million remained available to borrow under the Corporate Facility; however, our borrowing ability is limited to leverage and borrowing base restrictions imposed by the Corporate Facility and the 1940 Act, as discussed above. 
 Related Party Transactions and Agreements 
 We have entered into agreements with our Adviser and/or certain of its affiliates and other parties whereby we pay certain fees and reimbursements to these entities. These included payments for selling commissions and fees and for reimbursement of offering costs. In addition, we make payments for certain services that include the identification, execution and management of our investments and also the management of our day-to-day operations provided to us by our Adviser, pursuant to various agreements that we have entered into. See Note J Related Party Transactions included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding these related party transactions and agreements. 
 Recent Developments 
 On November 1, 2024, we repurchased 512,730 shares of our common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn on the terms set forth in the tender offer statement on Schedule TO and Offer to Purchase filed with the SEC on September 26, 2024. We repurchased the shares at a price of 7.74 per share, which was our NAV per share as of November 1, 2024, for an aggregate purchase price of 4.0 million (an amount equal to 90 of the proceeds we received from the issuance of shares under our DRIP from the November 1, 2024 dividend payment). 
 On November 8, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Corporate Facility to, among other things: (i) extend the revolving period from September 2025 to November 2028, (ii) extend the final maturity date from March 2026 to May 2029 and (iii) reduce the interest rate, subject to our election to (a) SOFR plus 2.05 or (b) the base rate plus 1.05 . 
 On November 13, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.18 per share payable on January 31, 2025 to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2024. 
 
 We have scheduled a special meeting of stockholders on December 2, 2024 to consider a series of proposals that we believe will position us to potentially effect a listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange) (a Listing if and when market conditions make it desirable to do so and it is otherwise in our best interest. On November 13, 2024, our Board of directors, including the independent directors, unanimously approved suspending our share repurchase program in anticipation of a Listing and the opportunity for enhanced liquidity a Listing is expected to provide our stockholders. The share repurchase program will ultimately terminate upon a Listing.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, and changes in interest rates may affect both our interest expense on the debt outstanding under our Credit Facilities and our interest income from portfolio investments. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rate indices, including SOFR and Prime rates, to the extent that any debt investments include floating interest rates. See Risk Factors Risks Related to our Business and Structure We are subject to risks associated with the interest rate environment and changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital, net investment income and the value of our investments. and Risk Factors Risks Related to Leverage Because we borrow money, the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for more information regarding risks associated with our debt investments and borrowings that utilize SOFR or Prime as a reference rate. 
 The majority of our debt investments are made with either fixed interest rates or floating rates that are subject to contractual minimum interest rates for the term of the investment. As of September 30, 2024, 77 of our debt Investment Portfolio (at cost) bore interest at floating rates, 96 of which were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 27 of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed rates. Our interest expense will be affected by changes in the published SOFR rate in connection with our Credit Facilities; however, the interest rates on our outstanding Series A Notes are fixed for the life of such debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements. Due to our limited use of derivatives, we have claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act and, therefore, are not subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under such Act. The Company expects to operate as a limited derivatives user under Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act.

Table of contents 

 The following table shows the approximate annualized increase or decrease in the components of net investment income due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investments and borrowings as of September 30, 2024. The pro forma changes in incentive fee expense are calculated based upon the actual incentive fee expense for the third quarter of 2024 on an annualized basis, as adjusted for the pro forma changes in Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income. 
 Basis Point Change Increase (Decrease) in Interest Income (Increase) Decrease in Interest Expense Increase (Decrease) in Pre Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (Increase) Decrease in Incentive Fee Expense Increase (Decrease) in Net Investment Income Increase (Decrease) in Net Investment Income per Share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) (200) (14,441) 8,134 (6,307) 6,307 (175) (12,616) 7,117 (5,499) 5,499 (150) (10,810) 6,100 (4,710) 4,710 (125) (9,004) 5,084 (3,920) 3,920 (100) (7,197) 4,067 (3,130) 3,130 (75) (5,394) 3,050 (2,344) 2,344 (50) (3,596) 2,033 (1,563) 1,563 (25) (1,798) 1,017 (781) 781 25 1,798 (1,017) 781 (781) 50 3,598 (2,033) 1,565 (1,565) 75 5,399 (3,050) 2,349 (2,349) 100 7,201 (4,067) 3,134 (3,134) 125 9,002 (5,084) 3,918 (3,918) 150 10,804 (6,100) 4,704 (4,704) 175 12,605 (7,117) 5,488 (5,488) 200 14,407 (8,134) 6,273 (5,765) 508 0.01 
 Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of the impact of interest rate changes to our Net Investment Income as of September 30, 2024, the analysis does not take into consideration future changes in the credit market, credit quality, or other business or economic developments that could affect our Net Investment Income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. The hypothetical results assume that all SOFR and Prime rate changes would be effective on the first day of the period. However, the contractual SOFR and Prime rate reset dates would vary throughout the period. The majority of our investments are based on contracts which reset quarterly while our Corporate Facility and our SPV Facility reset on a monthly and quarterly basis, respectively. The hypothetical results would also be impacted by the changes in the amount of debt outstanding under our Credit Facilities (with an increase (decrease) in the debt outstanding under the Credit Facilities resulting in an (increase) decrease in the hypothetical interest expense). 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
