 Certain statements in this "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (this "Quarterly Report"), other than purely historical information, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). These statements include statements about InvenTrust Properties Corp.'s (the "Company," "InvenTrust," "we," "our," or "us") plans, objectives, strategies, financial performance and outlook, trends, the amount and timing of future cash distributions, prospects or future events; and they involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict. 
 As a result, our actual financial results, performance, achievements, or prospects may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "may," "could," "expect," "intend," "plan," "seek," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "guidance," "predict," "potential," "continue," "likely," "will," "would," "illustrative," and "should" and variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negatives of these terms or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while we consider reasonable based on our knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, are inherently uncertain.

 Overview 
 Strategy and Outlook 
 InvenTrust Properties Corp. is a premier Sun Belt, multi-tenant essential retail REIT that owns, leases, redevelops, acquires, and manages grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, as well as high-quality power centers that often have a grocery component. We pursue our business strategy by acquiring retail properties in Sun Belt markets, opportunistically disposing of retail properties, maintaining a flexible capital structure, and enhancing our environmental, social and governance practices and standards. 
 InvenTrust focuses on Sun Belt markets with favorable demographics, including above average growth in population, employment, income and education levels. We believe these conditions create favorable demand characteristics for grocery-anchored and necessity-based essential retail centers, which will position us to capitalize on potential future rent increases while benefiting from sustained occupancy at our centers. Our strategically located regional field offices are within a two-hour drive of over 95 of our properties which affords us the ability to respond to the needs of our tenants and provides us with in-depth local market knowledge. We believe that our Sun Belt portfolio of high quality grocery-anchored assets is a distinct differentiator for us in the marketplace. 
 Evaluation of Financial Condition 
 In addition to measures of operating performance determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management evaluates our financial condition and operating performance by focusing on the following financial and nonfinancial indicators, discussed in further detail herein: 
 Net Operating Income ("NOI") and Same Property NOI, supplemental non-GAAP measures; 
 Nareit Funds From Operations ("Nareit FFO") Applicable to Common Shares and Dilutive Securities, a supplemental non-GAAP measure; 
 Core Funds From Operations ("Core FFO") Applicable to Common Shares and Dilutive Securities, a supplemental non-GAAP measure; 
 Economic and leased occupancy and rental rates; 
 Leasing activity and lease rollover; 
 Operating expense levels and trends; 
 General and administrative expense levels and trends; 
 Debt maturities and leverage ratios; and 
 Liquidity levels.

 Our Retail Portfolio 
 Our wholly-owned and managed retail properties include grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers and power centers, including those classified as necessity-based, as defined in our Annual Report. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 65 retail properties with a total gross leasable area ("GLA") of approximately 10.6 million square feet. The following table summarizes our retail portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 2024 2023 No. of properties 65 62 GLA (square feet) 10,550 10,324 Economic occupancy (a) 94.2 92.6 Leased occupancy (b) 97.0 95.1 ABR PSF (c) 19.83 19.36 
 (a) Economic occupancy is defined as the percentage of occupied GLA divided by total GLA (excluding Specialty Leases) for which a tenant is obligated to pay rent under the terms of its lease agreement as of the rent commencement date, regardless of the actual use or occupancy by that tenant of the area being leased. Actual use may be less than economic occupancy. Specialty Leases represent small shop and anchor leases with terms of less than one year and all common area leases regardless of term. 
 (b) Leased occupancy is defined as economic occupancy plus the percentage of signed but not yet commenced GLA divided by total GLA. 
 (c) Annualized Base Rent ("ABR") is computed as base rent for the period multiplied by twelve months. Base rent is inclusive of ground rent and any abatement concessions, but excludes Specialty Lease rent. ABR per square foot ("PSF") is computed as ABR divided by the occupied square footage as of the end of the period. 
 Summary by Center Type 
 The following table summarizes our retail portfolio by center type, as defined in our Annual Report, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. Community and Neighborhood centers Power centers 2024 2023 2024 2023 No. of properties 53 50 12 12 GLA (square feet) 7,025 6,800 3,525 3,524 Economic occupancy 95.6 93.5 91.3 90.7 Leased occupancy 97.0 96.5 96.8 92.4 ABR PSF 20.54 20.14 18.34 17.80

Summary by Same Property 
 Properties classified as same property were owned for the entirety of both periods presented ("Same Properties"). The following table summarizes the Same Properties of our retail portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 No. of properties 62 62 57 57 GLA (square feet) 10,324 10,324 9,109 9,108 Economic occupancy 94.1 92.6 94.3 92.8 Leased occupancy 96.9 95.1 97.2 95.3 ABR PSF 19.69 19.36 20.15 19.78 
 
 Lease Expirations 
 The following table presents the lease expirations of our retail portfolio as of September 30, 2024. This table does not include expirations of signed but not yet commenced leases, nor does it assume that unexercised contractual lease renewal or extension options contained in our leases will, in fact, be exercised. 
 Lease Expiration Year No. of Expiring Leases GLA of Expiring Leases (square feet) Percent of Total GLA of Expiring Leases ABR of Expiring Leases Percent of Total ABR Expiring ABR PSF (a) 2024 18 39 0.4 1,213 0.6 31.10 2025 148 808 8.1 14,424 6.9 17.85 2026 218 941 9.5 22,478 10.7 23.89 2027 280 1,932 19.5 39,907 18.8 20.66 2028 231 1,061 10.7 26,018 12.4 24.52 2029 217 1,421 14.3 30,547 14.5 21.50 2030 106 756 7.6 16,232 7.7 21.47 2031 83 571 5.7 11,949 5.7 20.93 2032 88 538 5.4 12,245 5.8 22.76 2033 62 390 3.9 10,045 4.8 25.76 Thereafter 104 1,468 14.8 25,119 11.9 17.11 Other (b) 6 11 0.1 362 0.2 32.91 1,561 9,936 100 210,539 100 21.19 
 (a) Expiring ABR PSF reflects ABR PSF at the time of lease expiration. 
 (b) Other lease expirations include the GLA, ABR and ABR PSF of month-to-month leases. 
 Our retail business is neither highly dependent on specific retailers nor subject to lease roll-over concentration. We believe this minimizes risk to our retail portfolio from significant revenue variances over time.

Net Operating Income 
 We evaluate the performance of our retail properties based on NOI, which excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, other income and expense, net, i mpairment of real estate assets, gains (losses) from sales of properties, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, interest expense, net, equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated entities, lease termination income and expense, and GAAP rent adjustments such as amortization of market lease intangibles, amortization of lease incentives, and straight-line rent adjustments ("GAAP Rent Adjustments"). We bifurcate NOI into Same Property NOI and NOI from other investment properties based on whether the retail properties meet our Same Property criteria. NOI from other investment properties includes adjustments for the Company's captive insurance company. 
 We believe the supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of NOI, and the bifurcation into same property NOI and NOI from other investment properties, provides added comparability across periods when evaluating our financial condition and operating performance that is not readily apparent from "Operating income" or "Net income" in accordance with GAAP. 
 Comparison of Same Property results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 A total of 62 and 57 retail properties met our Same Property criteria for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table presents the reconciliation of net income or loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NOI and Same Property NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Funds From Operations 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("Nareit"), an industry trade group, has promulgated a widely accepted non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance known as Funds From Operations ("FFO"). Our Nareit FFO is net income (or loss) in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) resulting from dispositions of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real property. Adjustments for IAGM are calculated to reflect our proportionate share of the joint venture's funds from operations on the same basis. 
 Core FFO is an additional supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance. In particular, Core FFO provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different REITs without having to account for certain remaining amortization assumptions within Nareit FFO and other unique revenue and expense items, which some may consider not pertinent to measuring a particular company's on-going operating performance. In that regard, we use Core FFO as an input to our compensation plan to determine cash bonuses and measure the achievement of certain performance-based equity awards.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capital Investments and Leasing Costs 
 Operating our properties generally results in paying leasing commissions and making capital investments, including value-enhancing development projects and redevelopment projects. 
 The following table summarizes the capital resources used for capital investments and leasing costs on a cash basis: 
 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 Tenant improvements 7,936 5,687 Leasing costs 2,632 2,518 Property improvements 6,652 13,626 Capitalized indirect costs (a) 1,178 1,318 Total capital expenditures and leasing costs 18,398 23,149 Development and redevelopment direct costs 6,410 2,510 Development and redevelopment indirect costs (a) 804 650 Capital investments and leasing costs (b) 25,612 26,309 
 (a) Indirect costs include capitalized interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and payroll costs. 
 (b) As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, total accrued capital investments and leasing costs were 5,008 and 3,836, respectively. 

Short-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On a short-term basis, our principal uses for funds are to pay our operating and corporate expenses, interest and principal on our indebtedness, property capital expenditures, and to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors, including our revenue, macroeconomic conditions, our ability to contain costs, including capital expenditures, and to collect rents and other receivables, and various other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may seek to raise funds through debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations, significant investments or acquisitions that are consistent with our strategy. Our ability to raise these funds may also be diminished by other macroeconomic factors. 
 Long-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our objectives are to maximize revenue generated by our retail platform, to further enhance the value of our retail properties to produce attractive current yield and long-term returns for our stockholders, and to generate sustainable and predictable cash flow from our operations to distribute to our stockholders. 
 Any future determination to pay distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors (the "Board") and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments, and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. 
 Capital Sources and Uses 
 Our primary sources and uses of capital are as follows: 
 Sources Uses Operating cash flows from our real estate investments; 
 Proceeds from sales of properties; 
 Proceeds from mortgage loan borrowings on properties; 
 Proceeds from corporate borrowings and debt financings; 
 Proceeds from any ATM Program activities or other equity offerings; and 
 Proceeds from our Series A Notes and Series B Notes. 
 To invest in properties or fund acquisitions; 
 To fund development, re-development, maintenance and capital expenditures or leasing incentives; 
 To make distributions to our stockholders; 
 To service or pay down our debt; 
 To pay our operating expenses; 
 To repurchase shares of our common stock; and 
 To fund other general corporate uses. 

27 

In the first quarter of 2022, we established an at-the-market equity offering program (the "ATM Program") pursuant to which we may sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate purchase price of 250.0 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no shares were issued under the ATM Program. As of September 30, 2024, 244.6 million of common stock remains available for issuance under the ATM Program. 
 On September 25, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock at a price to the public of 28.00 per share. We issued and sold 9,200,000 shares of common stock, including 1,200,000 shares issued in connection with the full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. We received 247.3 million of net proceeds, after deducting 10.3 million in underwriting discounts and commissions. 
 We believe our status as an NYSE-listed issuer will facilitate supplementing our capital sources by selling equity securities of the Company under the ATM Program or otherwise if and when we believe appropriate to do so. Also, from time to time, we may seek to acquire amounts of our outstanding common stock through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities. Such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. At this time, we believe our current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our short- and long-term cash demands. 
 
 Distributions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared distributions to our stockholders totaling 48.2 million and paid cash distributions of 45.3 million. As we execute on our retail strategy and continue to evaluate our business, results of operations and cash flows, our Board will continue to evaluate our distribution on a periodic basis. 
 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 Nine months ended September 30 Change 2024 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 99,892 99,803 89 Cash used in investing activities (108,281) (76,178) (32,103) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 111,384 (57,276) 168,660 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 102,995 (33,651) 136,646 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 99,763 137,762 (37,999) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 202,758 104,111 98,647 
 Cash provided by operating activities of 99.9 million and 99.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was generated primarily from income from property operations. Cash provided by operating activities decreased 0.1 million when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023, as a result of general working capital fluctuations. Since January 1, 2023, we have acquired eight retail properties and disposed of one. 
 Cash used in investing activities of 108.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of: 
 83.0 million for acquisitions of investment properties, and 
 25.8 million for capital investments, leasing costs, and other investing activities, which were partially offset by: 
 0.5 million in net proceeds received from the sale of investment properties. 
 Cash used in investing activities of 76.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of: 
 152.0 million for acquisitions of investment properties, and 
 28.2 million for capital investments and leasing costs, which were partially offset by cash provided by: 
 12.6 million in net proceeds received from the sale of investment properties, and 
 91.4 million for distributions from unconsolidated entities. 
 28 

Cash provided by financing activities of 111.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of: 
 247.3 million in net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and 
 0.3 million in net proceeds from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), which were partially offset by: 
 1.5 million for additional costs incurred in relation to sales of our common stock, 
 45.3 million to pay distributions, 
 1.2 million for the payment of tax withholdings for share-based compensation, and 
 88.2 million for pay-offs of debt and other financing activities. 
 Cash used in financing activities of 57.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of: 
 42.9 million to pay distributions, and 
 14.4 million for pay-offs of debt and other financing activities. 
 We consider all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements with a maturity of three months or less, at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at major financial institutions. The combined account balances at one or more institutions generally exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance coverage. We periodically assess the credit risk associated with these financial institutions. We believe insignificant credit risk exists related to deposits in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 None. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have obligations related to our mortgage loans, senior notes, term loans, and revolving credit facility as described in "Note 7. Debt" in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 The following table presents our obligations to make future payments under debt and lease agreements as of September 30, 2024, exclusive of debt discounts and issuance costs, which are not future cash obligations.

 (b) Includes leases on corporate office spaces.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company bases these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates described in our "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" set forth in our Annual Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates both in terms of variable-rate debt and the price of new fixed-rate debt upon maturity of existing debt. The Company's interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's debt included outstanding variable-rate debt of 400.0 million, all of which has been swapped to a fixed rate. 
 On March 16, 2023, the Company entered into one interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 100.0 million at 3.69 , achieving a fixed interest rate of 4.99 . As of the effective date of April 3, 2023, the entirety of the Company's variable rate term loans were swapped to fixed rates through the maturity dates of its 400.0 million term loan credit agreement ("the Amended Term Loan Agreement"). 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company is party to five effective interest rate swap agreements which achieve fixed interest rates through the maturity dates of the Amended Term Loan Agreement. 
 The following table summarizes the Company's interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Gains or losses resulting from marking-to-market derivatives each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in comprehensive income on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. 
 The information presented above does not consider all exposures or positions that could arise in the future. Therefore, the information represented herein has limited predictive value. As a result, the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, the hedging strategies at the time, and the related interest rates.
