 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data) 
 (unaudited) 

As of September 30, 2024 , the Credit Parties were not in compliance with their financial covenants under the SLR Credit Agreement, which the Borrower had to report by October 31, 2024, and which would have resulted in an event of default. The Credit Parties then entered into a letter agreement on October 30, 2024 pursuant to which SLR extended the deadline for delivery of the compliance certificate required for the fiscal month ended September 30, 2024 , and the related notice of event of default, to November 19, 2024. 
 
 On November 15, 2024, the Credit Parties and SLR entered into the Third Amendment (as defined and discussed in Note 5 to the SLR Credit A greement, which, among other things, required that the Company raise at least 7,500 of additional capital by November 29, 2024 . In addition, the Third Amendment waived non-compliance with the financial covenants as of September 30, 2024 , extended the duration of the call protection applicable to the loans, and modified the cash dominion provisions to remain in effect on an indefinite basis. The Company will seek to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked, or subordinated debt financings; however, whether and when the Company can effect such financings and how much capital it can raise depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Company s common stock and the Company s determination as to the appropriate sources of funding for its operations. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available by November 29, 2024. 
 
 Additionally, given the continued challenges the Company has faced achieving profitability, the Company made a reduction in workforce during the second quarter of 2024 and continues to consider further cost reduction measures and focus resources on opportunities that will enable the Company to meet its projected budget and cash flow requirements. Initial measures included divesting a non-core business unit (see Note 12 , Variable Interest Entity ), transferring another business unit (see Note 3 , Intangible assets, net ), and reviewing additional other business units to determine the impact of potential divestments. 
 
 Based on current projections, the Company expects to be in compliance with the new financial covenants for each of the quarters in the twelve months following the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q. However, the Company has not met its projections for certain recent quarters, so there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its projections in the future. If during any fiscal quarter, the Credit Parties do not comply with any of their financial covenants, such non-compliance would result in an event of default that would give SLR the right to accelerate maturities. Additionally, if the Company fails to raise capital in at least the amount required under the Third Amendment by November 29, 2024, such failure would also result in an event of default. In such case, the Company would not have sufficient funds to repay the SLR Term Loan (as defined herein) and the SLR Revolver (as defined herein). In addition, even if the Company is able to raise additional capital as required by the Third Amendment , there is no assurance that such capital plus the available cash plus borrowing base on the SLR Revolver will be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months. If needed, the Company will consider implementing other cost-saving measures, but there is no guarantee that such plans would be successfully executed or have the expected benefits. As a result, management concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q. 
 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Principles of consolidation 
 
 The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant transactions among the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation. 
 
 , or and per share (basic and diluted), respectively, during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company assessed the impact of this out-of-period adjustment and concluded that it was not material to the financial statements previously issued for the interim period, and the cumulative adjustment is not expected to be material to the annual financial statements for 2024. The out-of-period adjustment is included in the Fluent operating segment. 

reverse split of the issued shares (the "Reverse Stock Split") of the Company's common stock. All historical share amounts disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q have been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, as fractional shares of Common Stock were rounded up to the nearest whole share. See Note 8 , Equity, for additional information. 

,
 , and
 , respectively. The majority of the deferred revenue balance as of 
 December 31, 2023 was recognized as revenue during the
 first quarter of
 2024 .

When there is a delay between the period in which revenue is recognized and when a customer invoice is issued, revenue is recognized, and the corresponding amounts are recorded as unbilled revenue within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 , December 31, 2023 , and December 31, 2022, unbilled revenue included in the Company's accounts receivable was , , and , respectively. In line with industry practice, the unbilled revenue balance is recorded based on the Company's internally tracked conversions, net of estimated variances between this amount and the amount tracked and subsequently confirmed by customers. Substantially all amounts included within the unbilled revenue balance are invoiced to customers within the month directly following the period of service. Historical estimates related to unbilled revenue have not differed materially from actual invoiced revenue. 
 
 Sales commissions are recorded at the time revenue is recognized and recorded in sales and marketing in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has elected to utilize a practical expedient to expense incremental costs incurred related to obtaining a contract. 

In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed. 
 
 Commission revenue 
 
 The Company, acting as the agent, recognizes commission revenue that it expects to receive from the insurance provider from the sale of certain of its health insurance policies, which includes the assumed automatic renewals of such policies once its performance obligation is satisfied. The Company considers its performance obligation related to commissions for both the initial policy sale and future renewals of the policy to be satisfied upon submission by the Company of the initial policy application. 
 
 The Company applies the practical expedient to estimate the commission revenue for each insurance policy by applying the use of the portfolio approach to policies grouped together by product type and period submitted for effectuation. 
 
 The commission revenue is variable based on a policy's estimated lifetime value ("LTV"), which is the amount of time the Company expects the policy will remain effective based on past trends, industry data, expectations as to future retention rates, and commission rates. Further, the Company considers the application of constraints to the LTV and only recognizes the amount of variable consideration believed probable to be received that will not be subject to a significant revenue reversal in the future. Based on this, the commission revenue is recorded upon satisfaction of the performance obligation, which is typically paid monthly by the insurance provider as the consumer renews and pays the insurance provider for the policy over the duration the consumer remains on the policy. 
 
 The Company reassesses the estimated LTV for the health insurance policies on a quarterly or as-needed basis. Adjustments to the LTV may result in an increase or decrease in revenue and the corresponding asset in the period the change is made. Due to the higher attrition of policies sold, the Company reassessed its estimated LTV for the health insurance policies by increasing the constraints applied to the amount of consideration deemed probable which led to a reduction of estimated LTV during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 

Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure describes a fair value hierarchy based on the following three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value: 
 
 Level 1 defined as observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets; 
 
 Level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 
 Level 3 defined as unobservable inputs, for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 

See Note 6 , Fair Value Measurements , for further details.

The gross amounts associated with software developed for internal use primarily represent capitalized costs of internally developed software. The amounts relating to acquired proprietary technology, customer relationships, trade names, domain names, databases, and non-competition agreements primarily represent the fair values of intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisition of Fluent, LLC, effective December 8, 2015; the acquisition of Q Interactive, LLC, effecti ve June 8, 2016; the acquisition of substantially all the assets of AdParlor Holdings, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, effective July 1, 2019 the "AdParlor Acquisition"); the acquisition of a interest in Winopoly, LLC, effective April 1, 2020; the acquisition of a interest in True North Loyalty, LLC, (the "True North Acquisition"), effective January 1, 2022 see Note 12 , Variable Interest Entity ); and the consolidation of TAPP Influencers Corp. ("TAPP") effective January 9, 2023 see Note 12 , Variable Interest Entity ). 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the effects of the expected decline in operations due to the impact of certain client relationships constituted a triggering event for the All Other reporting unit. The Company conducted an interim test of recoverability of its long-lived assets, which compared the projected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. The results of this approach indicated that this long-lived asset was not recoverable and required that an impairment loss related to its customer relationships be calculated. The Company determined that based on the facts and circumstances, the remaining balance was impaired and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of its customer relationship intangible of as of June 30, 2024 . 

The Company completed its quarterly triggering event assessment for the three months ended of September 30, 2024 and determined that no triggering event had occurred requiring further impairment assessment of its long-lived assets. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024 , the Company had recorded a impairment charge on its software developed for internal use which related to an immaterial business unit under the Fluent reporting unit that was disposed of as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Amortization expenses of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, are included in depreciation and amortization expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 , intangible assets with a carrying amount of , included in the gross amount of software developed for internal use, have not commenced amortization, as they are not ready for their intended use. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , estimated amortization expenses related to the Company's intangible assets for the remainder of 2024 and through 2029 and thereafter are as follows: 

2025 
 2026 
 2027 
 2028 
 2029 and thereafter 
 Total 

, which represented a decrease of from the balance as of December 31, 2023 due to a non-cash impairment charge recorded as of June 30, 2024. 
 
 In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill is to be assessed at least annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that its fair value exceeds the carrying value. The measurement date of the Company's annual goodwill impairment test had been set to October 1, but with no remaining goodwill for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 , the annual testing will not be performed. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the effects of the expected decline in operations due to the impact of certain client relationships constituted a triggering event for the All Other reporting unit. The Company conducted an interim test of the fair value of the All Other reporting unit's goodwill for potential impairment related to the triggering event. The Company applied solely the income approach to determine the fair value of the All Other reporting unit. The results of this approach indicated that the carrying value exceeded its fair value by 58 . The Company therefore concluded that the goodwill was impaired as of June 30, 2024 and recorded a non-cash impairment charge for its remaining balance of .

 On April 2, 2024, the Company repaid the aggregate principal amount of the term loan ("Citizens Term Loan") due on September 30, 2025, resulting in a loss due to the early extinguishment of debt of , which was recognized in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 New Credit Facility 
 
 On April 2, 2024, Fluent, LLC entered into the SLR Credit Agreement with certain of its subsidiaries and the Company, as guarantors, and SLR, as administrative agent, lead arranger and bookrunner, and each other lender from time to time party thereto. 
 
 The SLR Credit Agreement provides for a term loan (the "SLR Term Loan") and a revolving credit facility of up to (the "SLR Revolver" and together with the SLR Term Loan, the "SLR Credit Facility"). As of September 30, 2024 , the SLR Credit Facility had an outstanding principal balance of (of which relates to the SLR Revolver) and matures on April 2, 2029. 
 
 The Borrower used a portion of the net proceeds of the SLR Credit Facility to repay the outstanding Citizens Term Loan under the credit agreement dated March 31, 2021 the "Citizens Credit Agreement"), by and among the Borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Borrower as guarantors, the lenders thereto, and Citizens Bank, N.A. ("Citizens Bank"). 

There is no principal amortization prior to maturity under the SLR Credit Agreement except for certain mandatory prepayments to be made with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events, and other extraordinary receipts and upon the occurrence of certain other events, in each case subject to certain reinvestment rights, thresholds and other exceptions. Unfunded commitments will be subject to an unused facility fee, which will be payable monthly in arrears, as of the month following the closing, at a rate of per annum. All amounts owed under the SLR Credit Facility are due and payable on the five -year anniversary of the closing date (the "Maturity Date"), or earlier following a change in control or an event of default, unless otherwise extended in accordance with the terms of the SLR Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the SLR Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to a 3 -month term SOFR plus , subject to a floor, plus a margin (the "Applicable Margin") of which was increased to pursuant to the Second Amendment to the SLR Credit Agreement (the "Second Amend ment"). The Applicable Margin will be reduced to when the Borrower's fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than to 1. The opening interest rate of the SLR Credit Facility was (SOFR + CSA + ), which increased to (SOFR + CSA+ as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The SLR Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants which impose limitations on the way the Credit Parties conducts business, including limitations on the amount of additional debt the Credit Parties are able to incur and their ability to make certain investments or other restricted payments. The SLR Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and those of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including the Borrower. 
 
 The Borrower's ability to draw on the SLR Revolver depends on its weekly borrowing base, which is calculated by applying specified percentages established by SLR to the Borrower's eligible accounts receivable and cash, less reserves, subject to certain limitations. 
 
 Debt issuance costs and debt discount costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to the issuance and amendments of the SLR Revolver was and , respectively, as of September 30, 2024 . The amounts are included in other non-current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes these costs over the life of the related debt. 
 
 On May 15, 2024, the Credit Parties and SLR entered into the First Amendment to the SLR Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"), pursuant to which SLR, among other things, 1 waived any required prepayments on the SLR Revolver from the proceeds from the Company's Private Placement, 2 required that the Credit Parties (as defined in the SLR Credit Agreement) retain a financial advisor to assist in preparing the Company's projections, 3 increased the minimum excess availability covenant following the Private Placement (as defined herein) (see Note 8 , Equity) 4 amended the definition of borrowing base (as defined in the SLR Credit Agreement), and 5 amended certain post-closing obligations. 
 
 On August 19, 2024, the Credit Parties and SLR entered into the Second Amendment, which, among other things, required that the Company raise 2,000 in additional capital. To raise the capital, the Company entered into convertible subordinated notes, as described below, raising an aggregate . In addition, SLR waived non-compliance with the financial covenants as of June 30, 2024, modified the financial covenants through December 31, 2025, ended a requirement to engage a financial advisor, increased the Applicable Margin from to , and waived any required prepayments from the proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes financing. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Credit Parties were not in compliance with their financial covenants under the SLR Credit Agreement, which the Borrower had to report by October 31, 2024 , and which would have resulted in an event of default; however, on October 30, 2024 , the Credit Parties and SLR entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which SLR extended the deadline for delivery of the compliance certificate required for the fiscal month ended September 30, 2024 , and the related notice of event of default, to November 19, 2024. 
 
 On November 15, 2024 , the Credit Parties and SLR entered into the Third Amendment to the SLR Credit Agreement, which, among other things, required that the Company raise at least 7,500 of additional capital by November 29, 2024 . In addition, the Third Amendment waived non-compliance with the financial covenants as of September 30, 2024 , extended the duration of the call protection applicable to the loans, and modified the cash dominion provisions to remain in effect on an indefinite basis. 

Based on current projections, the Company expects to be in compliance with the new financial covenants during the next twelve months. However, the Company has not met its projections for certain recent quarters, so there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its projections in the future. I f during any fiscal quarter, the Credit Parties do not comply with any of their financial covenants, such non-compliance would result in an event of default that would give SLR the right to accelerate maturities. Additionally, if the Company fails to raise capital in at least the amount required under the Third Amendment by November 29, 2024, such failure would also result in an event of default that would give SLR the right to accelerate maturities. Accordingly, all borrowings under the Credit Agreement have been classified as current as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Note Payable 
 
 On March 17, 2024, Fluent, LLC entered into a junior secured promissory note (the "Note Payable") with Freedom Debt Relief, LLC ("FDR") in the principal amount of in connection with the Berman Settlement Agreement (see Note 11 , Contingencies ). The Note Payable bears interest equal to one -month CME Term SOFR (defined as the rate published by the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited) plus per annum, compounded quarterly. The opening interest rate of the Note Payable was (SOFR + ), which decreased to (SOFR + 11 as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 A maximum of of the borrowings under the Note Payable are secured by substantially all of the assets of Fluent, LLC. This security interest is subordinate to the security interest under the SLR Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Note Payable matures on March 31, 2026 and interest is payable quarterly. Scheduled principal amortization of the Note Payable is per quarter, which commenced with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, but was subsequently paid upon receipt of the invoice from FDR and applied as of July 17, 2024. 
 
 Convertible Notes, with related parties 
 
 On August 19, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Securities Purchase Agreement") with certain of the Company's officers and directors and the largest stockholder (the "Purchasers") to sell convertible subordinated promissory notes (the "Convertible Notes") in aggregate principal amount of . The Convertible Notes mature on April 2, 2029, and bear interest at per annum payable quarterly in kind or may be paid in cash (subject to payment conditions in the Subordination Agreement (as defined below)) beginning December 31, 2024. Subject to certain payment conditions in the Subordination Agreement, the Company may prepay the Convertible Notes in whole or in part at any time upon ten days written notice, provided that no prepayment will be permitted prior to stockholder approval without the consent of the applicable holder. 
 
 Each holder of the Convertible Notes is entitled to convert the Conversion Amount (as defined below) into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) and (ii) the greater of (A) the consolidated closing bid price of the Company's Common Stock as reported on Nasdaq on the applicable conversion date and (B) , in each case subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalizations and the like. However, the applicable conversion price will in no event be lower than the price established by clause (ii) above unless and until the Company's stockholders have approved matters related to the issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. The "Conversion Amount" is the sum of all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note, as designated by the holder upon exercise of its right of conversion, plus all accrued and unpaid interest. The Convertible Notes are subject to additional limits on conversion until stockholder approval is obtained, including an aggregate limit on the number of shares that may be issued upon conversion to of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock and provisions to prevent a change of control as defined in the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to secure stockholder approval at such meeting, including providing a recommendation for approval by the Company s board of directors. Holders of the Convertible Notes will be permitted to vote on such stockholder approval, but may not vote any shares obtained from conversion of the Convertible Notes prior to such vote. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the Convertible Notes. 
 
 In connection with the Second Amendment and the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company and SLR entered into a Second Amendment Subordination Agreement with each purchaser of the Convertible Notes on August 19, 2024 the "Subordination Agreements"). The Subordination Agreements confirm the subordinated nature of the Convertible Notes and restrict payments to and remedies of the holders of the Convertible Notes for so long as the SLR Credit Agreement has indebtedness outstanding. The Subordination Agreements provide that the Company may not make any payment of principal or interest on the Convertible Notes unless certain conditions are met. 

The Convertible Notes are accounted for at fair value due to the election of the fair value option ("FVO") in accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825" ). Within ASC 825, the FVO can be elected for debt host financial instruments containing embedded features which would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from the debt-host and recognized as separate derivative liabilities subject to initial and subsequent periodic estimated fair value measurements under ASC 815. Notwithstanding, ASC 825 - 10 - 15 - 4 provides for the FVO election, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by ASC 825 - 10 - 15 - 5, to be afforded to financial instruments, wherein bifurcation of an embedded derivative is not necessary, and the financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and then subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. 
 
 Within ASC 825 - 10 - 45 - 5, the estimated fair value adjustments are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income with respect to the portion of the fair value adjustment attributed to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, with the remaining amount of the fair value adjustment recognized as other income (expense) within the consolidated statement of operations. As then provided by ASC 825 - 10 - 50 - 30 (b), the estimated fair value adjustment is presented in a respective single line item within other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations, as the Company concluded that the change in fair value of the Convertible Notes was not attributable to instrument specific credit risk. The Company then elected to not present the interest expense for the Convertible Notes separately. 
 
 The initial fair value was determined to be greater than the principal balance of the Convertible Notes. The Company noted that the transaction was entered into with certain of the Company's officers and directors and the largest stockholder and was required under the Second Amendment for liquidity needs. Further, the Company reviewed the valuation and determined it was appropriate. As a result, based on ASC 825 - 10, the Company recorded a day one unrealized loss on the Convertible Notes of . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the principal balance of the Convertible Notes was , with a fair value of . The Company recognized an additional increase in fair value of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , which was recognized as after current period other income (loss) from operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , accrued interest was paid in kind.

Convertible Notes, with related parties 
 
 The Company issued the Convertible Notes on August 19, 2024 and elected the fair value option, see Note 5 , Long-term debt, net . The following is a reconciliation of the fair value from the issuance date of such notes to September 30, 2024 : 

Loss on change in fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations 
 Fair value as of September 30, 2024 

As the Convertible Notes mature on April 2, 2029, and bear interest at per annum paid in kind but may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock the "call option"), the estimated fair value is computed as the sum of (a) the present value of the expected interest and principal payments using the discounted cash flow method based on an estimated discount rate and (b) the fair value of the call option computer using the Black-Scholes model. Both approaches are based on the following assumptions: 

Strike price 
 Value of common stock 
 Expected term (years) 
 Volatility 
 Risk free rate 
 Discount rate 

Contingent Consideration 
 
 In connection with the contingent consideration received related to the consolidation of TAPP, the Company had to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company determined that the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, excluding the net working capital, was a Level 3 measurement, as certain inputs to determine fair value were unobservable. See Note 12 , Variable Interest Entity . 

Payment for annual bonus 
 Adjustment to compensation expense 
 Fair value as of September 30, 2024 

The fair value of certain long-lived non-financial assets and liabilities may be required to be measured on a nonrecurring basis in certain circumstances, including when there is evidence of impairment. As of September 30, 2024 , certain non-financial assets have been measured at fair value subsequent to their initial recognition. The Company determined the estimated fair value to be a Level 3 measurement, as certain inputs used to determine fair value are unobservable. See Note 4 , Goodwill. 

differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily due to state and local tax expense and losses for which no tax benefit is recognized as such amounts are fully offset with a valuation allowance. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company's effective income tax rate of primarily represents the projected federal and state cash tax expense expected to result in taxable income for full-year 2023 after the impact of a non-deductible goodwill impairment against pre-tax year-to-date losses, offset by the benefit of federal research and development credits on expected federal cash tax expense. 

The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon its evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available as of the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than- not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than- not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Company's financial statements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was . If the Company's tax positions are ultimately sustained, the Company's liability would be reduced by 1,480, all of which would impact the Company's tax provision. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has not accrued any interest or penalties with respect to its uncertain tax positions. 
 
 The Company is reasonably certain that all of its uncertain tax positions will reverse within the next twelve months due to the closing of the statute of limitations. 

(the "Reverse Stock Split Ratio") reverse split of the issued shares of the Company's common stock (the "Reverse Stock Split") pursuant to a certificate of amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on April 11, 2024. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every six shares of common stock issued and outstanding or held by the Company in treasury stock were combined and reclassified into one share of common stock. fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who were otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share received an additional fraction of a share of common stock to round up to the next whole share. The Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder's percentage ownership interest or any stockholder's proportionate voting power, except for immaterial adjustments that resulted from the treatment of fractional shares. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the number of authorized shares of common stock or the par value per share of the common stock. 
 
 The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock from shares to shares and reduced the issued shares of common stock held by the Company in treasury stock from shares to shares. 
 
 The common stock began trading on a reverse split-adjusted basis at the opening of trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on April 12, 2024, under the same symbol (FLNT) with a new CUSIP number 34380C 201 ). 
 
 As of the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of shares available for issuance under the Company's equity incentive plans and the number of shares issuable pursuant to each outstanding equity award immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were reduced proportionately at the Reverse Stock Split Ratio, and the exercise price for each outstanding stock option was increased in inverse proportion to the Reverse Stock Split Ratio. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the number of issued shares of common stock was and , respectively, which included shares of treasury stock of and , respectively. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the increase in the number of issued shares of common stock was the result of the exercise of shares related to the warrants, as described below, and shares of common stock issued upon vesting of RSUs, in which shares of common stock were withheld to cover statutory taxes upon such vesting.

The forfeited shares of common stock may be taken into treasury stock by the Company or sold on the open market. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , shares of common stock were withheld to cover statutory taxes owed by certain employees for this purpose. See Note 9 , Share-based compensation .

In connection with the Private Placement, the Company entered into Support Agreements with three of the Purchasers, the Company's largest stockholders, who agreed to vote all of their beneficially owned shares of the Company's common stock in favor of the corporate actions required for stockholder approval. Stockholder approval of the Private Placement was obtained on July 2, 2024, at a special meeting of the Company's stockholders. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , all of the Pre-Funded Warrants had been exercised. The issuance of the shares upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants was made in reliance upon the exemption from registration under Section 4 (a)( 2 of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended. 
 
 The settlement of the Pre-Funded Warrants was reflected in the Company's stockholder's equity within common stock and additional paid-in-capital as of September 30, 2024 . In accordance with ASC 815 - 40, Derivatives and Hedging, a contract is classified as an equity agreement if it is both indexed to its own stock and classified in stockholder's equity in its financial position. The Pre-Funded Warrants met the requirements of being classified as equity because (i) they had a fixed share limit and the Company had sufficient authorized and unissued shares, (ii) they required physical or net share settlement, and (iii) no cash payments or settlement top-off was required by the Company.

Any shares that remain unvested as of the fifth anniversary of the grant date will vest in full on such date. The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated at the trading day before the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The key assumptions utilized to calculate the grant-date fair values for these awards are summarized below:

The deemed fair value of the consideration received was , which consisted of (i) the forgiveness of a deferred payment owed by the Company in connection with the True North Acquisition on January 1, 2022, ii) a share of the True North contribution margin after the closing until the Company has received an amount equal to the closing net working capital of approximately , and (iii) a continued share of the True North contribution margin of an additional amount at fair value of . The True North founder who entered into an employment agreement in connection with the True North Acquisition has remained an employee of the Company after the closing of the True North Conveyance. It was determined that True North did not meet the discontinued operations criterion under ASC 205 - 20, Discontinued Operations . 
 
 In accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation ("ASC 810" ), the Company determined that True North was a VIE based upon the receivable for the consideration to be received. Initially, as the majority membership owner of Caspian remained a full-time employee of the Company and had the power to unilaterally make significant decisions at True North, it was determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of Caspian and therefore should consolidate Caspian's operations going forward, under the de facto agent guidance. As a result, no gain or loss was to be recognized on the True North Conveyance. On September 1, 2024, Caspian s operating agreement was amended to require the consent of multiple members rather than a majority interest for major decisions. As a result, the Company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary, and under ASC 810, True North was no longer consolidated as of September 1, 2024. No gain or loss was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . The Company will have no continued business relationship with True North apart from receiving the remaining consideration owed by True North. 
 
 The Company s total exposure to True North consists solely of the carrying amount of the receivable related to the True North Conveyance which is recorded as other non-current assets totaling as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 TAPP 

On
 January 9, 2023, the Company entered into employment agreements with certain key employees of TAPP, an influencer-based business that uses an application to utilize its relationships with influencers to bring consumers to advertising clients. The Company is also a customer of TAPP and accounts for the majority of TAPP's revenues. As a result of significant influence over TAPP's key employees and financial performance, the Company determined that TAPP qualified as a VIE in which the Company has a variable interest and that the Company is the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the Company consolidates the TAPP operations. As the Company does
 not have an equity interest in TAPP,
 of the net assets and results of the operations of TAPP are attributable to non-controlling interests.

As the Company gained control of TAPP, in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, it was then determined that TAPP constituted a business. The deemed fair value of the consideration was , which consisted of of initial cash and contingent upon the achievement of specified revenue and media margin targets over three years. The fair value of assets acquired, which excluded the immaterial net-working capital, were determined to be the publisher contracts of , which were valued using the 'with or without' method, a variation of the income approach, to be amortized over a period of one year and industry-based trade secrets of , which were valued using the excess earnings method, a variation of the income approach, to be amortized over a period of four years. The amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the amount of and primarily represents workforce and expected cash flow generation for the TAPP business that does not qualify for separate recognition as intangible assets included within the Fluent operating segment. For tax purposes, the value of the acquisition payments is treated as ordinary compensation for services rendered, deductible when paid and included in the employees' wages.

Overview 
 
 Fluent, Inc. ("we," "us," "our," "Fluent," or the "Company") is an industry leader in digital marketing services. We primarily perform customer acquisition services by operating highly scalable digital marketing campaigns, through which we connect our advertiser clients with consumers they are seeking to reach. We access these consumers through both our owned and operated digital media properties and Commerce Media Solutions marketplace. Since the beginning of 2023, we delivered data and performance-based customer acquisition services for over 500 consumer brands, direct marketers, and agencies across a wide range of industries, including Media Entertainment, Financial Products Services, Health Life Sciences, Retail Consumer, and Staffing Recruitment. 
 
 We attract consumers at scale to our owned and operated digital media properties primarily through promotional offerings where they are rewarded for completing activities within the platforms. When registering on our sites, consumers provide their name, contact information, and opt-in permission to present them with relevant offers on behalf of our clients. Approximately 90 of these users engage with our media on their mobile devices or tablets. 
 
 Once users have registered on our sites, we integrate our proprietary direct marketing technologies and analytics to engage them with surveys, polls, and other experiences, through which we learn about their lifestyles, preferences, and purchasing histories, among other matters. Based on these insights, we serve targeted, relevant offers to them on behalf of our clients. As new users register and engage with our sites and existing registrants re-engage, the enrichment of our database expands our addressable client base and improves the effectiveness of our performance-based campaigns. 
 
 We also operate our Commerce Media Solutions platform on partner sites where we embed our proprietary ad-serving technology to identify and acquire additional consumers for our advertiser clients. Our technology is integrated at key moments in the consumer experience to capitalize on high engagement and improve conversion. For example, our Adflow product connects our advertisers to consumers on e-commerce websites after check-out. These syndicated Commerce Media Solutions generate meaningful income for our media partners, while driving high-quality customer acquisition for our advertiser clients. In contrast to the media agreements we enter into to attract users to our owned and operated websites, which can be paused or cancelled on short notice, we sign agreements with media partners for our Commerce Media Solutions platform with terms of at least one year and up to five years. We typically remunerate our media partners on a revenue share and/or impression basis. 
 
 Additionally, we operate a call center-supported performance marketplace that provides live call-based performance campaigns to help clients increase engagement and in some cases sell products and services directly on behalf of our clients. The call solutions marketplace serves clients across an array of industries but has had a heavy focus on the health insurance sector.

Table of Contents 

Since our inception, we have amassed a large, proprietary database of first-party, self-declared user information and preferences. We solicit our users' consent to be contacted by us and/or our advertisers via various contact methods including email, telephone, SMS/text, and push messaging. We then leverage their self-declared data in our array of performance offerings primarily in two ways: (1) to serve advertisements that we believe will be relevant to users based on the information they provide when they engage on our sites or other partner sites through our syndicated performance marketplaces and (2) to provide our clients with users' contact information so that such clients may communicate with them directly. We may also leverage our existing technology and database to drive new revenue streams, including utilization-based models e.g. , programmatic advertising). 
 
 We generate revenue by delivering measurable marketing results to our clients. We differentiate ourselves from other marketing alternatives by our abilities to provide clients with a cost-effective and measurable return on advertising spend ("ROAS"), a measure of profitability of sales compared to the money spent on ads, and to manage highly targeted and highly fragmented online media sources. We are predominantly paid on a negotiated or market-driven "per click," "per lead," or other "per action" basis that aligns with the customer acquisition cost targets of our clients. We bear the costs of acquiring traffic from publishers' performance marketplaces that ultimately generate qualified clicks, leads, calls, app downloads, or customers for our clients. 
 
 Through AdParlor, LLC ("AdParlor"), we conduct our non-core business which offers clients various social media strategies through the planning and buying of media on different platforms.

 Trends Affecting our Business 
 
 Development, Acquisition and Retention of High-Quality Targeted Media Traffic 
 
 Our business depends on identifying and accessing high quality media sources and on our ability to attract targeted users to our owned and operated media properties. As our business has grown, we have attracted larger and more sophisticated clients to our marketplaces. To further increase our value proposition to clients and to fortify our leadership position in the evolving regulatory landscape of our industry, we implemented a Traffic Quality Initiative in 2020 and established new syndicated performance marketplaces in 2023 to access more higher value consumers. Sourcing high quality traffic will remain a focus and part of a broader initiative to improve customer acquisition for our clients. 

29

Table of Contents 

Starting in 2022, we increased our spend with major digital media platforms, revised our bidding strategies for affiliate traffic, and developed partnerships to expand traffic from social media platforms, including the growing influencer sector. We have pursued strategic initiatives that enable us to grow revenue with existing user traffic volume by attracting users to our owned media properties via email and SMS messages. In addition, we have focused on improved monetization of consumer traffic through improved customer relationship management and internal capabilities that allow us to re-engage consumers who have registered on our owned media properties. Through these initiatives, our business has become less dependent on the volume of users to generate revenue growth. 
 
 We believe that significant value has been, and will continue to be, created by improving the quality of traffic and value of consumers sourced to our media properties and commerce media marketplace. Increased user participation rates lead to higher conversion rates, resulting in increased monetization, and ultimately increased revenue and media margin. Media margin, a non-GAAP measure, is the portion of gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) reflecting variable costs paid for media and related expenses and excluding non-media cost of revenue. 
 
 Since 2022, however, we have experienced challenges growing traffic volume to our owned and operated properties, primarily due to the FTC inquiry and subsequent FTC Consent Order that tightened our standards for media sourcing and put us at a competitive disadvantage versus the market. Other factors that affected our traffic volume have included the volatility of affiliate supply sources, changes in search engine algorithms, and email and text message blocking algorithms. In response to these challenges, we have invested in strategic and internal efforts to secure additional traffic from the growing influencer sector and to expand our ad network beyond our owned and operated marketplaces to new syndicated commerce media marketplaces. The mix and profitability of our media channels, strategies, and partners is likely to continue to be dynamic and reflect evolving market trends and the regulatory environment. 
 
 Advertiser Trends Seasonality 
 
 We deliver data and performance-based marketing executions to our clients across a wide range of industries, including Media Entertainment, Financial Products Services, Health Life Sciences, Retail Consumer, and Staffing Recruitment. In 2023, we experienced slowdowns in certain sectors of the Media Entertainment, Staffing Recruitment, and Financial Products Services industries. Both data and performance-based spend has continued to be challenged in 2024 by general economic uncertainty. In the first nine months of 2024 revenue declined due to media supply challenges in our owned and operated marketplaces and regulatory pressure on the insurance sector in our call solutions marketplace. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect that growth of our Commerce Media Solutions business will partially or completely offset the year over year revenue decline related to media supply challenges in our owned and operated marketplaces and within our AdParlor unit. 
 
 To offset individual advertiser pull-back, we continue to work with select advertisers to define high performing consumer segments and strategically price paid conversions to help clients drive higher ROAS. This initiative has driven increased budgets from clients across the Media Entertainment industry, which represents a large component of our revenue mix. 
 
 Additionally, our performance is subject to fluctuations as a result of seasonality and cyclicality in our clients' businesses and fluctuations in media sources. Specifically, our retail specific media partners in our commerce media marketplace and our call solutions business that benefits from Medicare open enrollment period experience increased volume in the fourth quarters. Other factors affecting our business may include macroeconomic conditions that impact the digital advertising industry, the various client verticals we serve, and general market conditions. 
 
 We believe the fourth quarter of 2024 will continue to be characterized by tepid economic conditions and potential media supply uncertainty in the owned and operated marketplaces. To confront these headwinds, we are continuing to invest into securing additional media partners for our commerce media marketplace and diversify our client base. We also continue to develop our "ROAS program" across additional segments of advertisers in an effort to gain additional budget allocations and further improve our user monetization. 
 
 Business Practices Compliance 
 
 We have continued to be affected by slowed economic conditions and the impacts of the FTC Consent Order (the "FTC Consent Order") (as described in Note 11, Contingencies , in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements) on our owned and operated marketplaces and programmatic advertising business. The industry-leading compliance measures we implemented on our owned and operated marketplaces continue to negatively impact our revenues and media margin. Although we have not yet experienced it, we continue to believe that the increased regulatory scrutiny on the broader industry will eventually eliminate the advantage that less compliance-focused competitors currently benefit from, enabling us to recapture market share.

Current Economic Conditions 
 
 We are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by events with significant macroeconomic impacts. Inflation, rising interest rates, and reduced consumer confidence have caused our clients and their customers to be cautious in their spending. The full impact of these macroeconomic events and the extent to which these macro factors may impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future remains uncertain. In light of the challenging macro-economic environment, we continue to prioritize strategic investments that have near-term benefits to revenue while also streamlining our organization through targeted workforce reductions. 
 
 Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K "Economic or political instability could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations," and "We are exposed to credit risks from our clients, and we may not be able to collect on amounts owed to us", for further discussion of the possible impact of unfavorable conditions on our business. 
 
 Definitions, Reconciliations and Uses of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We report the following non-GAAP measures: 
 
 Media margin is defined as that portion of gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) reflecting variable costs paid for media and related expenses and excluding non-media cost of revenue. Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) represents revenue minus cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Media margin is also presented as a percentage of revenue. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding (1) income taxes, (2) interest expense, net, (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) share-based compensation expense, (5) loss on early extinguishment of debt, (6) accrued compensation expense for Put/Call Consideration, (7) goodwill impairment, (8) impairment of intangible assets, (9) loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment, (10) fair value adjustment of Convertible Notes, (11) acquisition-related costs, (12) restructuring and other severance costs, and (13) certain litigation and other related costs. 
 
 Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss), excluding (1) share-based compensation expense, (2) loss on early extinguishment of debt, (3) accrued compensation expense for Put/Call Consideration, (4) goodwill impairment, (5) impairment of intangible assets, (6) loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment, (7) fair value adjustment of Convertible Notes, (8) acquisition-related costs, (9) restructuring and other severance costs, and (10) certain litigation and other related costs. Adjusted net income (loss) is also presented on a per share (basic and diluted) basis. 
 
 Below is a reconciliation of media margin from gross profit (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure:

Table of Contents 

We present media margin, media margin as a percentage of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per share as supplemental measures of our financial and operating performance because we believe they provide useful information to investors. More specifically: 
 
 Media margin, as defined above, is a measure of the efficiency of the Company's operating model. We use media margin and the related measure of media margin as a percentage of revenue as primary metrics to measure the financial return on our media and related costs, specifically to measure the degree by which the revenue generated from our digital marketing services exceeds the cost to attract the consumers to whom offers are made through our services. Media margin is used extensively by our management to manage our operating performance, including evaluating operational performance against budgeted media margin and understanding the efficiency of our media and related expenditures. We also use media margin for performance evaluations and compensation decisions regarding certain personnel. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, is another primary metric by which we evaluate the operating performance of our business, on which certain operating expenditures and internal budgets are based and by which, in addition to media margin and other factors, our senior management is compensated. The first three adjustments represent the conventional definition of EBITDA, and the remaining adjustments are items recognized and recorded under U.S. GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. These adjustments include certain litigation and other related costs associated with legal matters outside the ordinary course of business, including costs and accruals related to matters as described below (see Note 11, Contingencies , in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements). We consider items one-time in nature if they are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with SEC rules. There were no adjustments for one-time items in the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Adjusted net income (loss), as defined above, and the related measure of adjusted net income (loss) per share exclude certain items that are recognized and recorded under U.S. GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. We believe adjusted net income (loss) affords investors a different view of the overall financial performance of the Company than adjusted EBITDA and the U.S. GAAP measure of net income (loss). 
 
 Media margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures with certain limitations regarding their usefulness. They do not reflect our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, these metrics are not indicative of our overall results or indicators of past or future financial performance. Further, they are not financial measures of profitability and are neither intended to be used as a proxy for the profitability of our business nor to imply profitability. The way we measure media margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income (loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue was comprised of owned and operated marketplaces 43.5 million and 53.1 million, Commerce Media Solutions 10.4 million and 2.3 million, and other streams 10.6 million and 10.8 million, respectively. The decrease in owned and operated revenue was primarily attributable to a challenging macro-economic environment and a decrease in media supply resulting from changes in our business practices to comply with the FTC Consent Order, which in effect drove a reduction in spend from key clients in the Media Entertainment and Staffing Recruitment sectors. It was further negatively impacted by the enormous social media advertising spend driven by the US Presidential election, which started in late August and impacted our ability to buy media at acceptable margins for our demand. Partially offsetting that decline, our Commerce Media Solutions business added long-term contracts with new media partners which drove revenue up in the Retail Consumer sector. Within our other streams, our call solutions business also grew based on increased demand from the healthcare sector, offset by a decrease related to the True North business we exited in the second quarter of 2024. Although we have seen stabilization in owned and operated media supply, we expect year-over-year declines in that marketplace to continue; however, we expect such declines to be offset by the continued growth of Commerce Media Solutions. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue was comprised of owned and operated marketplaces 130.2 million and 185.8 million, Commerce Media Solutions 24.0 million and 3.5 million, and other streams 35.0 million and 36.3 million, respectively. The decrease in owned and operated revenue and increase in Commerce Media Solutions were mainly attributable to the items noted above. The decrease in other streams was related an increase in AdParlor offset by the decrease related to the True North business we exited in the second quarter of 2024.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consisted mainly of owned and operated media and fulfillment costs of 34.0 million and 40.3 million, Commerce Media Solutions media cost of 6.9 million and 2.1 million, media and enablement costs related to our other revenue streams of 6.9 million and 6.8 million, and indirect costs of revenue of 1.1 and 0.9 million, respectively. Our owned and operated cost of revenue primarily consists of media and related costs associated with acquiring traffic from third-party publishers, digital media platforms, and influencers for our owned and operated websites and fulfillment costs related to rewards earned by consumers. The decrease in owned and operated media cost was largely attributable to the challenges in acquiring media due to changes in our business practices to comply with the FTC Consent Order. Our Commerce Media Solutions cost of revenue consists of fees and revenue share payments made to media partners for revenue generated on their properties. The increase in cost of revenue in the Commerce Media Solutions was driven by increased media from new media partners added over the period. The increase in cost of revenue for other revenue streams, which includes, in addition to media costs, enablement costs and tracking costs related to our consumer data associated with our call centers, was attributable to these added costs needed to support the increased demand from the healthcare sector offset by a decrease related to our exit from the True North business in the second quarter of 2024. Indirect costs of revenue increased as a result of escalated hosting costs. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 the total cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 76 compared to 76 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consisted mainly of owned and operated media and fulfillment costs of 100.6 million, and 137.1 million, Commerce Media Solutions media cost of 16.5 million and 4.0 million, media and enablement costs related to other revenue streams of 22.0 million and 24.0 million, and indirect costs of 3.2 million and 2.9 million, respectively. The decrease in owned and operated costs and increase in Commerce Media Solutions costs were attributable to the items noted above. The decrease in all other streams was related to the True North business we exited in the second quarter of 2024, partly offset by an increase associated with our call centers, as noted above. The increase in indirect costs was also due to the reason noted above. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenue increased minimally to 75 compared to 74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

In the normal course of executing paid media campaigns to source consumer traffic, we regularly evaluate new channels, strategies, and partners. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, owned and operated digital media spend continued to be a mix of affiliate traffic, paid media from major digital platforms, influencer activations, and inventory from strategic media partners. Traffic acquisition costs incurred with the major digital media platforms have historically been higher than affiliate traffic sources and the mix and profitability of our media channels, strategies, and partners reflect evolving market dynamics, the impact of our Traffic Quality Initiative, and the increased compliance obligations from the FTC Consent Order. As we evaluate and scale new media channels, strategies, and partners, we may determine that certain sources initially able to provide us profitable quality traffic may not be able to maintain our quality standards over time, and we may need to discontinue, or direct a modification of the practices of such sources which could reduce profitability. We believe improved traffic quality is the foundation to support sustainable long-term growth and position us as an industry leader. Past levels of cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are not indicative of future costs, which may increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue as these uncertainties in our business play out.

The relatively consistent sales and marketing was primarily due to the decline of third-party referral fees and lower non-cash share-based compensation due to lower grants and performance, mainly offset by the increase in restructuring costs due to the current year period reductions in workforce, as described below, and higher professional fees related to consulting.

The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the absence of the credit for certain litigation and related costs due to insurance reimbursements for previously incurred legal fees and lower than expected regulatory settlement and an increase in restructuring or severance costs. This was partially offset by a reduction in salaries and benefits due to lower headcount, a decrease in professional fees, and a decline in share-based compensation expense. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023

The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the absence of the credit for certain litigation and related costs, which was partially offset by a reduction in salaries and benefits due to lower headcount, a decline in share-based compensation expense, and a decrease in acquisition related costs mainly due to the conveyance of True North, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023 and the first, second, and third quarters of 2024, the Company implemented reductions in the workforce that resulted in the termination of 20, 20, 19, and 29 employees, respectively, following management's determination to more effectively align resources with the Company's strategic initiatives. In connection with the first quarter 2023 reductions, the Company incurred 0.5 million in exit-related restructuring costs, consisting primarily of one-time termination benefits and associated costs, fully settled in cash by March 31, 2024. In connection with the first quarter 2024 reductions, the Company incurred 0.7 million in exit-related restructuring costs, consisting primarily of one-time termination benefits and associated costs, fully settled in cash by September 30, 2024. In connection with the second quarter 2024 reductions, the Company incurred 0.6 million in exit-related restructuring costs, consisting primarily of one-time termination benefits and associated costs, to be fully settled in cash by December 31, 2024. In connection with the third quarter 2024 reductions, the Company incurred 0.5 million in exit-related restructuring costs, consisting primarily of one-time termination benefits and associated costs, to be fully settled in cash by March 31, 2025. Apart from these exit-related restructuring costs, these reductions in workforce are expected to result in corresponding reductions in future salary and benefits within sales and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses.

 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded full valuation allowances against its net deferred tax assets. The Company intends to maintain full valuation allowances against the net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the release of all or some portion of such allowances. Release of some or all of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and an increase in deferred tax benefit for any period in which such a release may be recorded; however, the exact timing and amount of any valuation allowance release are subject to change, depending upon the level of profitability that the Company is able to achieve and the net deferred tax assets available.

 For the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023, 
 net loss was 
 7.9 million and 
 33.6 million, respectively, as a result of the foregoing. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net loss was 25.8 million and 61.3 million, respectively, as a result of the foregoing. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash (used in) provided by operating activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 12.0 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss in the current year period of 25.8 million represents a decrease of 35.5 million, as compared with net loss of 61.3 million in the prior period. Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities of 16.4 million in the current year period decreased by 50.4 million, as compared with 66.8 million in the prior period, primarily due to a goodwill impairment of 1.3 million and intangible impairment of 1.0 million in the current year period as compared to the goodwill impairment of 55.4 million in the prior period, partly offset by the current year period loss on the fair value adjustment of Convertible Notes of 2.8, loss on early extinguishment of debt of 1.0 million, and an increase in amortization of debt. There were changes in assets and liabilities consuming cash of 2.5 million in the current year period, as compared with sourcing of cash of 4.3 million in the prior period, primarily due to ordinary-course changes in working capital, largely involving the timing of receipt of amounts owing from clients and disbursements of amounts payable to vendors. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 4.7 million and 5.4 million, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to the impact of the 2023 TAPP consolidation, compared to the increase in investment in capitalized software in the current year period. 
 
 Cash (used in) provided by financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 8.7 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the sale of warrants, the net proceeds received from the issuance of the new debt, and the Convertible Notes, which was partly offset by repayment of the prior debt and repayments on the new debt revolver as well as debt financing costs. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had noncancelable operating lease commitments of 2.3 million and long-term debt with a 34.2 million principal balance. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded our operations using available cash. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of 7.8 million, a decrease of 8.0 million from 15.8 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, w e were not in compliance with our financial covenants under our credit facility. On April 2, 2024, Fluent, LLC, as Borrower, entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the "SLR Credit Agreement") with the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Borrower as guarantors, Crystal Financial LLC D/B/A SLR Credit Solutions, as administrative agent, lead arranger and bookrunner ("SLR"), and the lenders from time to time party thereto. The SLR Credit Agreement provides for a 20.0 million term loan (the "SLR Term Loan") and a revolving credit facility of up to 30.0 million (the "SLR Revolver" and, together with the SLR Term Loan, the "SLR Credit Facility"). We used a portion of the net proceeds of the SLR Credit Facility to repay our then-outstanding obligations under the Citizens Credit Agreement dated March 31, 2021, prior to its maturity. As of September 30, 2024 , the SLR Credit Facility had an outstanding principal balance of 32.5 million (of which 12.5 million relates to the SLR Revolver) and matures on April 2, 2029 (the "Maturity Date"). 
 
 The SLR Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and those of certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Fluent, LLC. The SLR Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants which impose limitations on the way we conduct our business, including, but not limited to, limitations on the amount of additional debt we are able to incur and our ability to make certain investments or to pay dividends or other restricted payments. The SLR Credit Agreement also contains certain affirmative covenants and customary events of default provisions, including, subject to grace periods, among others, payment default, covenant default and judgment default.

On May 15, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the SLR Credit Agreement, pursuant to which SLR (1) waived any required prepayments on the SLR Revolver from the proceeds from the Private Placement; (2) required that the Credit Parties (as defined in the SLR Credit Agreement) retain a financial advisor to assist in preparing the Company's projections, (3) increased the minimum excess availability covenant following the Private Placement; (4) amended the definition of borrowing base (as defined in the SLR Credit Agreement); and (5) amended certain post-closing obligations. 
 
 We entered into two letter agreements with SLR, one on July 31, 2024, and another on August 14, 2024, pursuant to which SLR extended the deadline for delivery of the compliance certificate required for the fiscal month ended June 30, 2024 , and the related notice of event of default, to August 21, 2024. 
 
 On August 19, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to the SLR Credit Agreement, which, among other things, required that we raise 2.0 million in additional capital. To raise the capital, we entered into convertible subordinated notes (See Note 5 , Long-term debt, net in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements) raising an aggregate of 2.1 million. In addition, the Second Amendment (1) waived non-compliance with the financial covenants as of June 30, 2024, (2) modified the financial covenants through December 31, 2025, (3) ended a requirement to engage a financial advisor, (4) increased the interest rate margin from 5.25 to 5.75 , and (5) and waived any required prepayments from the proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes financing. 
 
 As a result of our economic downward trends as described above in "Advertiser Trends Seasonality", we updated our projections in the fourth quarter of 2024 to reflect the continued pressure on our operating results. On October 30, 2024, we entered into a letter agreement with SLR, pursuant to which SLR extended the deadline for delivery of the compliance certificate required for the fiscal month ended September 30, 2024 , and the related notice of event of default, to November 19, 2 024. On November 15, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to the SLR Credit agreement, which, among other things, required that we raise at least 7.5 million of additional capital by November 29, 2024. In addition, the Third Amendment waived non-compliance with the financial covenants as of September 30, 2024, extended the duration of the call protection applicable to the loans, and modified the cash dominion provisions to remain in effect on an indefinite basis. (See Note 5 , Long-term debt, net in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements). 
 
 We may voluntarily prepay the SLR Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time, subject to a premium payable on the aggregate principal amount of any such voluntary prepayments within the first three years following the closing date. There is no principal amortization prior to maturity under the SLR Credit Agreement, except for certain mandatory prepayments to be made with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events, and other extraordinary receipts and upon the occurrence of certain other events, in each case, subject to certain reinvestment rights, thresholds and other exceptions. Unfunded commitments under the SLR Revolver will be subject to an unused facility fee, which will be payable monthly in arrears, as of the month following the closing, at a rate of 0.50 per annum. All amounts owed under the SLR Credit Facility will be due and payable on the Maturity Date, or earlier following a change in control or other event of default, unless otherwise extended in accordance with the terms of the SLR Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the SLR Credit Agreement currently bear interest at a rate per annum equal to a 3-month term SOFR plus 0.26161 , subject to a 1.50 floor, plus 5.75 (the "Applicable Margin"). The Applicable Margin will be reduced to 5.0 when our fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than 1.10 to 1. The opening interest rate of the SLR Credit Facility was 10.81 (SOFR + CSA + 5.25 ), which increased to 11.03 (SOFR + CSA+5.75 as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Given the continued challenges we have faced achieving profitability, we made reductions in workforce throughout 2024 and continue to further consider cost reduction measures and focus resources on opportunities that will enable us to meet our projected budget and cash flow requirements. We had divested a non-core business unit (see Note 12 , Variable Interest Entity, in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements), transferred another business unit (see Note 3 , Intangible assets, net in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements), and are reviewing other business units to determine the impact of potential divestments. 
 
 We may explore the possible acquisition of businesses, products and/or technologies that are complementary to our existing business. We continue to identify and prioritize additional technologies, which we may wish to develop internally or through licensing or acquisition from third parties. While we may engage from time to time in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions, there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will be made or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our then current business or realize anticipated cost synergies. In order to finance such acquisitions and working capital, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Any equity or debt financings, if available at all, may be on terms which are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to shareholders.

Based on current projections, we expect to be in compliance with the new financial covenants for each of the quarters in the twelve months following the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, we have not met our projections for certain recent quarters, so there can be no assurance that we will meet our projections in the future. I f during any fiscal quarter, we do not comply with any of our financial covenants, such non-compliance would result in an event of default that would give SLR the right to accelerate maturities. Additionally, if we fail to raise capital in at least the amount required under the Third Amendment by November 29, 2024, such failure would also result in an event of default that would give SLR the right to accelerate maturities. In such case, we would not have sufficient funds to repay the SLR Term Loan and the SLR Revolver (as described above). In addition, even if we are able to raise capital as required by the Third Amendment, there is no assurance that such capital plus borrowing base on the SLR Revolver will be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months. If needed, we will consider implementing other cost saving measures, but there is no guarantee that such plans would be successfully executed or have the expected benefits. As a result, management concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, recoverability of the carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 As disclosed in Note 3, Intangible assets, net, we conducted an interim test of recoverability of its long-lived assets for the three months ended June 30, 2024. We compared the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If we were to experience sales declines, a significant change in operating margins which may impact our cash flows, and/or a decrease in our projected long-term growth rates, there would be an increased risk of impairment of other assets. Based on the results of this approach as of June 30, 2024, we concluded that the long-lived asset was not recoverable and an impairment loss was calculated. We assessed the fair value taking into account the market and the impact of the asset on the forecast and determined that the full remaining balance was impaired. As such, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 383 in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 As disclosed in Note 4, Goodwill, we conducted an interim test of the fair value of its goodwill for potential impairment for the three months ended June 30, 2024. We considered a combination of income and market approaches to determine the fair value of the All Other reporting unit and determined the income approach provided the best indication of fair value. The critical assumptions in the income approach include forecasted revenues and profitability, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. If we were to experience sales declines, a significant change in operating margins which may impact our cash flows, an increase in our discount rates, and/or a decrease in our projected long-term growth rates, there would be an increased risk of impairment of goodwill. Based on the results of this approach as of June 30, 2024, we concluded that its carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value by 58 . As such, we concluded that its goodwill of 1,261 for the All Other reporting unit was impaired and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of its remaining balance in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 As disclosed in Note 5, Long-term debt, net, we evaluated the terms of our convertible notes to determine whether the debt instrument contained an embedded derivative, and therefore a hybrid instrument, in which then the fair value option can be elected. The determination is based on judgment when considering the terms of the agreement. To then determine the fair value of the convertible notes, we considered the length of the term until conversion and then applied a discount rate based on that. We then applied the Black Scholes methodology to determine the conversion date stock price based on assumptions for volatility, risk free-rate, the current stock price, and term, noting that if any were to change driven by macro-economic factors as well as Company specific results, the impact to the fair value may be significant. As such, we concluded that its fair value was 4,860 as of the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Further details of the Company's accounting policies are available in Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies , to the consolidated financial statements.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Based on the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 and concluded they were effective as of that date. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 From time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results. 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K as updated and supplemented by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The risk factors below supplement or update the risk factors in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. 
 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
 
 We have experienced a continued decline in our operating results, driven primarily by the continued impact of the imposed regulatory requirements on our owned and operated digital media properties. 
 
 The SLR Credit Agreement requires us to maintain and comply with certain financial covenants. Moreover, the borrowings under the SLR Revolver under the SLR Credit Agreement are limited to a borrowing base that fluctuates as regularly as weekly based on our eligible accounts receivable. As a result of the continued decline in financial performance of our owned and operated digital media properties throughout the third quarter of 2024, our accounts receivable were insufficient to support the borrowing base needed to fund operations through the end of the third quarter of 2024. We therefore entered into convertible subordinated notes in August 2024, further updated our projections to reflect the continued decline in our operating results, and entered into the Second Amendment with SLR on August 19, 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were not in compliance with our financial covenants under the SLR Credit Agreement, which we had to report by October 31, 2024, and which would have resulted in an event of default. However, we entered into a letter agreements pursuant to which SLR extended the deadline for delivery of the compliance certificate required for the fiscal month ended September 30, 2024, and the related notice of event of default, to November 19, 2024. 
 
 On November 15, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to the SLR Credit Agreement, which, among other things, required us to raise at least 7.5 million of additional capital by November 29, 2024. In addition, the Third Amendment waived non-compliance with the financial covenants as of September 30, 2024, extended the duration of the call protection applicable to the loans, and modified the cash dominion provisions to remain in effect on an indefinite basis. We will seek to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked, or subordinated debt financings; however, whether and when we can effect such financings and how much capital we can raise depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, and our determination as to the appropriate sources of funding for our operations. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available by November 29, 2024.

Based on current projections, we expect to be in compliance with the new financial covenants for each of the quarters in the twelve months following the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, we have not met our projections for certain recent quarters, so there can be no assurance that we will meet our projections in the future. I f during any fiscal quarter, we do not comply with any of our financial covenants, such non-compliance would result in an event of default that would give SLR the right to accelerate maturities. Additionally, if we fail to raise capital in at least the amount required under the Third Amendment by November 29, 2024, such failure would also result in an event of default. In such case, we would not have sufficient funds to repay the SLR Term Loan and the SLR Revolver. In addition, even if we are able to raise additional capital as required by the Third Amendment, there is no assurance that such capital plus the available cash plus borrowing base on the SLR Revolver will be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months. If needed, we will consider implementing other cost-saving measures, but there is no guarantee that such plans would be successfully executed or have the expected benefits. As a result, management concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 If our current plans are not successful, we may need to consider other strategic alternatives, including restructuring or refinancing our debt, seeking additional equity or debt financing, reducing or delaying our business activities and strategic initiatives, selling assets, and other strategic transactions and/or other measures. We have relied upon financing provided by our officers, directors and largest stockholders, and such holders may be unwilling or unable to continue providing financing should additional financing be required. Other financing sources may be unwilling to provide such funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we seek additional financing to fund our operations and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we may find it especially difficult to raise funds on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Furthermore, the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause publishers, vendors, advertisers and other clients (current and potential) to review their business relationships and terms with us. Uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern could also have a material and adverse impact on the price of our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to obtain stock-based financing or enter into strategic transactions. 
 
 We require additional capital in the future to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, the future growth of our business and operations would be severely limited. 
 
 We intend to continue to make investments to support our growth and may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances. While the SLR Credit Agreement includes an undrawn revolving credit facility of up to 30 million that we can use subject to certain conditions, we require additional capital to satisfy the requirements of the Third Amendment to SLR Credit Agreement and we may require additional capital not available under the SLR Credit Agreement due to limitations in the borrowing base. 
 
 In addition to revenue from business operations and proceeds from the SLR Credit Agreement, the Company's primary source of working capital to date has been through the sale of equity and subordinated debt securities to officers, directors and a principal stockholder. We may seek to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked, or subordinated debt financings; however, when we can effect such financings and how much capital we can raise depends on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determination as to the appropriate sources of funding for our operations. The SLR Credit Agreement generally prohibits debt financings without SLR's consent and requires proceeds from equity financings to be used to prepay indebtedness to SLR. Accordingly, we will not be able to raise capital for uses other than prepayment of SLR indebtedness without SLR's consent. In addition, the SLR Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants, and any non-compliance with those covenants could result in an acceleration of the repayment of the amounts outstanding thereunder. Furthermore, equity or debt financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing stockholders, and debt financings may subject us to restrictive covenants, operational restrictions and security interests in our assets. 
 
 There can be no assurance that other capital will be available when needed or that, if available, it will be obtained on terms favorable to us and our stockholders. Disruptions in the global equity and credit markets may also limit our ability to access capital. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue certain operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 On August 19, 2024, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (the "Securities Purchase Agreements") with certain accredited and/or sophisticated investors (the "Purchasers") to sell convertible subordinated promissory notes (the "Convertible Notes") in aggregate principal amount of 2.1 million. The Convertible Promissory Notes mature on April 2, 2029, bear interest at 13 per annum payable quarterly in kind or may be paid in cash (subject to payment conditions in the Subordination Agreement described below). Subject to the payment conditions in the Subordination Agreement described below, the Company may prepay the Convertible Notes in whole or in part at any time upon ten days written notice; provided that, no prepayment will be permitted prior to the stockholder approval described below without the consent of the applicable holder. 
 
 Each holder of a Convertible Note is entitled to convert the Conversion Amount (as defined below) into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) 3.01, and (ii) the greater of (A) the consolidated closing bid price of the Company s common stock as reported on Nasdaq on the applicable conversion date and (B) 1.00, in each case subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalizations and the like. However, the applicable conversion price will in no event be lower than the price established by clause (ii) above unless and until the Company s stockholders have approved matters related to the issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, which vote is expected to take place at the Company s 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. The Conversion Amount is the sum of all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note, as designated by the holder upon exercise of its right of conversion, plus all accrued and unpaid interest. The Convertible Notes are subject to additional limits on conversion until stockholder approval is obtained, including an aggregate limit on the number of shares that may be issued upon conversion to 19.99 of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock and provisions to prevent a change of control as defined in the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Holders of the Convertible Notes will be permitted to vote on such stockholder approval, but may not vote any shares obtained from conversion of the Convertible Notes prior to such vote. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the Convertible Notes. 
 
 In connection with the Second Amendment and the Purchase Agreements, the Company, SLR and the purchasers of the Convertible Notes entered into a Second Amendment Subordination Agreement dated August 19, 2024 (the "Subordination Agreement"). The Subordination Agreement confirms the subordinated nature of the Convertible Notes and restricts payments to and remedies of the holders of the Convertible Notes for so long as the SLR Credit Agreement has indebtedness outstanding. The Subordination Agreement provides that the Company may not make any payment of principal or interest on the Convertible Notes unless the conditions set forth in either in clause (i) or clause (ii) below are satisfied: 
 
 (i) (a) no event of default under the SLR Credit Agreement exists before or immediately after giving effect to such payment, (b) the Borrower has demonstrated to the satisfaction of SLR compliance with certain financial covenants on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment, and (c) SLR s receipt of the Company s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. 
 
 (ii) (a) no event of default under the SLR Credit Agreement exists before or immediately after giving effect to such payment, (b) the Company has raised equity capital excluding the proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes prior to June 30, 2025 and the payments made in respect of the Convertible Notes do not exceed an amount that equals the positive difference of the amount of such equity raise and 7,000,000, and (c) the Borrower has demonstrated to the satisfaction of SLR compliance with certain financial covenants on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment.

All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. Eastern time shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. 

(b) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of Adjusted Term SOFR and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Loans made. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 

49

(i) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of Adjusted Term SOFR and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 

(c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Loans set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds promptly (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 

(d) Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of each of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and Revolving Credit Loans, and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c) . 

(e) Funding Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 

50

2.11 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:

(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 

2.12 Collateral and Guarantees . 

(a) Collateral . The Loans and the other Obligations shall be secured by valid, first priority (subject to Permitted Liens), perfected and enforceable Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Obligations, in all of the Collateral subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Security Documents.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A) , (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment, such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Credit Party is a U.S. Person, 

(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax (or any substantively comparable subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto);

(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 

57

(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(e)(ii)(E) , the Administrative Agent shall not be required to deliver any documentation pursuant to this Section 3.01(e)(ii)(E) that the Administrative Agent is not legally eligible to deliver as a result of a Change in Law after the Closing Date. 

(iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 

(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds . Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Credit Party or with respect to which any Credit Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01 , it shall pay to the Credit Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Credit Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Credit Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Credit Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Credit Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Credit Party or any other Person. 

58

(g) Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 

3.02 Inability to Determine Rates; Illegality 

(a) If the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) in connection with any request for a Loan that (a) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining Adjusted Term SOFR or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR (or such replacement convention) with respect to a proposed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Loans at an interest rate based on Adjusted Term SOFR (or such replacement convention) shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice and during such time, all such outstanding Loans shall bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (or at the Default Rate if an Event of Default has occurred that is continuing). Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of Loans bearing interest at Adjusted Term SOFR (or such replacement convention) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (or at the Default Rate if an Event of Default has occurred that is continuing) in the amount specified therein. 

(b) If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted in writing that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any Loan, or to determine or charge interest rates, in each case, based upon Adjusted Term SOFR, or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to such Loan, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Loan or continue Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Until such circumstances giving rise to the determination no longer exist, as set forth in a written notice provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, all outstanding Loans of such Lender and Loans thereafter made by such Lender shall bear interest at the Base Rate plus Applicable Rate plus 2.00 per annum (or at the Default Rate if an Event of Default has occurred that is continuing) in the amount specified therein. 

3.03 Increased Costs . 

(a) Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall: 

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender; 

59

(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 

(iii) impose on any Lender any other condition (other than any condition related to Taxes), cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or participation therein; 

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 

(b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 

(d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 

3.04 Compensation for Losses . Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of (a) any continuation, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, or automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise); (b) any failure by a Credit Party (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay or borrow any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower e or (c) any assignment of a Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13 , including any loss of anticipated profits but including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained (all of such losses, costs or expenses, together with any administrative fees referred to in the following sentence, are referred to herein collectively as the Breakage Costs ). The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.04 , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Loan made by such Lender through a matching deposit for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Loan was in fact so funded. 

60

3.05 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . 

(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.03 , or requires a Credit Party to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.03 , then at the request of the Borrower such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.03 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.03 , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender as the case may be (it being understood that the Borrower shall be given a reasonable opportunity to reimburse such costs or expenses). The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 

(b) Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.03 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.05(a) , the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13 . 

3.06 Survival . All of the Borrower s obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent.
