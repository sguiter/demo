 Licensing Revenue 
 Licensing revenue includes initial territory fees, Shack opening fees and ongoing sales-based royalty fees from licensed Shacks. Generally, the licenses granted to develop, open and operate each Shack in a specified territory are the predominant good or service transferred to the licensee and represent distinct performance obligations. Ancillary promised services, such as training and assistance during the initial opening of a Shack, are typically combined with the license and considered one performance obligation per Shack. 
 The Company determines the transaction price for each contract, which requires judgement as the transaction price is comprised of the initial territory fee and an estimate of the total Shack opening fees based on the estimated number of Shacks the Company expects the licensee to open. The transaction price is then allocated equally to each Shack expected to open. The performance obligation is satisfied over time, starting when a Shack opens through the end of the license term for the related Shack, therefore revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the license term. 
 Generally, payment for the initial territory fee is received upon execution of the license agreement and payment for the Shack opening fees is received either in advance of or upon opening the related Shack. These payments are initially deferred and recognized in revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue from sales-based royalties is recognized as the related sales occur.

 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include long-lived assets, operating lease right-of-use assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company performs its impairment analysis at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. There were impairment charges recognized during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023. 
 On August 27, 2024, the Company determined to close and executed the closure of underperforming Company-operated Shacks in California, Ohio and Texas as these Shacks were not projected to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future, in part due to changes in the trade area and the negative impact on other Shacks within their proximity by cannibalizing sales. The total expenses related to the identified Shack closures were for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, of which was impairment expense, related to right-of-use assets, and property, plant and equipment, and was miscellaneous Shack closure expense. The fair values of assets were determined using an income-based approach and are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Significant inputs include projections of future cash flows, discount rates, Shack sales, profitability, and sublease income. 
 Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company continues working with the landlords to negotiate lease terminations for the Shack closures.

Upon conversion, the Company pays or delivers, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at the Company's election. 
 The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2027, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company's Class A common stock, par value per share, for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price for the Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the business day period after any consecutive trading day period (the measurement period in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per one thousand dollar principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of Class A common stock and the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls such Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the Convertible Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; and (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the Indenture. On or after December 1, 2027, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.

 to years and typically include renewal options. Renewal options are generally not recognized as part of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as it is not reasonably certain at commencement date that the Company would exercise the renewal options. Real estate leases typically contain fixed minimum rent payments and/or contingent rent payments which are based upon sales in excess of specified thresholds. When the achievement of such sales thresholds are deemed to be probable, contingent rent is accrued in proportion to the sales recognized during the period. 
 For operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) in the following line items. Lease expense incurred before a Shack opens is recorded in Pre-opening costs. Once a Company-operated Shack opens, the straight-line lease expense and contingent rent, if applicable, are recorded in Occupancy and related expenses. Many of these leases also require the Company to pay real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs and other occupancy costs which are included in Occupancy and related expenses. Finance leases are recognized in depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the lease liability.

 The increase in the effective income tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2024 was primarily driven by a decline in pre-tax income and consistent non-deductible expenses, which together contributed to the higher effective rate. 
 The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 was primarily driven by a decline in pre-tax income and higher tax credits applied against our estimated income tax liability, leading to a year-to-date tax benefit.

 The Company also recognizes deferred tax assets related to additional tax basis increases generated from expected future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and related deductions for imputed interest on such payments. Refer to "Tax Receivable Agreement," herein for additional information. 
 
 The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establishes valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. As of September 25, 2024, the Company concluded, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, that all of its deferred tax assets (except for those deferred tax assets relating to certain state tax credits and net operating losses) are more likely than not to be realized. As such, additional valuation allowance was recognized. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 On February 4, 2015, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement with certain of the then-existing members of SSE Holdings (the "Tax Receivable Agreement") that provides for the payment by the Company of of the amount of any tax benefits that are actually realized, or in some cases are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in the Company's share of the tax basis in the net assets of SSE Holdings resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests, (ii) tax basis increases attributable to payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (iii) deductions attributable to imputed interest pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement (the "TRA Payments"). The Company expects to benefit from the remaining of any tax benefits that may actually realize. The TRA Payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in SSE Holdings or the Company. The rights of each member of SSE Holdings that is a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement, are assignable to transferees of their respective LLC Interests. 
 Pursuant to the Company's election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of SSE Holdings when LLC Interests are redeemed or exchanged by the other members of SSE Holdings. The Company plans to make an election under Section 754 of the Code for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC Interest occurs. The Company intends to treat any redemptions and exchanges of LLC Interests as direct purchases of LLC Interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that would otherwise be paid in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. 
 Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) future changes in tax laws. There were no transactions subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement for which the Company did not recognize the related liability, as the Company concluded that it would have sufficient future taxable income to utilize all of the related tax benefits generated by all transactions that occurred during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023.

The following definitions apply to these terms as used herein: 
 
 "Average weekly sales" is calculated by dividing total Shack sales by the number of operating weeks for all Shacks in operation during the period. For Shacks that are not open for the entire period, fractional adjustments are made to the number of operating weeks open such that it corresponds to the period of associated sales. 
 "Same-Shack sales" represents Shack sales for the comparable Shack base, which is defined as the number of Company-operated Shacks open for 24 full fiscal months or longer. For consecutive days that Shacks were temporarily closed, the comparative period was also adjusted. 
 System-wide sales is an operating measure and consists of sales from Company-operated Shacks and licensed Shacks. The Company does not recognize the sales from licensed Shacks as revenue. Of these amounts, revenue is limited to licensing revenue based on a percentage of sales from licensed Shacks, as well as certain up-front fees, such as territory fees and opening fees. 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 Same-Shack sales for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2024 increased 4.4 compared to the same period last year, driven by a 4.1 increase in price mix and a 0.3 increase in guest traffic. Same-Shack sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 increased 3.4 compared to the same period last year, driven by a 4.2 increase in price mix partially offset by a 0.8 decline in guest traffic. For the purpose of calculating same-Shack sales for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, Shack sales for 227 Shacks were included in the comparable Shack base. 
 Average weekly sales were 76,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2024, compared to 74,000 for the same period last year, primarily driven by higher menu prices, partially offset by menu mix. Average weekly sales were 75,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, which was flat compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by higher menu prices, partially offset by a decline in guest traffic and menu mix. 
 System-wide sales for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2024 increased 12.8 to 495.1 million compared to the same period last year. System-wide sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 increased 12.9 to 1,422.1 million compared to the same period last year. 
 Digital sales for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2024 increased 25.4 to 104.3 million compared to the same period last year. Digital sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 increased 20.4 to 312.6 million compared to the same period last year. Digital sales includes orders placed on the Shake Shack app, website and third-party delivery platforms, which represented 34.2 and 35.1 , respectively, of Shack sales during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024.

 Depreciation and amortization expense for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2024 increased 11.2 to 25.7 million versus the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to incremental depreciation of capital expenditures related to the opening of 39 new Company-operated Shacks between September 27, 2023 and September 25, 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 increased 14.9 to 76.7 million versus the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned item as well as incremental depreciation of technology projects placed into service. 
 Pre-Opening Costs 
 Pre-opening costs consist primarily of occupancy, manager and team member wages, cookware, travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other supporting team members, marketing expenses, legal fees and inventory costs incurred prior to the opening of a Shack. All such costs incurred prior to the opening of a Company-operated Shack are expensed in the period in which the expense was incurred. Pre-opening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of Company-operated Shack openings and the specific pre-opening costs incurred for each Company-operated Shack. Additionally, Company-operated Shack openings in new geographic markets may initially experience higher pre-opening costs than our established geographic markets, such as the New York City metropolitan area, where we have greater economies of scale and incur lower travel and lodging costs for our training team.

The decreases for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 were primarily due to reductions in wages and team costs as we standardize the training process for unopened Shacks as well as reductions in legal costs compared to the prior year period. 
 Impairments, loss on disposal of assets, and Shack closures 
 Impairments, loss on disposal of assets, and Shack closures primarily consists of the net book value of assets that have been retired which primarily consists of furniture, equipment and fixtures that were replaced in the normal course of business; impairment charges related to our long-lived assets, which includes property and equipment, as well as operating and finance lease assets; and miscellaneous Shack closure expenses, including employee-related costs, cleaning, and sign removal costs.

 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 We are the sole managing member of SSE Holdings and, as a result, consolidate the financial results of SSE Holdings. SSE Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, SSE Holdings is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by SSE Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including us, on a pro rata basis.

 We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss of SSE Holdings, as well as any stand-alone income or loss generated by us. We are also subject to withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.

 Our effective income tax rates for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023 were 25.9 and 6.1 , respectively. The increase was primarily driven by a decline in pre-tax income and consistent non-deductible expenses, which together contributed to the higher effective rate. Our effective income tax rates for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023 were (13.9) and 11.3 , respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in pre-tax income (loss) and higher tax credits applied against our estimated income tax liability, leading to a year-to-date tax benefit. The Company's ownership interest in SSE Holdings is directly related to its share of the taxable income of SSE Holdings. Our weighted average ownership interest in SSE Holdings was 94.2 and 93.3 , respectively, for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023, and 93.7 and 93.3 , respectively, for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023. These increases in the Company's ownership interest in SSE Holdings LLC increased its share of the taxable income (loss) of SSE Holdings. 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests 
 We are the sole managing member of SSE Holdings and have the sole voting power in, and control the management of, SSE Holdings. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial results of SSE Holdings and report a non-controlling interest on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), representing the portion of net income (loss) attributable to the other members of SSE Holdings. The Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of SSE Holdings provides that holders of LLC Interests may, from time to time, require SSE Holdings to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Interests for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. In connection with any redemption or exchange, we will receive a corresponding number of LLC Interests, increasing our total ownership interest in SSE Holdings. The weighted average ownership percentages for the applicable reporting periods are used to attribute net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) to Shake Shack Inc. and the non-controlling interest holders.

 Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2024 declined to a loss of 0.9 million from income of 0.5 million in the same period last year. Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 declined to nil from 0.7 million in the same period last year. The declines in Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 were primarily due to decreases in net results compared to the same periods last year, partially offset by a decrease in the non-controlling interest holders' weighted average ownership, which was 5.8 and 6.3 , respectively, for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 and 6.7 for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 To supplement the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Restaurant-level profit, Restaurant-level profit margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share (collectively the "non-GAAP financial measures").

 Restaurant-Level Profit 
 Restaurant-level profit, formerly referred to as Shack-level operating profit, is defined as Shack sales less Shack-level operating expenses which include Food and paper costs, Labor and related expenses, Other operating expenses and Occupancy and related expenses. 
 How This Measure Is Useful 
 When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, Restaurant-level profit and Restaurant-level profit margin are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to evaluate the performance and profitability of our Shacks. Additionally, Restaurant-level profit and Restaurant-level profit margin are key metrics used internally by our management to develop internal budgets and forecasts, as well as assess the performance of our Shacks relative to budget and against prior periods. It is also used to evaluate team member compensation as it serves as a metric in certain of our performance-based team member bonus arrangements. We believe the presentation of Restaurant-level profit and Restaurant-level profit margin provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that can provide meaningful insights to the underlying operating performance of our Shacks, as these measures depict the operating results that are directly impacted by our Shacks and exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the ongoing operations of our Shacks. It may also assist investors to evaluate our performance relative to peers of various sizes and maturities and provides greater transparency with respect to how our management evaluates our business, as well as our financial and operational decision-making. 
 Limitations of the Usefulness of this Measure 
 Restaurant-level profit and Restaurant-level profit margin may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of Restaurant-level profit and Restaurant-level profit margin is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant-level profit excludes certain costs, such as General and administrative expenses and Pre-opening costs, which are considered normal, recurring cash operating expenses and are essential to support the operation and development of our Shacks. Therefore, this measure may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of our Company as a whole and Restaurant-level profit and Restaurant-level profit margin should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of Restaurant-level profit to Income (loss) from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows.

 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) before Interest expense (net of interest income), Income tax expense (benefit) and Depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding equity-based compensation expense, Impairments, loss on disposal of assets, and Shack closures, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs, as well as certain non-recurring items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring business operations. 
 How These Measures Are Useful 
 When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to historical performance and competitors' operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used internally by our management to develop internal budgets and forecasts and also serves as a metric in our performance-based equity incentive programs and certain of our bonus arrangements. We believe presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that facilitates analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. 
 Limitations of the Usefulness of These Measures 
 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA exclude certain normal recurring expenses. Therefore, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of our performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to Net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows.

 Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share 
 Adjusted pro forma net income represents Net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc. assuming the full exchange of all outstanding SSE Holdings, LLC membership interests ("LLC Interests") for shares of Class A common stock, adjusted for certain non-recurring items that we do not believe are directly related to our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring business operations. Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pro forma net income by the weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based awards. 
 How These Measures Are Useful 
 When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to our competitors. By assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, we believe these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies that have different organizational and tax structures, as well as comparisons period over period because it eliminates the effect of any changes in Net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc. driven by increases in our ownership of SSE Holdings, which are unrelated to our operating performance, and excludes items that are non-recurring or may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. 
 Limitations of the Usefulness of These Measures 
 Adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share should not be considered alternatives to Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share, as determined under GAAP. While these measures are useful in evaluating our performance, they do not account for the earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest holders and therefore do not provide a complete understanding of the Net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc. Adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share should be evaluated in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to Net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are set forth below.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand, short-term investments and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 25, 2024, we maintained a Cash and cash equivalents balance of 310.9 million. In March 2021, we issued 0 Convertible Senior Notes Convertible Notes ), and received 243.8 million of proceeds, net of discounts. Refer to Note 6, Debt, in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 On June 6, 2024, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC which permits us to issue a combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings from time to time. To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the capital markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may affect our ability to access those markets or increase the costs associated with issuing debt or equity instruments. 
 Our primary requirements for liquidity are to fund our working capital needs, operating and finance lease obligations, capital expenditures and general corporate needs. Our requirements for working capital are generally not significant because our guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or on debit or credit cards at the time of the sale and we are able to sell many of our inventory items before payment is due to the supplier of such items. Our ongoing capital expenditures are principally related to opening new Shacks, existing Shack capital investments (both for remodels and maintenance), as well as investments in our corporate technology infrastructure to support our home office, Shake Shack locations, and digital strategy. 
 In addition, we are obligated to make payments to certain members of SSE Holdings under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As of September 25, 2024, such obligations totaled 247.8 million. Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although the amount of any payments that must be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be significant, the timing of these payments will vary and will generally be limited to one payment per member per year. The amount of such payments are also limited to the extent we utilize the related deferred tax assets. The payments that we are required to make will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to SSE Holdings, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related deferred tax assets to fund the required payments. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating and finance lease obligations, capital expenditures, Tax Receivable Agreement obligations and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

Table of Contents 

 Operating Activities 
 For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 126.1 million compared to 90.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, an increase of 35.5 million. The increase was primarily driven by a 21.8 million improvement in net results after excluding non-cash charges as well as changes in working capital of 13.7 million. The changes in working capital included an increase in liabilities related to marketing promotions and a change in the timing and payments related to accruals, partially offset by an increase in payments on lease liabilities due to the opening of 30 net new Company-operated Shacks between September 27, 2023 and September 25, 2024 and higher base rent. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 31.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 126.3 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, a decrease of 94.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to a net increase in marketable securities activity of 163.4 million, due to the timing of purchases and maturities of held-to-maturity securities in fiscal 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the sale of equity securities of 81.5 million in the prior year. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 8.5 million compared to 4.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, an increase of 3.7 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in withholding taxes related to net settled equity awards. 
 Convertible Notes 
 In March 2021, we issued 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election. Refer to Note 6, Debt, in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 In August 2019, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in March 2026 and permits borrowings up to 50.0 million, with the ability to increase available borrowings up to an additional 100.0 million, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Facility also permits the issuance of letters of credit upon our request of up to 15.0 million. 
 In June 2023, the Company entered into the fourth amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility ("Fourth Amendment"), which, among other things, modified the benchmark interest rate to either: (i) the base rate plus applicable margin ranging from 0.0 to 1.5 or (ii) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus applicable margin ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 , in each case depending on the net lease adjusted leverage ratio. As of September 25, 2024 and December 27, 2023, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of SSE Holdings and the guarantors. The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by each of SSE Holdings' direct and indirect subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with maximum net lease adjusted leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, as well as other customary affirmative and negative covenants. As of September 25, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of operating and finance lease obligations, long-term debt, liabilities under the Tax Receivable Agreement and purchase obligations. The timing and nature of these commitments are expected to have an impact on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods. Refer to Note 6, Debt and Note 7, Leases, in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 for additional information relating to our long-term debt and operating and financing leases.

 Liabilities under the Tax Receivable Agreement include amounts to be paid to the non-controlling interest holders, assuming we will have sufficient taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the related tax benefits. Refer to Note 10, Income Taxes, in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, for additional information relating to our Tax Receivable Agreement and related liabilities. 
 Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts, including commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities, firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. The majority of our purchase obligations are due within the next 12 months. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions, which we believe to be reasonable, based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Variances in the estimates or assumptions used to actual experience could yield materially different accounting results. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2023. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks as described in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Based upon the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 25, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified in fiscal 2023, as described below. 
 42 | Shake Shack Inc. Form 10-Q 

Table of Contents 

 PREVIOUSLY REPORTED MATERIAL WEAKNESS 
 As previously disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2023, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the calculation of state deferred taxes and the related income tax expense (benefit). Specifically, the internal controls in place with respect to the calculation of state deferred taxes and the related income tax expense (benefit) were not designed appropriately. The material weakness existed as of December 27, 2023 and prior periods. 
 
 Management identified and reported this weakness to both our audit committee and Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, immediately upon identification. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 REMEDIATION STATUS OF MATERIAL WEAKNESS 
 We are designing and implementing measures to remediate the material weakness noted above and to enhance our internal control over financial reporting. As previously disclosed, we have established a Steering Committee with representatives from key departments within our Finance organization as well as representatives from IT and Securities Counsel and we have continued our remediation activities. We have hired a Head of Tax with over 20 years of tax leadership experience including working with Up-C structures, enhancing controls, processes, and tax technology. The new Head of Tax has completed an assessment of the tax function and has developed a strategy to enhance our tax technology and transformation. We continue to supplement our tax resources through the use of third-party tax consultants and intend to utilize the third-party tax consultants, under the supervision of management, throughout the remediation process. In addition, we are in the process of developing enhanced management review control procedures over the calculation of state deferred taxes and the related income tax expense (benefit). Additionally, we have begun executing our strategy with third-party tax consultants to enhance our tax process through the implementation of tax technology which we believe will strengthen our controls. 
 
 The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight of the audit committee of our board of directors. The material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and make any further changes management deems appropriate. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 Except as described above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 25, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
