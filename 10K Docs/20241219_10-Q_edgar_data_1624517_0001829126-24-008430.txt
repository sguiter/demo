Emerging Growth Company 

We are and we will remain an emerging growth company as defined under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act ), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed 1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a large accelerated filer (with at least 700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 

As an emerging growth company , we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis disclosure; 

reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 

no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 

exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 

We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a smaller reporting company , meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than 250 million and annual revenues of less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a smaller reporting company , at such time as we cease being an emerging growth company , the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company . Specifically, similar to emerging growth companies , smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act SOX requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. 

Employees 

The Company currently has approximately twenty-five full-time and part time employees, including officers and directors. Our employees are not represented by any labor union. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item.

 (Unaudited) 

of the membership interests of ReachOut were exchanged for Series C Preferred Stock which is convertible into 87.5 of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (fully diluted basis) as determined at the consummation of the acquisition. 

The Share Exchange is intended to constitute a reorganization with the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended). 

As a result of the transaction, ReachOut became a subsidiary of the Company. 

The Company evaluated the substance of the merger transaction and found it met the criteria for the accounting and reporting treatment of a reverse acquisition under ASC 805 (Business Combinations)-40-45 (Reverse Acquisition and Other Presentation Matters) and accordingly will consolidate the operations of ReachOut and the Company and the financial condition from the closing date of the transaction. The historic results of operations will reflect those of ReachOut. As such, ReachOut is treated as the acquirer while the Company is treated as the acquired entity for accounting and financial reporting purposes. 

Under reverse merger accounting, the comparative historical financial statements of the Company, as the legal acquirer, are those of the accounting acquirer, ReachOut, the Company s financial statements prior to the closing of the reverse acquisition; reflect only the business of ReachOut and its subsidiaries. 

For accounting purposes, ReachOut is considered the acquirer of YCRM. based upon the terms of the Merger as well as other factors including; (i) RO former shareholders own approximately 87.5 of the combined Company s outstanding common shares (giving effect to the conversion of the preferred Series C shares ReachOut stockholders received in exchange for the ReachOut stock) immediately following the closing of the Merger, and (ii ReachOut management hold key management positions of the combined Company. The Merger has therefore recorded as a reverse acquisition. The figures described in the notes and financial statements are a continuation of the figures of the legal subsidiary or accounting acquirer (ReachOut). However, the equity reflects the legal acquirer, or accounting acquiree (YCRM) equity structure. The acquisition value is recorded to reflect the par value of the outstanding shares of the Company, including the number of shares issued in the reverse acquisition and has been recast to reflect the merger transactions as if it had occurred as of the earliest period presented. Any difference is recognized as an adjustment to the additional paid in capital to the extent available, and then as a retained earnings adjustment. 

Under the terms of the Control Block Transfer Agreement, Everett Dickson (former CEO) sold all his remaining Series A Preferred Stock to Richard Jordan (new CEO) for . 

Following the closing of the agreements, Robert Bohorad and Everett Dickson resigned their positions as CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, respectively and Richard Jordan was appointed to those positions. 

The Company has authorized Series C Preferred Shares of Stock, effective December 13, 2023. The shares have a stated value of per share, earns a 2 dividend on the stated value, which is cumulative and payable solely upon redemption. The stock has voting rights equal to the number of common shares into which the preferred shares may be converted. At any time following 180 days from the date of issuance the preferred stock in aggregate can be converted into 87.5 of the outstanding common stock for a period of twenty-four months from the date of issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock. 

Under the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement the Company issued shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the owners of ReachOut. in exchange for of the shares of ReachOut upon closing the aforementioned acquisition.

These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations. In the event that the Company cannot generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations, the Company will need to reduce expenses or obtain financing through the sale of debt and/or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company would be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material, adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities as a result of this uncertainty.

The following required disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of each class of financial instruments are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, and Accounts Payable. The items are generally short-term in nature, and accordingly, the carrying amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable approximations of their fair values. 

The carrying amounts of notes payable approximate the fair value as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates. 

The table below classifies the Company s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries Operating Companies are not selling or leasing software to customers. The operating companies provide managed IT services (managing customers networks including security, support user needs and network infrastructure), and installation (cabling and network hardware and third-party software set up). Agreements such as the Master Consulting Services Agreement are entered into by the operating companies and their clients. These agreements provide the general terms of service and the legal matters essential to the agreement. The agreements are supplemented by Statements of Work (SOW) which spell specific services and any hardware to be provided. Invoices are prepared based on the terms of the SOW either monthly for services to be rendered for the coming month or based on installation progress estimates, collectively the billings are based on performance obligations. Revenue from invoiced billings is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Company s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or services to customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. 

It is management s practice to only invoice for services and goods to be provided within the coming month. While services may not be fully transferred the client is in fact obligated to pay the invoiced amount unless the contract is terminated with prior notice. 

The Company manages its operating income on a regional basis at the present time. Revenue recognized for the Northeast region was , and for the Southeast region for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 modifies the reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily by requiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, ASU 2023-07: (i) enhances interim disclosure requirements, (ii) clarifies the circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple measures of a segment s profit or loss, (iii) provides new segment disclosure requirements for public entities with a single reportable segment, and (iv) requires that a public entity disclose the title and position of the chief operating decision maker CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements 

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which is intended to address issues identified during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendment, among other things, eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors , while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. This adoption did not have a material effect to the Company. 

In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Company s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on February 13, 2020 and the adoption did not have any impact on its financial statements. 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, the Company will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances.

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. The Company has not generated profits since inception, has sustained net losses of 10,660,143, for the
six months ended June 30, 2024, and has incurred negative cash flows from operations for the period. As of June 30, 2024,
the working capital deficit, stockholders deficit, and accumulated deficit was 31,252,329, 32,936,041 and 35,643,815
respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months is dependent upon its ability to generate
sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations. In the event that the Company cannot generate sufficient revenue to
sustain its operations, the Company will need to reduce expenses or obtain financing through the sale of debt and/or equity
securities. The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain
additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company would be
unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material, adverse effect
on the business, financial condition, and results of operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities as a result of this
uncertainty.
