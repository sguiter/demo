This amount is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses. Available-for-sale debt securities are typically classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest. When available-for-sale debt securities are placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively and was reported in the line item accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the yield (interest income) of the related loans. The Company is amortizing these amounts over the contractual life of the loan. Premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized as adjustments to interest income using the effective yield method. The loans receivable portfolio is segmented into commercial and industrial, which are typically utilized for general business purposes and commercial real estate, which are collaterized by real estate. Homogenouse loans consisting similar products that are smaller in amount and distributed over a large number of individual borrowers include residential real estate and consumer loans. For all classes of loans receivable, the accrual of interest is discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Interest generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income on a cash basis, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time (generally six months), and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. The past-due status of all classes of loans receivable is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments.

 that meet the following criteria: 1) when it is determined that foreclosure is probable, 2) substandard, doubtful and nonperforming loans when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, 3) when it is determined by management that a loan does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. Specific reserves are established based on the following three acceptable methods for measuring the ACL: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate; 2) the loan s observable market price; or 3) the fair value of the collateral when the loan is collateral dependent. Our individual loan evaluations consist primarily of the fair value of collateral method because most of our loans are collateral dependent. Collateral values are discounted to consider disposition costs when appropriate. A specific reserve is established or a charge-off is taken if the fair value of the loan is less than the loan balance. , net of tax, of which related to loans, related to unfunded commitments. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 326 related to presenting other-than-temporary impairment on available-for-sale debt securities prior to January 1, 2023 using the prospective transition approach, though no such charges had been recorded on the securities held by the Company as of the date of adoption. The Company did not change the segmentation from the incurred loss method upon adoption of ASC 326.

Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be indicative of credit losses at September 30, 2024.

 and at December 31, 2023. The risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows: Commercial and Industrial, and Commercial Real Estate Commercial loans are primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and may include a personal guarantee. Short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The characteristics of properties securing the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse, but with geographic location almost entirely in the Company s market area. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. In general, the Company avoids financing single purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate versus nonowner-occupied loans. Residential Real Estate and Consumer Residential real estate and consumer loans consist of two segments - residential mortgage loans and personal loans. For residential mortgage loans that are secured by 1-4 family residences and are generally owner-occupied, the Company generally establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded. Home equity loans are typically secured by a subordinate interest in 1-4 family residences, and consumer personal loans are secured by consumer personal assets, such as automobiles or recreational vehicles. Some consumer personal loans are unsecured, such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas, such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in property values on residential properties. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.

The four categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter. Pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not have identified potential or well defined weaknesses and for which there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated periodically based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. All other categories are updated on at least a quarterly basis. The Company assigns a special mention rating to loans that have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the Company s credit position. The Company assigns a substandard rating to loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans have well defined weaknesses or weaknesses that could jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt. Loans and leases in this grade also are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies noted are not addressed and corrected. The Company assigns a doubtful rating to loans that have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceeding, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans.

Occasionally, the Bank modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing term extension, other-than-significant payment delay or interest rate reduction. In some cases, the Bank provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as an interest rate reduction, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as term extension, may be granted. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank did not grant any loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

 United Bancorp, Inc. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discusses the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, and the results of consolidated operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included herein. Introduction Our Company reported diluted earnings per share of 0.31 and net income of 1,820,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the first nine months of the current year, UBCP reported diluted earnings per share of 0.95 and net income of 5,553,000. We are happy to report on the solid earnings and, overall, stable performance of United Bancorp, Inc. (UBCP) for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and year to date. For the quarter, our Company produced net income and diluted earnings per share results of 1,820,000 and 0.31, which were respective decreases of 573,000 and 0.11 from the results achieved for the third quarter of the previous year. But, on a linked-quarter basis, net income and diluted earnings per share respectively increased by 81,000, or 4.6 , and 0.01, or 3.3 , over the same levels achieved the prior quarter. For the first nine months of 2024, UBCP produced net income and diluted earnings per share of 5,553,000 and 0.95, which were respective decreases of 1,007,000 and 0.20 compared to the results achieved for the same period in 2023. As we navigated the first nine months of 2024, our Company, like most companies operating in the financial services industry, are fighting the battle of both net interest margin compression and limited or decreasing growth as interest rates remained elevated and economic activity was sluggish. As we started the current year, the interest rate forecast by most economists and the financial markets indicated that we could expect up to seven rate cuts throughout the year, which, overall, was projected to be favorable for our industry as it would help control funding costs. As we progressed through the first nine months of the current year and ended the third quarter, interest rates have been higher for longer than anticipated, with the potential of fewer rate cuts this year. Although the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve (FOMC) did finally cut the target for the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) by fifty-basis points toward the end of the most recently ended quarter, monetary policy is still more restrictive than forecast at the beginning of the year as of September 30, 2024 and is creating challenges for our industry by putting pressure on the net interest margins and bottom-line performances of many financial institutions. In addition, it has also been challenging for many financial institutions to grow their balance sheets and optimally leverage their capital as economic activity has been relatively weak overall; thus, having a negative impact on loan demand and growth in loans outstanding, which has been in the low to mid-single digits for many financial institutions in the current year. Our Company is not immune from these challenges influenced by current monetary policy and macroeconomic trends as seen in our performance for the current quarter and year-to-date in 2024 in comparison to the same periods in the previous year, which were some of the highest performing periods in our Company s history. Regardless of these challenges and all things considered at present, we are generally satisfied with the current performance of our Company. We believe that these challenges will be short-lived and will be overcome as we execute on some of our strategic objectives and get a return on current capital investments over the course of the next twelve to twenty-four months, which should lead to higher levels of growth and improved performance in future periods.

 At September 30, 2024 and as previously mentioned, in the presently uncertain economic environment in which we are operating, it has been a challenge to profitably leverage our balance sheet and, accordingly, UBCP has only achieved marginal growth in assets in the current year. As of September 30, 2024, our Company s total average assets were 826.2 million, an increase of 19.0 million, or 2.4 , year-over-year. For this same period, our Company s average loans increased by 20.4 million, or 4.4 , to a level of 480.8 million. Also, as of the most recently ended quarter, our Company saw an increase in its average investment securities of 13.4 million, or 5.5 , over the previous year to a level of 259.3 million. With this marginally higher level of earning assets and our loans outstanding continuing to reprice in a higher interest rate environment, we were able to increase the total level of total interest income that our Company generated by 2.3 million, or 8.5 , for the first nine months of the current year relative to last year. But, this year-over-year increase in total interest income was more than offset by the increase in total interest expense experienced by UBCP. At September 30, 2024, our Company s total interest expense increased year-over-year by 3.2 million, or 40.7 , even though average total deposits decreased by 19.6) million, or (3.1 ), as of the most recently ended quarter. The increase in our Company s total interest expense can be attributed to both the change in the mix of our retail depository funding from lower cost demand and savings balances to higher cost term funding, along with having a previously disclosed 75.0 million Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Advance which we originated in mid-March 2023 for the entirety of this year. Relating to the change in the mix of our retail funding, lower cost demand and savings balances decreased by 40.6) million, or (8.3 ), while higher cost time balances increased by 28.4 million or 20.4 . Accordingly, year-over-year, the level of net interest income that we achieved declined by 880,000), or (4.6 ), to a level of 18.5 million and our net interest margin declined by 13 basis points from 3.63 to 3.50 . During the third quarter of 2024, our Company was able to better control the level of decline of its net interest margin experiencing a decrease on a linked quarter basis of four basis points. We are optimistic that we will be able to overcome this trend in the coming quarters as the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) becomes less restrictive and, hopefully, helps us lower our overall funding costs. Lastly relating to our retail deposit base and of significance our Company does not have any brokered deposits and total uninsured deposits as of September 30, 2024 totaled 18.4 of total deposits, which are both very low compared to industry standards and strongly indicative of our Company s focus on building strong relationships with long-term, core deposits. Even with the continued heightened inflation levels and related increases in interest rates that may be impacting some of our borrowers with higher operating costs and rate resets to higher interest rate levels on their loans, we have successfully maintained credit-related strength and stability within our loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our Company s total nonaccrual loans and loans past due 30 plus days were 1.0 million, or 0.21 of gross loans, which is up from last year by 295,000 but, down on a linked-quarter basis by 142,000 or 2 basis points. Also, as of the most recently ended quarter, United Bancorp, Inc. s (UBCP) nonperforming assets to total assets was a very respectable 0.46 , a 1 basis point increase from last year and the same level as last quarter. Further highlighting the overall strength of our loan portfolio, our Company had net loans charged off of (excluding overdrafts of 141,000), which annualized is (0.04 of average loans and primarily related to a single relationship. With some of the economic uncertainty and macroeconomic trends at present, our Company had a provision for credit loss expense of 69,000 for the quarter and 174,000 year-to-date (versus a negative provision for credit loss expense the previous year for each period), which are respective increases of 223,000 for the quarter and 474,000 year-over-year. For the quarter-end and nine months ended September 30, 2024, this year-over-year increase in the provision for credit loss expense caused a decrease in our Company s diluted earnings per share for the quarter of 0.03 and for the year of approximately 0.07. With the increased provision for credit loss expense in the current year and continued solid credit quality-related metrics, our Company s total allowance for credit losses to total loans of 0.84 and its total allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 1,053 as of September 30, 2024. Overall, we firmly believe that we are presently well reserved with very strong coverage. In addition, our Company remains very well capitalized by industry standards seeing its tangible shareholders equity increase year-over-year by 13.0 million, or 25.2 , to a level of 64.6 million (up by 4.9, or 8.3 , on a linked-quarter basis) and its tangible book value per share increase by 2.07, or 23.6 (up 0.80, or 7.9 , on a linked-quarter basis), to a level of 10.84 at the most recently ended quarter. Also, as of September 30, 2024, UBCP s equity to assets increased by 1.48 year-over-year to a level of 7.94.

 United Bancorp, Inc. (UBCP), like most banking organizations, has felt the pressure of operating in an environment wherein monetary policy has driven interest rates higher for a longer duration than many of us anticipated which has created different challenges for us and most banks. Fortunately, we are hopeful that the unwinding of the restrictive monetary policy that began toward the end of this most recent quarter by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will help alleviate some of this pressure in the coming quarters; especially, relating to our cost of deposit pricing and the impact that it has had on our net interest margin, among other things. Overall, we are very happy with the solid financial performance that our Company achieved during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. As previously mentioned, even though UBCP experienced solid year-over-year growth in the level of total interest income that it generated for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Company experienced a greater increase in the total interest expense that it incurred, which caused the aforementioned decline in our net interest income. Fortunately for our Company, taking the 75.0 million advance from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) toward the end of the first quarter of last year, to this point, has helped us to somewhat mitigate this decline in our net interest income by affording us the ability to be more selective in the pricing of our offering rates on our interest-bearing depository products while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity. With a present net interest margin of 3.50 as of September 30, 2024, we believe that this performance metric compares favorably to that of our peer group and industry at present. With the current pressure on our net interest margin and net interest income, United Bancorp, Inc. (UBCP) is focused on controlling its net noninterest margin while continuing with a focus of prudently growing our Company and remaining relevant in a very challenging and competitive environment. Regarding the noninterest income-side of the noninterest margin, some fee generating services and lines of business continue to be under attack by both regulatory and political authorities, which has ultimately put pressure on the level of noninterest income that our Company is able to realize. Accordingly (and, instead of dwelling on this negative reality), UBCP is looking to find new alternatives to generate additional levels of both noninterest income and other sources of revenue. One of these new alternatives is our focus on enhancing our mortgage origination function with the development of Unified Mortgage, which is beginning to help our Company generate higher levels of fee income with the heightened production and sale of secondary market mortgage products, along with the enhancement of our interest income levels through the origination of higher levels of portfolio-type mortgage products. In this area, year-over-year, our Company has experienced an increase of 355,000 on the net realized gain on the sale of loans and we anticipate the level of income to grow in this business-line as we further scale this revenue generating function, which has a tremendous level of positive operating leverage at present. Another alternative is our stronger commitment to developing our Treasury Management function, which offers fee-based services to our commercial customers in the areas of cash management and payments that produce noninterest income in addition to helping to control interest expense by generating a higher level of low or no-cost depository balances for our Company. Lastly, another alternative to enhancing the overall performance of UBCP (and, one that should strongly contribute to our Company attaining its goal of growing its total assets to a level of 1.0 billion or greater) is the development of our newest banking center, which is currently under construction in the highly favorable market of Wheeling, West Virginia and should be completed for opening in the third quarter of 2025. Our Company already has many solid customer relationships in this coveted marketplace and we firmly believe that by finally having a brick-and-mortar location therein, we will be able to more fully leverage these already existing relationships, while having the opportunity to build many new relationships within this prime market. Obviously, these new alternatives that can lead to additional noninterest income and revenue enhancement opportunities for UBCP do have a cost, which already has and will continue to lead to additional expense or overhead for our Company. But, sometimes you have to take one-step back in order to take several-steps forward and that is what we firmly believe that we are doing by undertaking these new initiatives. With the revenue challenges that both we and the players within our industry are currently facing, we strongly feel that now is the time for our Company to focus on enhancing and expanding existing lines of business and growing new lines of business thus, achieving the organic growth that will lead to the continued and future relevance of UBCP. Our primary focus is protecting the investment of our shareholders in our Company and rewarding them in a balanced fashion by growing their value and paying an attractive cash dividend. In these areas, our shareholders have been nicely rewarded. In the first nine months of 2024, we, once again, paid both our regular cash dividend, which increased by 0.03 to a level of 0.5250, and a special cash dividend of 0.15 for a total payout of 0.6750 in the current year. This is an increase for the quarter and the year of 0.01, or 6.0 , and 0.03, or 4.7 , respectively. This total dividend payout level for the current year produces a near-industry leading total dividend yield of 6.4 . This total dividend yield is based on our third quarter cash dividend on a forward basis, plus the special dividend (which combined total 0.86) and our quarter-end fair market value of 13.13. On a year-over-year basis as of September 30, 2024, the fair market value of our Company s stock was up 1.58, or 13.7 , from the prior year and our Company s market price to tangible book value was 121 , which compares favorably to our peer group.

 Considering that we continue to operate in a concerning economic and challenging industry-related environment, we are very pleased with our current performance and future prospects. Even with the present threats with which our overall industry is exposed, we are very optimistic about the future growth and earnings potential for United Bancorp, Inc. (UBCP).

We have and continue to invest in areas that will lead to our continued and future relevancy within our industry. Although such initiatives can stress the short-term performance of our Company, we firmly believe that they will help us fulfil our intermediate and longer-term goals and produce above industry average earnings and overall performance. As previously mentioned, we still have a vision of growing UBCP to an asset threshold of 1.0 billion or greater in the near term in a prudent and profitable fashion. We are truly excited about our Company s direction and the potential that it brings.

 Analysis of Financial Condition Earning Assets Loans The Company s focus as a community bank is to meet the credit needs of the markets it serves. At September 30, 2024, gross loans were 475.0 million, compared to 483.2 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 8.2 million after offsetting repayments for the period. The overall decrease in the loan portfolio was comprised of a 9.0 million decrease in commercial and commercial real estate loans and a 2.1 million decrease in residential real estate lending and a 2.8 million increase in installment loans since December 31, 2023. Commercial and commercial real estate loans comprised 78.8 of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 79.3 at December 31, 2023. Commercial and commercial real estate loans have decreased 8.2 million, or 1.7 since December 31, 2023. This segment of the loan portfolio includes originated loans in its market areas and purchased participations in loans from other banks for out-of-area commercial and commercial real estate loans to benefit from consistent economic growth outside the Company s primary market area. Installment loans represented 2.0 of total loans at September 30, 2024 and 1.4 at December 31, 2023. Some of the installment loans carry somewhat more risk than real estate lending; however, it also provides for higher yields. Installment loans have increased 2.8 million since December 31, 2023. Residential real estate loans were 19.2 of total loans at September 30, 2024 and 19.3 at December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 2.0 million or 2.2 since December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company did not hold any loans for sale. As of September 30, 2024, the Company considered its concentration of credit risk to be acceptable. The highest concentrations are in 1 st Lien 1-4 Family with 117.5 million of loans outstanding, or 24.8 of total loan outstanding at September 30, 2024, and Owner Occupied Non Farm/Non Residential with loans outstanding of 97.6 million of 20.6 of loans outstanding. The following table presents additional detail regarding the Company s largest loan concentration as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Account Type Outstanding Percent Outstanding Percent (Dollars, in thousands) 1 st Lien 1-4 Family 117,486 24.8 120,903 25.0 Owner Occupied Non Farm/Non Residential 97,642 20.6 101,542 21.0 Commercial Industrial 96,508 20.4 91,294 18.9 Other Non Farm/Non Residential 88,998 19.0 94,894 19.6 The allowance for credit losses totaled 4.0 million at September 30, 2024, which represented 0.84 of total loans. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2023, or was 3.9 million or 0.81 of total loans. The allowance represents the amount which management and the Board of Directors estimates is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance balance and the provision charged to expense are reviewed by management and the Board of Directors monthly using a risk evaluation model that considers borrowers past due experience, economic conditions and various other circumstances that are subject to change over time. Management believes the current balance of the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb estimated credit losses associated with the loan portfolio. Net loan charge-offs (exclusive of overdrafts net charge-offs of 80,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 141,000. Net loans charged off (exclusive of overdrafts net charge-offs 82,000) was 22,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Sources of Funds Deposits The Company s primary source of funds is core deposits from retail and business customers. These core deposits include all categories of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits, and certificates of deposits. For the period ended September 30, 2024, total deposits decreased approximately 5.6 million, or less than 1.0 from December 31, 2023 totals. In addition to the decrease in deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has also experienced a shift of deposits from interest bearing and savings to certificate of deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company has a strong deposit base from public agencies, including local school districts, city and township municipalities, public works facilities and others that may tend to be more seasonal in nature resulting from the receipt and disbursement of state and federal grants. These entities have maintained fairly static balances with the Company due to various funding and disbursement timeframes. Sources of Funds Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings Other interest-bearing liabilities include securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances. The majority of the Company s repurchase agreements are with local school districts and city and county governments. The Company s repurchase agreements increased approximately 9.3 million from December 31, 2023 totals. At September 30, 2024, the Company has 75 million of fixed rate advances that mature over the next 2 to 4 years. Refer to footnote 10 for further information. Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net Income For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company reported net earnings of 5,553,000, compared to 6,560,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On a per share basis, the Company s diluted earnings were 0.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.15 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net Interest Income Net interest income, by definition, is the difference between interest income generated on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Various factors contribute to changes in net interest income, including volumes, interest rates and the composition or mix of interest-earning assets in relation to interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income before the provision for credit losses decreased 4.5 , or 878,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the overall fuding costs for the Company. Provision for (Reversal of Credit Loss Expense Loans and Off Balance Sheet Commitments Net loans charged-off for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding overdrafts, was 141,000. Considering the level of charge-offs and a slight increase in the projection of unemployment in our loan credit loss reserve modeling system, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 304,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a reversal of credit loss expense off balance sheet commitments of 130,000 due to reduction in outstanding commitments. Giving strong consideration to our overall solid credit related metrics at September 30, 2023, our Company had a reversal of credit loss expense of 300,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall improvement in the economy post COVID also contributed to the reversal of credit loss expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest Income Total noninterest income is made up of bank related fees and service charges, as well as other income producing services provided, sales of loans in the secondary market, ATM income, early redemption penalties for certificates of deposit, safe deposit rental income, internet bank service fees, earnings on bank-owned life insurance and other miscellaneous items.

 Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 increased 240,000 or 7.9 . The net realized gain on sale of loans increased 355,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was offset by a net realized loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities of 116,000 for the same period. Noninterest Expense The Company saw its noninterest expense increase by 275,000 or 1.7 year-over-year. Our Company was able to successfully apply and be approved for an Employee Retention Credit (ERC) in the first quarter which helped to offset the general increase due to inflation during 2024. Federal Income Taxes The (credit) provision for federal income taxes was 41,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 339,000 for the same period in 2023. The credit for federal income taxes is a result of the increased level of non taxable income year period over period. Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net Income For the three months ended September 30, 2024 the Company reported net earnings of 1,820,000, compared to 2,392,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Net Interest Income Net interest income decreased 6.5 , or 427,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was mainly driven by an increase in the Company s cost of funds for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Provision for (Reversal of Credit Loss Expense Loans and Off Balance Sheet Commitments Net loans charged-off for the three months ended September 30, 2024, excluding overdrafts, was 141,000. Considering the level of charge-offs and a slight increase in the projection of unemployment in our loan loss reserve modeling system, the Company recorded a provision for credit loss expense - loans of 69,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Giving strong consideration to our overall solid credit related metrics as of September 30, 2023 and the forecast for unemployment improving, our Company had a reversal of credit loss expense of 154,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest Income Total noninterest income is made up of bank related fees and service charges, as well as other income producing services provided, sales of loans in the secondary market, ATM income, early redemption penalties for certificates of deposit, safe deposit rental income, internet bank service fees, earnings on bank-owned life insurance and other miscellaneous items. Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 increased 253,000 or 26.2 .

Noninterest Expense The Company saw its noninterest expense increase by 296,000 or 5.7 year-over-year. Salaries increased 277,000 for the three months ended compared to the same period in 2023.

 Federal Income Taxes The (credit) provision for federal income taxes was 64,000) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 58,000 for the same period in 2023. The credit for federal income taxes is a result of the increased level of non taxable income period year period. Capital Resources Internal capital growth, through the retention of earnings, is the primary means of maintaining capital adequacy for the Company. Stockholders equity totaled 65.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 63.6 million at December 31, 2023, a 1.9 million increase. Total stockholders equity in relation to total assets was 7.94 at September 30, 2024 and 7.76 at December 31, 2023. The Company s Articles of Incorporation allows for a class of preferred shares with 2,000,000 authorized shares. This enables the Company, at the option of the Board of Directors, to issue series of preferred shares in a manner calculated to take advantage of financing techniques which may provide a lower effective cost of capital to the Company. The amendment also provides greater flexibility to the Board of Directors in structuring the terms of equity securities that may be issued by the Company. Although this preferred stock is a financial tool, it has not been utilized to date. The Company has offered for many years a Dividend Reinvestment Plan The Plan for shareholders under which the Company s common stock will be purchased by the Plan for participants with automatically reinvested dividends. The Plan does not represent a change in the Company s dividend policy or a guarantee of future dividends. The Company is subject to the regulatory requirements of The Federal Reserve System as a bank holding company. The Bank is subject to regulations of the FDIC and the State of Ohio, Division of Financial Institutions. The most important of these various regulations address capital adequacy. On January 1, 2015, the final rules of the Federal Reserve Board went into effect implementing in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Under the final rule, minimum requirements increased for both the quality and quantity of capital held by banking organizations. The rule requires a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent and a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4 percent to 6 percent and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent for all banking organizations. The Bank continues to be well-capitalized in accordance with Federal regulatory capital requirements as the capital ratios below show: 

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 13.37 Tier 1 capital ratio 13.37 Total capital ratio 14.07 Leverage ratio 9.53

 Liquidity Management s objective in managing liquidity is maintaining the ability to continue meeting the cash flow needs of its customers, such as borrowings or deposit withdrawals, as well as its own financial commitments. The principal sources of liquidity are net income, loan payments, maturing securities and sales of securities available for sale, federal funds sold and cash and deposits with banks. Along with its liquid assets, the Company has additional sources of liquidity available to ensure that adequate funds are available as needed. These include, but are not limited to, the purchase of federal funds, the ability to borrow funds under line of credit agreements with correspondent banks, a borrowing agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the adjustment of interest rates to obtain depositors. Management feels that it has the capital adequacy and profitability to meet the current and projected liquidity needs of its customers. Inflation While the stock market has continued to remain robust through the third quarter of 2024, certain indicators suggest that there could be looming trouble in the national and global economies related to increased fiscal deficits and the need for additional borrowing by the U.S. government to fund both its operations and to service its existing debt. In addition, data supplied by the Federal Reserve continues to show a systematic decline in consumer confidence in the U.S. since the beginning of 2024. Some of the basis for the current consumer sentiment is related to pressure on home values, primarily in the sunbelt states, as well as increasing concern over job security. While personal consumption has remained relatively strong on a national basis through August of 2024, many economists warn that a significant reduction in consumer spending may become a factor going into fiscal year 2025. With respect specifically to the third quarter of 2024, the Federal Reserve has indicated that economic activity was little changed in nearly all Federal Reserve Districts. Most Districts reported declining manufacturing activity, with activity in the banking sector remaining generally steady to up slightly, and loan demand was mixed, with some Districts noting an improvement in the outlook due to the decline in interest rates. Reports on consumer spending were mixed. While housing market activity has generally held up, with home values largely holding steady, inventory continued to expand in much of the nation. Nationally, commercial real estate markets were generally flat. According to the Federal Reserve, inflation has continued to moderate during the third quarter of 2024. However, the prices of some food staples, such as eggs and dairy, have increased more sharply in some regions, and acute pressures from rising insurance and healthcare costs are being felt by some consumers. The principal mechanism used by the Federal Reserve to combat rising inflation involves increasing interest rates, and it is management s opinion is that movements in interest rates affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations more acutely in the short term than changes in the rate of inflation. The Company s ability to match the interest sensitivity of its financial assets to the interest sensitivity of its liabilities in its asset/liability management may tend to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on the Company s performance. Inflation, however, can directly impact the Company s performance by potentially reducing the spending power of its borrowers. Higher costs continue to present a risk to the economy. Interest rate levels and energy prices, in combination with global economic conditions and fiscal and monetary policy, will likely continue to impact our results for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. The Company continues to closely monitor and analyze the higher risk segments within the loan portfolio, tracking past due accounts. Based on the Company s capital levels, prudent underwriting policies, loan concentration diversification and our geographic footprint, senior management is cautiously optimistic that the Company is positioned to continue managing the impact of the varied set of risks and uncertainties currently impacting the economy and remain adequately capitalized. However, the Company may be required to make additional credit loss provisions as warranted by the extremely fluid economic condition.
