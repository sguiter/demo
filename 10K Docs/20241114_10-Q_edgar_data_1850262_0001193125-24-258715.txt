 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 . The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a Business Combination. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues. All activity for the period from February 16, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to (i) the Company s formation and the IPO described below, and (ii) since the closing of the IPO the search for a prospective and consummation of an initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating
 income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the IPO. 
 Sponsor and Financing 

The Sponsor, Integral Sponsor, LLC, is a Delaware limited liability company. 
 The IPO Registration Statement was declared effective on November 2, 2021. On November 5, 2021, the Company, consummated its IPO of Units, including Units issued upon exercise in full by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional Units. Each Unit consists of one Public Share, and one-half
 of one Public Warrant, with each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for per share. The Units were sold at a price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the Private Placement of an aggregate of Private Placement Warrants, including Private Placement Warrants issued in connection with the exercise in full by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional Units, to the Sponsor at a purchase price of per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 Upon the closing of the IPO and the Private Placement, was placed in the Trust Account, representing the redemption value of the Public Shares sold in the IPO, at their redemption value of per share. 
 The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. 
 Founder Shares 

The Initial Stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares and any Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination and (ii) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction after the Business Combination that results in all of the stockholders having the right to exchange their Class A Common Stock for cash, securities or other property; except to certain permitted transferees and under certain circumstances (the Lock-up ).
 Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the Initial Stockholders with respect to any Founder Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Founder Shares will be released from the Lock-up
 if the closing price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within any -trading
 day period commencing at least days after the initial Business Combination. On December 29, 2021, the Sponsor transferred Founder Shares to an Anchor Investor. 

Trust Account 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, funds in the Trust Account were invested in an interest bearing demand deposit account. Except for the withdrawal of funds to pay taxes, funds will remain in the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the consummation of its first Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. The remaining proceeds outside the Trust Account may be used for (i) business, legal and accounting expenses, (ii) due diligence on prospective acquisitions and (iii) continuing general and administrative expenses. 
 Initial Business Combination 

The Company will provide its Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination at a per-share
 price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable (excluding Excise Taxes)), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. As of September 30, 2024, the amount in the Trust Account was (before taxes paid or payable) per Public Share. 
 The shares of Common Stock subject to redemption have been recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO, in accordance with ASC 480. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 
 Following the IPO, the Company initially had only 18 months from the closing of the IPO to complete the initial Business Combination, which period, as further discussed below, was extended to November 5, 2025. If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share
 price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable (excluding Excise Taxes) and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 The Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares they hold in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares they hold in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Amended and Restated Charter, (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, and (iv) vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of the initial Business Combination. 

The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 Proposed Business Combination 

On October 19, 2023, the Company entered into the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement, with Flybondi, FB Parent, Merger Sub and the Signing Sellers.

 For a full description of the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement and the proposed Flybondi Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business of the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Extensions of the Combination Period 

On May 3, 2023, the Company held the First Special Meeting.

 Founder Share Conversion 

Following the approval of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal at the Second Special Meeting, on November 3, 2023, the Company issued an aggregate of shares of Class A Common Stock (consisting of shares to the Sponsor and shares to an Anchor Investor) upon the conversion of an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock, held by the Sponsor and such Anchor Investor, respectively. The shares of Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the Founder Share Conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B Common Stock before the Founder Share Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of a Business Combination, as described in the IPO Registration Statement. Following the Founder Share Conversion, the First Special Meeting Redemptions and the Second Special Meeting Redemptions, there were shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and one share of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. As a result, the Sponsor holds approximately of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock. 
 Transfer of Trust Account Funds

 Risks and Uncertainties 

The continuing military conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, the military conflict in the Middle East and the risk of escalations of other military conflicts have created and are expected to create global economic consequences. The specific impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is not determinable as of the date of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. 

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 

On August 16, 2022, the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal Excise Tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the Excise Tax. The Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the Excise Tax. In April 2024, the Treasury issued proposed regulations providing guidance with respect to the Excise Tax. Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Under the proposed regulations, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year as a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. 
 Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the Excise Tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the Excise Tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination, but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the Excise Tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the Excise Tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. 
 During the second quarter, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the Excise Tax. These regulations provided that the filing and payment deadline for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 would be October 31, 2024. 
 On October 23, 2024, the Company filed its excise tax return and paid using acquired from the Cartesian Escrow Parties in association with the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement. 
 Termination of Forward Purchase Agreement 

On August 23, 2021, pursuant to the FPAs, Crescent Park, which is one of the Anchor Investors, and Carnegie Park agreed to purchase up to Forward Purchase Shares in the case of Crescent Park and up to Forward Purchase Shares in the case of Carnegie Park at per share (as such price per share may be reduced to per share or further reduced to below per share with respect to all or part of the Forward Purchase Shares) for gross proceeds up to in the aggregate if all of the Forward Purchase Shares were purchased at per share (or up to in the aggregate if all of the Forward Purchase Shares were purchased at per share, or up to a lower amount in the aggregate if all of the Forward Purchase Shares were purchased at less than per share) in private placements that would occur concurrently with the consummation of the initial Business Combination. 

On December 8, 2023 and December 12, 2023, the Company and each of Carnegie Park and Crescent Park entered into the FPA Termination Agreements to mutually terminate and cancel the FPAs. At the IPO, the Company recognized an offering cost of within the statement of stockholders equity. Upon the termination of the FPAs, the Company recognized an aggregate gain of with recognized as a reversal of the offering costs and the remaining recognized as an unrealized gain on the change in fair value of FPA on the accompanying unaudited condensed statements of operations. 
 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard 

On June 28, 2023, the Company received the First Nasdaq Notice from the Nasdaq Staff notifying the Company that for the prior consecutive business days, its MVLS was below the minimum of million required for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to the Market Value Standard. This notification had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s securities on Nasdaq. 
 In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company had a period of 180 calendar days, or until December 26, 2023, to regain compliance with the Market Value Standard. The First Nasdaq Notice stated that to regain compliance, the Company s MVLS must close at million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the Nasdaq Compliance Period, at which time Nasdaq would provide written notification the Company had achieved compliance under the Market Value Standard and the matter would be closed. 
 On October 24, 2023, the Company received the Second Nasdaq Notice from the Nasdaq Staff indicating that it was not in compliance with the Minimum Total Holders Rule, which requires the Company to maintain at least 400 total holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market. The Notice was only a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s securities on the Nasdaq Global Market. 
 In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810I(2)(A)(i), the Second Nasdaq Notice stated that the Company had 45 calendar days, or until December 8, 2023, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Total Holders Rule. 
 On December 7, 2023, the Company applied to transfer its securities from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. On December 18, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Staff approving its application to list is securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company s securities were transferred to the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on December 21, 2023. The First Nasdaq Notice and Second Nasdaq Notice are deemed to be resolved as a result of this transfer to the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 On November 4, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2

 Rule IM-5101-2 ),

 the staff of Nasdaq Staff had determined that (i) the Company s securities will be delisted from Nasdaq, (ii) trading of the Company s Class A common stock, warrants, and units will be suspended at the opening of business on November 11, 2024 and (iii) a Form 25-NSE
 will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), which will remove the Company s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. Under Rule IM-5101-2,

 a special purpose acquisition company must complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement. Since the Company failed to complete its initial business combination by November 2, 2024, the Staff concluded that the Company did not comply with Rule IM-5101-2

 and that the Company s securities are now subject to delisting. 
 Trading of the Company s securities on the OTC market commenced on November 11, 2024. The delisting from Nasdaq and the commencement of trading on the OTC market does not affect the Company s previously announced Business Combination with Flybondi, as both parties continue to work to effectuate the completion of that Business Combination. The combined company, which will be Flybondi Holdings plc, has applied for listing of its securities on the Nasdaq Stock Market in connection with the completion of the Business Combination. 
 The Company will remain a reporting entity under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to continued disclosure of financial and operational information. 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, we had in our operating bank account (including in a segregated account for the payment of Excise Taxes), and a working capital deficit of (including in cash received from the Cartesian Escrow Parties for the payment of Excise Taxes). 
 Prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company s liquidity needs had been satisfied through (i) a loan under the IPO Promissory Note, an unsecured promissory note with the Sponsor totaling and (ii) the issuance of Class B Common Stock at approximately per share for gross proceeds of . The IPO Promissory Note has been repaid and no other borrowings are permitted. Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, the Company s liquidity needs have been satisfied through the issuance of the Private Placement Warrants, which generated gross proceeds of . 
 On May 8, 2023, the Company issued the First Extension Promissory Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to to be deposited into the Trust Account (see Note 3). As of September 30, 2024, had been borrowed under the First Extension Promissory Note. 

On November 8, 2023, the Company issued the Second Extension Promissory Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to to be deposited into the Trust Account (see Note 3).

 On July 10, 2023, the Company issued the June 2023 Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to (see Note 3). As of September 30, 2024, had been borrowed under the June 2023 Note. 
 On September 12, 2024, the Company issued the September 2024 Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to to the Sponsor. The September 2024 Note was issued in connection with advances the Sponsor has made, and may make in the future, to the Company for working capital and transaction expenses. The September 2024 Note bears interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective. As of September 30, 2024, had been borrowed under the September 2024 Note. 
 Included on the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheet at September 30, 2024 is of cash released to the Company on April 30, 2024 by the Cartesian Escrow Parties for the payment of the Company s Excise Tax liability. Such amount was released to the Company solely for the purpose of the Company paying the Excise Tax liability and (i) under conditions as stipulated in the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement and (ii) is being held by the Company in a segregated bank account. 
 In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASU 2014-15,
 Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution, should the Company be unable to complete a Business Combination, and insufficient cash raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. At the Third Special Meeting, the stockholders extended the Combination Period from November 5, 2024 to November 5, 2025; however, it is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period. If a Business Combination is not consummated within the Combination Period, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after the Combination Period 

Level 2 Valuations based on (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities, or (iv) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market through correlation or other means. 

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 Forward Purchase Shares issued pursuant to the FPAs in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40
 (see Note 4). Such guidance provides that because the FPAs do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each FPA must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classifies each FPA at its fair value. This FPA is subject tore-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement,
 the FPA would be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the accompanying unaudited condensed statement of operations. 
 On December 8, 2023 and December 12, 2023, the Company and each of Carnegie Park and Crescent Park entered into the FPA Termination Agreements to mutually terminate and cancel the FPAs. With the termination of the FPAs, the FPA fair value was adjusted to . At the IPO, the Company recognized an offering cost of within the statement of stockholders equity. Upon the termination of the FPAs, the Company recognized an aggregate gain of with recognized as a reversal of the offering costs and the remaining recognized as an unrealized gain on the change in fair value of the FPAs on the accompanying unaudited condensed statements of operations. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s deferred tax asset had a full valuation allowance recorded against it. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to New York State and City taxes, Business Combination related expenses and the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to changes in fair value of the FPAs and the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets. The Company s effective tax rate was ) and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, ) and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
 to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. 
 The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. 
 
 The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50
 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company is in the process of amending the 2023 corporate income tax return. The Company s operations included those activities necessary to consummate a Business Combination. As such, the Company deducted startup and operating costs for tax return purposes. As a result, the Company recognized a reserve for uncertain tax positions on the balance sheet. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company reported and on the balance sheet for this uncertainty. 

The Company is subject to income taxation by major taxing authorities since its inception. The Company files US federal and New York City and State tax returns and is subject to examination by various taxing authorities. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. Management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next 12 months.

 Class A and Class B Common Stock is calculated by dividing net (loss) income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares of redeemable Class A Common Stock and non-redeemable
 Class A and Class B Common Stock outstanding, allocated proportionally to each class of Common Stock.

When used in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our Management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our Management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our Management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on February 16, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a Business Combination. Our Sponsor, Integral Sponsor, LLC, is a Delaware limited liability company. The IPO Registration Statement was declared effective on November 2, 2021. On November 5, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units, including the full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option to purchase 1,500,000 Units, at a purchase price of 10.00 per Unit. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 4,950,000 Private Placement Warrants (including 90,000 Private Placement Warrants issued in connection with the exercise in full by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional Units) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to us of 4,950,000. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, Management agreed that an amount equal to at least 10.15 per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, including the proceeds of the Private Placement, would be held in the Trust Account with Continental acting as trustee, and would be initially invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct Treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to us to pay taxes, if any, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of the Public Shares if we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of the Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Amended and Restated Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of the Public Shares if we have not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our Public Stockholders. If we are unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable (excluding Excise Taxes) and up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable laws.

On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted the 2024 SPAC Rules, which became effective on July 1, 2024, which will affect SPAC Business Combination transactions. The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions; (ii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; (iii) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions; and (iv) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business Combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. Recent Developments Excise taxes On October 23, 2024, we filed our excise tax return and paid 1,076,073 using 900,000 acquired from the Cartesian Escrow Parties as contemplated by the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement. Securities Listing On November 4, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2 Rule IM-5101-2 ), the staff of Nasdaq Staff had determined that (i) the Company s securities will be delisted from Nasdaq, (ii) trading of the Company s Class A common stock, warrants, and units will be suspended at the opening of business on November 11, 2024 and (iii) a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), which will remove the Company s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. Under Rule IM-5101-2, a special purpose acquisition company must complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement. Since the Company failed to complete its initial business combination by November 2, 2024, the Staff concluded that the Company did not comply with Rule IM-5101-2 and that the Company s securities are now subject to delisting. Trading of the Company s securities on the OTC market commenced on November 11, 2024. The delisting from Nasdaq and the commencement of trading on the OTC market does not affect the Company s previously announced Business Combination with Flybondi, as both parties continue to work to effectuate the completion of that Business Combination. The combined company, which will be Flybondi Holdings plc, has applied for listing of its securities on the Nasdaq Stock Market in connection with the completion of the Business Combination. The Company will remain a reporting entity under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to continued disclosure of financial and operational information.

The First Extension Promissory Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination or our liquidation. Additionally, we agreed to make monthly deposits of 105,000 into the Trust Account for each calendar month (commencing on May 8, 2023) or portion thereof, that was needed by us to complete an initial Business Combination until November 3, 2023, and such amount will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon our liquidation or (ii) Public Stockholders who elect to have their Pubic Shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination.

Pursuant to the Novation Agreement, the Assignor assigned to the Assignee all of its liabilities, agreements, obligations, rights and duties in, under, and arising from the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement (the Substitution ). Also on July 2, 2024, the Company, Sponsor, and Flybondi entered into the Flybondi Sponsor Support Agreement Amendment to reflect the Substitution. On October 1, 2024, the parties to the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement entered into the Second Amendment to Business Combination Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to extend the Agreement End Date (as defined in the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement) from November 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025. Other than the extension of the Agreement End Date, the terms of the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement remain unchanged. For a full description of the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement and the proposed Flybondi Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business of the 2023 Annual Report. Uncertain Tax Position We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company is in the process of amending the 2023 corporate income tax return. The Company s operations included those activities necessary to consummate a Business Combination. As such, the Company deducted startup and operating costs for tax return purposes. As a result, the Company recognized a reserve for uncertain tax positions on the balance sheet. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company reported 371,214 and 0 on the balance sheet for this uncertainty.

Results of Operations As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from February 16, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 relates to our formation and the Initial Public Offering and, since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective and consummation of an initial Business Combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and held in our Trust Account. We incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 268,093, which consisted of operating costs of 397,659 and provision for income tax of 44,219, partially offset by interest income from the Trust Account of 173,785. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 922,545, which consisted of operating costs of 1,306,230 and provision for income tax of 131,362, partially offset by interest income from the Trust Account of 515,047. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 688,152, which consisted of trust interest income of 412,108, an unrealized gain on the change in the fair value of the FPA liability of 818,251 and unrealized gain on the Trust Account of 6,972, offset by operating costs of 520,762 and provision from income tax of 28,417. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 593,361, which consisted of trust interest income of 2,329,140 and unrealized gain on the Trust Account of 139,355, offset by operating costs of 1,393,021, an unrealized loss on the change in the fair value of the FPA liability of 44,330 and provision from income tax of 437,783. Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern As of September 30, 2024, we had 927,414 in our operating bank account, (including 900,000 in a segregated account for the payment of Excise Taxes), and a working capital deficit of 3,929,352 (including 900,000 in cash received from Cartesian Escrow Parties for the payment of excise taxes). Prior to the completion of the Initial Public Offering, our liquidity needs had been satisfied through (i) a loan under the IPO Promissory Note issued to the Sponsor totaling 252,950 and (ii) the issuance of 2,875,000 Class B Common Stock at approximately 0.009 per share for gross proceeds of 25,000. The IPO Promissory Note has been repaid and no other borrowings are permitted. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our liquidity needs have been satisfied through the issuance of the Private Placement Warrants, which generated gross proceeds of 4,950,000 and the June 2023 Note. On May 8, 2023, we issued the First Extension Promissory Note to the Sponsor in an amount of up to 630,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account 105,000 per month following the 5th of each month through November 3, 2023) for the benefit of the Public Stockholders who did not redeem their Public Shares in connection with the First Extension. The First Extension Promissory Note bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate Business Combination and (ii) the date of our liquidation. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 355,000 of borrowings under the First Extension Promissory Note. 
 25 

Table of Contents 

On November 8, 2023, we issued the Second Extension Promissory Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 359,503 to the Sponsor. The Second Extension Promissory Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate a Business Combination and (ii) the date of our liquidation. Additionally, we will continue to deposit 29,959 into the Trust Account for each calendar month (commencing on November 8, 2023 and ending on the 5th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by us to complete an initial Business Combination until November 5, 2024, and such amount will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon our liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their Public Shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of the initial Business Combination. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 329,540 and 59,917, respectively, of borrowings under the Second Extension Promissory Note. On September 12, 2024, we issued the September 2024 Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 3,000,000 to the Sponsor. The September 2024 Note was issued in connection with advances the Sponsor has made, and may make in the future, to the Company for working capital and transaction expenses. The September 2024 Note bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective. At September 30, 2024 the Company had 77,377 of borrowings under the September 2024 Note. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us Working Capital Loans as may be required on a non-interest basis. If we complete an initial Business Combination, we would repay such Working Capital Loans. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. On July 10, 2023, we issued the June 2023 Note to the Sponsor in an amount of up to 1,500,000 in connection with the Working Capital Loans - convertible. The June 2023 Note bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate a Business Combination and (ii) the date of our Company. Additionally, at the option of the Sponsor, the unpaid principle may be converted into warrants at a conversion price of 1.00 per warrant. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans - convertible, but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans - convertible. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owed 1,500,000 and 910,083, respectively, under the June 2023 Note and reported the amounts as Working Capital Loans - convertible on the condensed balance sheets in Item 1. Financial Statements . Included on the unaudited condensed balance sheet at September 30, 2024 in Item 1. Financial Statements is 900,000 of cash release to us by the Cartesian Escrow Parties for the payment of our Excise Tax liability. Such amount was released to us solely for the purpose paying our Excise Tax liability and (i) under conditions as stipulated in the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement and (ii) is being held by us in a segregated bank account. On October 23, 2024, the Company filed its excise tax return and paid 1,076,073 using 900,000 acquired from the Cartesian Escrow Parties in association with the Flybondi Business Combination Agreement. On October 31, 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASU 2014-15, Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution, should we be unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and insufficient cash, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Following the Third Special Meeting, we have until November 5, 2025 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after the end of the Combination Period.

Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities. Administrative Services Agreement On November 2, 2021, we agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of 20,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support pursuant to the Services Agreement. Upon completion of the Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. Total administrative fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is 60,000 and 180,000, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 100,000 and 80,000 is reported on the condensed balance sheets in Item 1. Financial Statements as due to the Sponsor for the administrative fees due, respectively. Registration Rights Agreement Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the holders of the (i) Founder Shares, (ii) Private Placement Warrants, and (iii) warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their underlying securities, as applicable) will have registration rights to require us to register a sale of any of our securities held by them prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial Business Combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Consulting and Advisory Services On May 28, 2021, we entered into a letter agreement with J.V.B., pursuant to which, we engaged Cohen Company to provide consulting and advisory services in connection with the Initial Public Offering in return for a transaction fee to be paid to J.V.B. in an amount equal to 10.0 of the aggregate underwriting discount and commissions earned by the underwriters in connection with the Initial Public Offering to be paid simultaneously with the actual payment of such underwriting discount and commissions to the underwriters upon (i) the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (ii) the completion of the initial Business Combination. J.V.B. was one of the Anchor Investors that purchased Units in the Initial Public Offering and became a member of the Sponsor at the closing of our Initial Public Offering and holds an indirect interest in a specified number of the Founder Shares held by the Sponsor. On November 4, 2021, we paid J.V.B. 85,000 in cash from funds outside of the Trust Account. Funds due to J.V.B. upon the completion of the initial Business Combination 605,000 in the aggregate) were to be paid by the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering. On November 9, 2023, our Company and J.V.B. mutually agreed to terminate this arrangement. No further transactions fees will be payable to J.V.B. under this engagement of services. Underwriter Agreement The underwriters of the Initial Public Offering were entitled to a deferred underwriting commission of 0.50 on the first 10,000,000 Units sold in the Initial Public Offering and 0.70 per Unit per Unit sold thereafter, or 6,050,000 in the aggregate. On August 28, 2023, the underwriters waived any right to receive the deferred underwriting commission and will therefore receive no additional underwriting commissions in connection with the Flybondi Business Combination. As a result, 6,050,000 was recorded to accumulated deficit in relation to the reduction of the deferred underwriter fee. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the deferred underwriting fee is 0. We comply with ASC 405 and derecognized the deferred underwriting commission liability upon being released of the obligation by the underwriters. To account for the waiver of the deferred underwriting commission, we reduced the deferred underwriter commission liability to 0 and reversed the previously recorded cost of issuing the instruments in the Initial Public Offering, which included a reduction in the accumulated deficit and increased income available to Class B Common Stock by 6,050,000, which was previously allocated to the Class A Common Stock subject to redemption and accretion recognized at the date of the Initial Public Offering.

Anchor Investment The Anchor Investors purchased an aggregate of approximately 60.8 million of the Units in the Initial Public Offering at the public offering price. There can be no assurance that the Anchor Investors will retain their Units prior to or upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination. In addition, none of the Anchor Investors has any obligation to vote any of their Public Shares in favor of the initial Business Combination. The Anchor Investors have not been granted any stockholder or other rights that are in addition to those granted to our other Public Stockholders, and were only issued equity interests in our Sponsor, with no right to control our Sponsor or vote or dispose of any securities held by our Sponsor. Further, unlike some anchor investor arrangements of other blank check companies, the Anchor Investors are not required to (i) hold any Units, Class A Common Stock or Public Warrants they may have purchased in the Initial Public Offering or thereafter for any amount of time, (ii) vote any shares of Class A Common Stock they may own at the applicable time in favor of our initial Business Combination or (iii) refrain from exercising their right to redeem their Public Shares at the time of our initial Business Combination. The Anchor Investors have the same rights to the funds held in the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold as the rights afforded to our other Public Stockholders. Forward Purchase Agreements On August 23, 2021, pursuant to the FPAs, Crescent Park, which is one of the Anchor Investors, and Carnegie Park agreed to purchase up to 2,500,000 Forward Purchase Shares in the case of Crescent Park, and up to 500,000 Forward Purchase Shares in the case of Carnegie Park at 10.00 per share (as such price per share may be reduced to 9.20 per share or further reduced to below 9.20 per share with respect to all or part of the Forward Purchase Shares) for gross proceeds up to 30,000,000 in the aggregate if all of the Forward Purchase Shares were purchased at 10.00 per share (or up to 27,600,000 in the aggregate if all of the Forward Purchase Shares were purchased at 9.20 per share or up to a lower amount in the aggregate if all of the Forward Purchase Shares were purchased at less than 9.20 per share) in private placements that would occur concurrently with the consummation of the initial Business Combination. On December 8, 2023 and December 12, 2023, we and each of Carnegie Park and Crescent Park entered into the FPA Termination Agreements to mutually terminate and cancel the FPAs. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We account for income taxes under ASC 740. ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from the existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery will not meet the more likely than not threshold, it establishes a valuation allowance. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, due to identified material weaknesses related to errors in fair value calculation of certain financial instruments, unrecorded liabilities, including New York State taxes and lack of control in connection with timely review of the difference between the 2023 tax provision and corporate income tax return that resulted a potential tax liability of 371,214 as of September 30, 2024. Management plans to enhance internal controls and procedures, including enhancing access to accounting literature, identification and consideration of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and implementing additional layers of reviews in the financial close process. In light of these material weaknesses, we have enhanced our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements including making greater use of third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. We believe our efforts will enhance our controls relating to accounting for complex financial transactions, but we can offer no assurance that our controls will not require additional review and modification in the future as industry accounting practice may evolve over time. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than as discussed above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. To the knowledge of our Management, there is no material litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As a smaller reporting company under Rule12b-2of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. For additional risks relating to our operations, other than as set forth below, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our (i) IPO Registration Statement, (ii) 2021 Annual Report, (ii) 2022 Annual Report, (iii) 2023 Annual Report, (iv) Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on May 16, 2022, August 15, 2022, November 14, 2022, May 15, 2023, November 21, 2023 and August 7, 2024, respectively and (iv) Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as filed with the SEC on August 6, 2024 Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial Business Combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. For risks related to Flybondi and the Flybondi Business Combination, please see the Flybondi Registration Statement once publicly filed. Nasdaq has delisted our securities from trading on Nasdaq, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. On November 4, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2, the staff of Nasdaq had determined that (i) the Company s securities will be delisted from Nasdaq, (ii) trading of the Company s Class A common stock, warrants, and units will be suspended at the opening of business on November 11, 2024 and (iii) a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. Under Rule IM-5101-2, a special purpose acquisition company must complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement. Since the Company failed to complete its initial business combination by November 2, 2024, the Staff concluded that the Company did not comply with Rule IM-5101-2 and that the Company s securities are now subject to delisting. Trading of the Company s securities on the OTC market commenced on November 11, 2024. The delisting from Nasdaq and the commencement of trading on the OTC market does not affect the Company s previously announced Business Combination with Flybondi, as both parties continue to work to effectuate the completion of that Business Combination. The combined company, which will be Flybondi Holdings plc, has applied for listing of its securities on the Nasdaq Stock Market in connection with the completion of the Business Combination. The delisting of our securities by Nasdaq could adversely affect the trading market for our securities, as price quotations may not be as readily obtainable, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities and the Company s ability to raise additional capital. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that trading in our securities will continue over the counter or otherwise. As a result of the delisting, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; 

a determination that our shares of common stock are penny stock , which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. Currently our securities are not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations. All quotes will reflect unsolicited customer orders and, as a result, we expect any trading to involve a higher risk of wider spreads, increased volatility, and price dislocations and a general illiquid trading environment. Proprietary broker-dealer quotations may not commence until an initial review by a broker-dealer under the SEC s Rule 15c2-11 which would enable brokers to publish competing quotes and provide continuous market making. No assurance can be provided that a liquid trading market will develop even if market makers begin proprietary quotations and thus we expect investors will experience difficulty in trading our securities. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because they have been delisted, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. This state level regulation introduces additional compliance requirements for brokers to consider making markets in our securities and will further negatively impact any trading liquidity in our securities. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None. Use of Proceeds For a description of the use of proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, see Part II, Item 5 of the 2021 Annual Report. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as described in the IPO Registration Statement. The specific investments in our Trust Account may change from time to time. On October 31, 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities.

 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

On October 31, 2023, the Company held the Third Special Meeting, which was adjourned from October 28, 2024, at which the Company s stockholders approved, among other things, the Third Extension Amendment Proposal, which extended the Combination Period from November 5, 2024 to November 5, 2025. 835,672 Public Shares that were redeemed in connection with the vote to approve the Third Extension Amendment Proposal, resulting in approximately 9.5 million (approximately 11.41 per share) being removed from the Trust Account to pay such redeeming Public Stockholders. Following the Third Special Meeting Redemptions, we have 362,670 Public Shares outstanding.
