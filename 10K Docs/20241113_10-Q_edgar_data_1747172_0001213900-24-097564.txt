Advisory Agreement on February 5, 2021, the Company entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with its Advisor. Pursuant
to the Investment Advisory Agreement with its Advisor, the Company will pay its Advisor a fee for investment advisory and management services
consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee. The Advisor may, from time-to-time, grant waivers on the
Company s obligations, including waivers of the base management fee and/or incentive fee, under the Investment Advisory Agreement.
The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party with 60 days written notice. On March 6, 2024, the Board approved
an additional one-year term of the Investment Advisory Agreement from March 16, 2024 to March 15, 2025. 

In addition, on March 6, 2024,
the Board approved an amended and restated investment advisory agreement (the Amended Investment Advisory Agreement and
a fee waiver agreement (the Fee Waiver Agreement between the Company and the Advisor, which became effective upon the completion
of the initial public offering of the Company s shares of common stock on May 24, 2024 (the IPO Date ). 

The Amended
Investment Advisory Agreement is materially the same as the Investment Advisory Agreement except, following the IPO Date, the base management
fee is calculated at an annual rate of and the incentive fee on income is subject to a twelve-quarter lookback quarterly
hurdle rate of as opposed to a single quarter measurement and is subject to an Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below) based on the
Company s Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below). This lookback feature provides that the Advisor s
income incentive fee may be reduced if the Company s portfolio experiences aggregate write-downs or net capital losses during
the applicable Trailing Twelve Quarters (as defined below). Pursuant to the Fee Waiver Agreement, commencing on the IPO Date, the Advisor
implemented waivers of (i) the income incentive fee for three calendar quarters commencing the quarter the initial public offering
was completed and (ii) a portion of the base management fee for one year following the completion of the initial public offering.
Amounts waived by the Advisor pursuant to the Fee Waiver Agreement are not subject to recoupment by the Advisor. 

Base Management Fee 

Prior to the IPO Date, the base management fee
was calculated at an annual rate of of the fair market value of the Company s investments including, in each case, assets
purchased with borrowings under credit facilities and issuances of senior unsecured notes, but excluding cash, U.S. government securities
and commercial paper instruments maturing within one year of purchase. 

Commencing on the IPO Date, the base management
fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the fair market value of the Company s investments. Since the IPO Date was on a
date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the management fee was calculated for the calendar quarter at a weighted rate
based on the fee rates applicable before and after the IPO Date based on the number of days
in such calendar quarter before and after the IPO Date. Pursuant to the Fee Waiver Agreement, commencing on the IPO Date, the Advisor
has contractually agreed to waive the base management fee at an annual rate of for one year following the IPO Date. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred
base management fees of , net of waiver of . For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred base management
fees of .

Incentive Fee 

The Company also pays the Advisor an incentive fee. The incentive fee
consists of two parts an incentive fee on income and an incentive fee on capital gains. Described in more detail below, these components
of the incentive fee are largely independent of each other with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not.

of the Company s net asset value NAV at the end of the immediately
preceding calendar quarter annualized but not compounded) (the Hurdle Amount in order for the Company to receive
an income incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income excludes any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or
unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 

Commencing on the IPO Date, the Company will pay
the Advisor an income incentive fee based on its aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to (i) the quarter
ended June 30, 2024 (the First Calendar Quarter and (ii) each subsequent calendar quarter, with the then-current calendar
quarter and the eleven preceding calendar quarters beginning with the calendar quarter after the First Calendar Quarter (or the appropriate
portion thereof in the case of any of the Company s first eleven calendar quarters that commence after the First Calendar Quarter)
(those calendar quarters after the First Calendar Quarter, the Trailing Twelve Quarters ). 

For the First Calendar Quarter, pre-incentive fee
net investment income in respect of the First Calendar Quarter will be compared to a hurdle rate of annualized). The income
incentive fee for the First Calendar Quarter will be determined as follows: 

no income incentive fee is payable to the Advisor if the aggregate
pre-incentive fee net investment income for the First Calendar Quarter does not exceed that hurdle rate; 

of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment
income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds that hurdle rate, but
is less than a quarterly rate of for the portion of the First Calendar Quarter before the initial public offering and a quarterly
rate of for the portion of the First Calendar Quarter after the initial public offering, referred to the catch-up. 
The catch-up is meant to provide the Advisor with approximately of the Company s pre-incentive fee net
investment income for the portion of the First Calendar Quarter before the initial public offering and for the balance of that
First Calendar Quarter, as if the hurdle rate did not apply; and 

of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment
income, if any, that exceeds a quarterly rate of for the portion of the First Calendar Quarter before the initial public offering
and of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds a quarterly rate of for the balance
of the First Calendar Quarter. 

Commencing with the calendar
quarter beginning immediately after the First Calendar Quarter, subject to the Incentive Fee Cap (described below), the pre-incentive fee
net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters will be compared to a Hurdle Rate equal to the
product of (i) the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) and (ii) the sum of our net assets at the beginning of
each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Hurdle Rate will be calculated after making appropriate
adjustments to the Company s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for all issuances by the Company
of shares of its common stock, including issuances pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan, and distributions during the applicable
calendar quarter. The income incentive fee for each calendar quarter will be determined as follows: 

no income incentive fee is payable to the Advisor in any calendar
quarter in which aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters does not
exceed the Hurdle Rate;

of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment
income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income,
if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate, but is less than or equal to an amount, which we refer to as the Catch-up Amount, 
determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying by the Company s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar
quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters (after making appropriate adjustments to the Company s net asset value
at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for all issuances by the Company of shares of its common stock, including issuances
pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan, and distributions during the applicable calendar quarter); and 

of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment
income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters that exceeds the Catch-up Amount. 

Commencing with the quarter
that begins immediately after the First Calendar Quarter, each income incentive fee will be subject to an Incentive Fee Cap 
that in respect of any calendar quarter is an amount equal to of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below)
during the Trailing Twelve Quarters less the aggregate income incentive fees that were paid to the Advisor in the preceding eleven calendar
quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. In the event the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative
value then no income incentive fee shall be payable and if the Incentive Fee Cap is less than the amount of income incentive fee that
would otherwise be payable, the amount of income incentive fee shall be reduced to an amount equal to the Incentive Fee Cap. 

Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee
Net Return means (x) with respect to the First Calendar Quarter, the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income in
respect of the First Calendar Quarter, (y) with respect to the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters, the pre-incentive fee net
investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus any Net Capital Loss (as defined below), if any, in respect
of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company will pay
no income incentive fee to the Advisor for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value
but is less than the income incentive fee that is payable to the Advisor for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap)
calculated as described above, the Company will pay an income incentive fee to the Advisor equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter.
If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the income incentive fee that is payable to the
Advisor for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company will pay an income
incentive fee to the Advisor equal to the incentive fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive
Fee Cap. 

Net Capital Loss 
in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized,
in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. 

These calculations are
prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter.
Amounts waived by the Advisor pursuant to the Fee Waiver Agreement are not subject to recoupment by the Advisor.

of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from formation through (a) the day before our initial
public offering IPO ), (b) upon consummation of a Liquidity Event (as defined in the Investment Advisory Agreement)
or (c) upon the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital
depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the purpose of computing the capital gain incentive fee, the calculation methodology looked through
derivative financial instruments or swaps as if the Company owned the reference assets directly. 

Commencing on the IPO
Date, the incentive fee on capital gains is calculated and payable in arrears in cash as of
the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from formation through the end of a given calendar year or upon
termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a
cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. Following the Company s IPO, solely
for the purposes of calculating the capital gain incentive fee, the Company is deemed to have previously paid capital gains incentive
fees prior to its IPO equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid capital gain
incentive fees for all periods prior to its IPO by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) by (y) . In the event
that the Investment Advisory Agreement terminates as of a date that is not a fiscal year end, the termination date will be treated as
though it were a fiscal year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gain incentive fee. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred
incentive fees on income of , net of waivers of and no incentive fees on capital gains. For the three months ended September
30, 2023, the Company incurred incentive fees on income of and no incentive fees on capital gains. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred
incentive fees on income of , net of waivers of , and no incentive fees on capital gains. For the nine months ended September
30, 2023, the Company incurred incentive fees on income of and no incentive fees on capital gains. 

Payment of Incentive Fees Prior to the IPO Date 

Prior to the Company s IPO, incentive fees
earned by the Advisor accrued as earned but only became payable in cash to the Advisor upon consummation the IPO. In June 2024, the Company
paid to the Advisor for these accrued as earned fees through the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Share Repurchase Plan 

On May 21, 2024, the Company entered into a share repurchase plan, or the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to in the aggregate
of the Company s Common Stock at prices below the Company s net asset value per share over a specified period, in accordance
with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company 10b5-1 Plan
was approved by the Board of Directors on March 6, 2024. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Morgan Stanley Corporation as the Company s
agent, to repurchase Common Stock on its behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per
share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by the Company to any previously announced net asset value
per share, including any distributions declared). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the volume of purchases would be expected to increase
as the price of the Company s Common Stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any share repurchases
will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of the Company s Common Stock and trading volumes,
and no assurance can be given that Common Stock be repurchased in any particular amount or at all. The repurchase of shares pursuant to
the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise
be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit repurchases under certain circumstances. The Company 10b5-1 Plan
commenced beginning 60 calendar days following the end of the restricted period under Regulation M and will terminate upon
the earliest to occur of (i) the close of business on May 24, 2025, (ii) the end of the trading day on which the aggregate purchase price
for all shares purchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan equals and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described in the
Company 10b5-1 Plan. 

The restricted period under Regulation M ended upon the closing of the Company s IPO and, therefore, the Common Stock
repurchases/purchases described above began on July 23, 2024.

Portfolio and Investment Activity 

Our portfolio is currently comprised of a broad
mix of loans, with diversity among investment size and industry focus. The Advisor s team of professionals conducts due diligence
on prospective investments during the underwriting process and is involved in structuring the credit terms of our private middle market
investments. Once an investment has been made, our Advisor closely monitors that portfolio investment and takes a proactive approach to
identify and address sector or company specific risks. The Advisor seeks to maintain a regular dialogue with portfolio company management
teams (as well as their owners, the majority of whom are private equity firms, where applicable), reviews detailed operating and financial
results on a regular basis (typically monthly or quarterly) and monitors current and projected liquidity needs, in addition to other portfolio
management activities. There are no assurances that we will achieve our investment objectives. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in
110 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately 1,943 million, and unfunded commitments to these portfolio companies
of 179 million, and our portfolio consisted of 98.0 first lien senior secured loans, 0.9 subordinated debt and 1.1 equity investments. 

As of September 30, 2024, we held investments
in broadly syndicated loans in 22 portfolio companies with an aggregate principal amount of 270 million. Our investments in broadly syndicated
loans were made in anticipation of the receipt of proceeds from our final capital call and our IPO which closed during the second quarter
of 2024. Prior to these investments, we had not held broadly syndicated loans since 2022. Consistent with our strategy at that time, we
expect to rotate out of these investments over coming quarters to invest in private middle market loans consistent with our principal
strategy. We have presented certain portfolio-related information below for our private middle market loans and broadly syndicated loans
separately and on a combined basis for ease of reference. 

As of September 30, 2024, 100 of our debt investments
had floating interest rates. Our weighted average yields for debt investments were as follows: 

private
middle market loans at fair value and amortized cost weighted average yields were 11.9 and 12.0 , respectively 

broadly syndicated loans at fair value and amortized cost weighted average yields were 7.8 and 7.7 , respectively; and 

total debt investments
at fair value and amortized cost weighted average yields were 11.3 and 11.4 , respectively 

As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was invested
across 33 different industries (Global Industry Classification GICS , Level 3 Industry). The largest industries in
our portfolio as of September 30, 2024 were Trading Companies Distributors, Food Products, Commercial Services Supplies and
Containers Packaging, which represented, as a percentage of our portfolio of long-term investments, 14.6 , 9.7 , 7.8 and 7.7 ,
respectively, based on fair value. We are generalist investors and the mix of industries represented by our portfolio companies will vary
over time. 

As of September 30, 2024, our average position size based on commitment
of private credit investments (at the portfolio company level) was 21.3 million. 

50 

As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average
and median last twelve months LTM EBITDA of our portfolio companies were as follows: 

private middle market loans were 59.6 million and 33.7 million, respectively, based on fair value 1 

broadly syndicated loans were 2,050.3 million and 1,210.8 million, respectively, based on fair value; and 

total investments were 349.5 million and 41.7 million, respectively, based on fair value 1 

As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average
loan-to-enterprise-value LTEV of our debt investments at the time of our initial investment was as follows: 

private middle market loans was 43.2 , based on par 1 

broadly syndicated loans was 34.6 , based on par 

total
investments was 42.0 , based on par 1 ; and 

LTEV represents the total par value of our debt investment relative to our estimate of the enterprise value of the underlying borrower 

As of September 30, 2024, we had two debt investments
on non-accrual status, which represented 1.0 and 1.2 of total debt investments at fair value and cost, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio companies 
weighted average leverage ratios and weighted average interest coverage ratios (the calculations of which are based on the most recent
quarter end or latest available information from the portfolio companies) were as follows: 

private middle market loans were 4.4x and 2.9x, respectively, based on fair value 1 

broadly syndicated loans were 3.3x and 4.0x, respectively, based on fair value; and 

total investments were 4.2x and 3.1x, respectively, based on fair value 1 

As of September 30, 2024, the percentage of our
debt investments including at least one financial maintenance covenant was as follows: 

private middle market loans was 100.0 based on fair value 2 

broadly syndicated loans was 0 , based on fair value; and 

total investments was 85.7 , based on fair value 2 

1 Excludes
investments on watch list, which represent 3.7 of the total fair value of debt investments as of September 30, 2024. 

2 
 Excludes opportunistic deals, which represent 2.0 of the total fair value of debt investments as of September 30, 2024.

Portfolio Internal Performance Ratings 

In general, we employ a strategy designed to ensure
early detection of potential issues at underlying borrowers, including monthly financial reviews internal tracking memoranda, weekly watch
list discussions and other like activities. We have designed a risk rating system to aid in our portfolio management efforts where
each investment is rated level 1-9, where Level 1 is the least risky and Level 9 is the most risky. This risk-rating
system is quantitative in nature and aggregates criteria such as LTEV, leverage levels and fixed charge coverage ratios FCCR (each measured at point-in-time and as relates to levels at the close of the investment).

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

Our liquidity and capital resources are generated
primarily from the net proceeds of any offering of our shares of common stock, proceeds from borrowing on our credit facilities, proceeds
from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments
and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses,
repayments of borrowings under credit facilities and senior unsecured notes, and payment of cash distributions to our stockholders. 

56 

We finance our investments with leverage in the
form of borrowings under credit facilities and issuances of senior unsecured notes. We also intend to further borrow under credit facilities
and/or issue senior unsecured notes in the future in order to finance our investments. In accordance with the 1940 Act, we are required
to meet a coverage ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total borrowings and other senior securities
(and any preferred stock that we may issue in the future) of at least 150 . If this ratio declines below 150 , we cannot incur additional
leverage and could be required to sell a portion of our investments to repay some leverage when it is disadvantageous to do so. As of
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratios were 251 and 198 , respectively. We currently intend to target asset
coverage of 200 to 180 (which equates to a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0x to 1.25x) but may alter this target based
on market conditions. 

Over the next twelve months, we expect that cash
and cash equivalents, taken together with our available capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to conduct anticipated
investment activities. Beyond twelve months, we expect that our cash and liquidity needs will continue to be met by cash generated from
our ongoing operations as well as financing activities. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 75 million Notes outstanding, 713
million borrowed under our credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents of 61.8 million (including short-term investments). As of
that date, we had 437 million of undrawn commitments available on our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base restrictions and other
conditions). As of November 7, 2024, we had 75 million Notes outstanding, 740 million borrowed under our credit facilities and cash
and cash equivalents of 56.5 million (including short-term investments). 

IPO and Capital Contributions 

On May 24, 2024, we completed our IPO, issuing 6,000,000 shares
of our common stock at a public offering price of 16.63 per share. Net of underwriting fees and offering expenses, we received net cash
proceeds, of 92.4 million. The Company s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the
ticker symbol KBDC on May 22, 2024. 

On April
2, 2024, we issued 16,232,415 shares of our common stock related to capital called at an aggregate purchase price of 269.9 million. Following
the final close on April 2, 2024, we had called all of our capital relating to our 1,046.9 million in existing subscription agreements
that we had entered into with investors through a private offering, and we do not have any remaining undrawn capital commitments. 

Senior Unsecured Notes 

As of September 30, 2024, we have 75 million
of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with 25 million of 8.65 Series A Notes due June 2027 (the Series A Notes and 50
million of 8.74 Series B Notes due June 2028 (the Series B Notes , and collectively with the Series A Notes, the Notes ). 

Credit Facilities 

Corporate Credit Facility: As of September
30, 2024, we are party to a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Corporate Credit Facility ), that has a total commitment
of 400 million. The facility s commitment termination date and the final maturity date are February 18, 2026 and February 18, 2027,
respectively. The Corporate Credit Facility also provides for a feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the overall
size of the Corporate Credit Facility to a maximum of 550 million. The interest rate on the Corporate Credit Facility is equal to Term
SOFR (a forward-looking rate based on SOFR futures) plus an applicable spread of 2.35 per annum or an alternate base rate 
(as defined in the agreements governing the Corporate Credit Facility) plus an applicable spread of 1.25 . We are also required to pay
a commitment fee of 0.375 per annum on any unused portion of the Corporate Credit Facility. 

57 

Revolving Funding Facility: As of September
30, 2024, we and our wholly owned, special purpose financing subsidiary, Kayne Anderson BDC Financing, LLC KABDCF ), are
party to a senior secured revolving funding facility (the Revolving Funding Facility ). We and KABDCF have a commitment of
 600 million. The Revolving Funding Facility is secured by all of the assets held by, and the membership interest in, KABDCF. The end
of the reinvestment period was extended to April 2, 2027 and the maturity date was extended to April 3, 2029. The interest rate on the
Revolving Funding Facility was reduced from daily SOFR plus 2.75 per annum to SOFR plus 2.375 - 2.50 per annum depending on the mix
of loans securing the Revolving Funding Facility. 

KABDCF is also required to pay a commitment fee
of between 0.50 and 1.50 per annum depending on the size of the unused portion of the Revolving Funding Facility. 

Revolving Funding Facility II: As of September
30, 2024, we and our wholly owned, special purpose financing subsidiary, Kayne Anderson BDC Financing II, LLC KABDCF II ),
are party to a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Funding Facility II ). The Revolving Funding Facility
II has an initial commitment of 150 million which, under certain circumstances, can be increased up to 500 million. The Revolving Funding
Facility II is secured by all of the assets held by KABDCF II and the Company has agreed that it will not grant or allow a lien on the
membership interest of KABDCF II. The end of the reinvestment period and the stated maturity date for the Revolving Funding Facility II
are December 22, 2026, and December 22, 2028, respectively. The interest rate on the Revolving Funding Facility II is equal to 3-month
term SOFR plus 2.70 per annum. KABDCF II is also required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50 between December 22, 2023 and September 22,
2024 and 0.75 thereafter on the unused portion of the Revolving Funding Facility II.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
we had an aggregate 179.0 million and 147.9 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments to provide debt financing to our portfolio
companies. Such commitments are generally subject to the satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our financial statements. Other than contractual commitments
and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any other off-balance sheet financings or
liabilities. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of our consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses.
Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual
results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described
below. The critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with our risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information on our critical accounting policies.

Investment Valuation 

Traded Investments (Level 1 or Level 2) 

Investments for which market quotations are readily
available will typically be valued at those market quotations. Traded investments such as corporate bonds, preferred stock, bank notes,
broadly syndicated loans or loan participations are valued by using the bid price provided by an independent pricing service, by an independent
broker, the agent bank, syndicate bank or principal market maker. When price quotes for investments are not available, or such prices
are stale or do not represent fair value in the judgment of our Advisor, fair market value will be determined using our Advisor s
valuation process for investments that are privately issued or otherwise restricted as to resale. 

We may also invest, to a lesser extent, in equity
securities purchased in conjunction with debt investments. While we anticipate these equity securities to be issued by privately held
companies, we may hold equity securities that are publicly traded. Equity securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ Stock
Market, Inc. NASDAQ are valued, except as indicated below, at the last sale price on the business day as of which such
value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and ask
prices on such day. Securities admitted to trade on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. Equity securities traded
on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of which such value is being determined
at the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such securities. Equity securities traded in the over-the-counter market,
but excluding securities admitted to trading on the NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. 

Non-Traded Investments (Level 3) 

Investments that are privately issued or otherwise
restricted as to resale, as well as any security for which (a) reliable market quotations are not available in the judgment of our
Advisor, or (b) the independent pricing service or independent broker does not provide prices or provides a price that in the judgment
of our Advisor is stale or does not represent fair value, shall each be valued in a manner that most fairly reflects fair value of the
security on the valuation date. We expect that a significant majority of our investments will be Level 3 investments. Unless otherwise
determined by the Advisor, the following valuation process is used for our Level 3 investments: 

Valuation Designee . The applicable investments will be valued no less frequently than quarterly by the Advisor, with new investments valued at the time such investment was made. The value of each Level 3 investment will be initially reviewed by the persons responsible for such portfolio company or investment. The Advisor will use a standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs to determine a preliminary value. The Advisor will specify the titles of the persons responsible for determining the fair value of Company investments, including by specifying the particular functions for which they are responsible, and will reasonably segregate fair value determinations from the portfolio management of the Company such that the portfolio manager(s) may not determine, or effectively determine by exerting substantial influence on, the fair values ascribed to portfolio investments. 

Valuation Firm . Quarterly, a third-party valuation firm engaged by the Advisor reviews the valuation methodologies and calculations employed for each of the Company s investments that the Advisor has placed on the watch list and approximately 25 of the Company s remaining investments. The third-party valuation firm will review and independently value all of the Level 3 investments at least once per year, on a rolling twelve-month basis. The quarterly report issued by the third-party valuation firm will provide positive assurance on the fair values of the investments reviewed. 

Oversight . The Board has appointed the Advisor as the valuation designee for the Company for purposes of making determinations of fair value as permitted by Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. The Audit Committee shall aid the Board in overseeing the Advisor s fair valuation of securities that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. The Audit Committee shall meet quarterly to review the fair value determinations, processes and written reports of the Advisor as part of the Board s oversight responsibilities. 

Refer to Note 5 Fair Value for
more information on the Company s valuation process. 

59 

Revenue Recognition 

We record interest income on an accrual basis
to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual
interest accrued and added to the principal balance, we generally will not accrue PIK interest for accounting purposes if the portfolio
company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities
for accounting purposes if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. OIDs, market discounts or premiums are accreted
or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest
income. 

Related Party Transactions 

Investment Advisory Agreement. On February 5,
2021, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Advisor. In addition, on March 6, 2024, the Board approved an amended
and restated investment advisory agreement (the Amended Investment Advisory Agreement and a fee waiver agreement (the
 Fee Waiver Agreement between the Company and the Advisor, which became effective upon the completion of the initial public
offering of shares of common stock on May 24, 2024 (the IPO Date ). On March 6, 2024, the Board approved an additional one-year
term of the Investment Advisory Agreement from March 16, 2024 to March 15, 2025. 

For services rendered under the Investment Advisory
Agreement, we pay a base management fee quarterly in arrears to our Advisor based on the of the fair market value of our investments including,
in each case, assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage, but excluding cash, U.S. government securities and commercial
paper instruments maturing within one year of purchase. We also pay an incentive fee on income and an incentive fee on capital gains to
our Advisor. 

The Amended
Investment Advisory Agreement is materially the same as the Investment Advisory Agreement except, following the IPO Date, the base management
fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00 and the incentive fee on income is subject to a twelve-quarter lookback quarterly
hurdle rate of 1.50 as opposed to a single quarter measurement and is subject to an Incentive Fee Cap based on our Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee
Net Return. This lookback feature provides that the Advisor s income incentive fee may be reduced if our portfolio experiences
aggregate write-downs or net capital losses during the applicable Trailing Twelve Quarters. Pursuant to the Fee Waiver Agreement,
commencing on the IPO Date, the Advisor implemented waivers of (i) the income incentive fee for three calendar quarters commencing
the quarter the initial public offering was completed and (ii) a portion of the base management fee for one year following the completion
of the initial public offering. Amounts waived by the Advisor pursuant to the Fee Waiver Agreement are not subject to recoupment by the
Advisor. 

Administration Agreement. On February 5,
2021, we entered into the Administration Agreement with our Advisor, which serves as our Administrator and will provide or oversee the
performance of its required administrative services and professional services rendered by others, which will include (but are not limited
to), accounting, payment of our expenses, legal, compliance, operations, technology and investor relations, preparation and filing of
its tax returns, and preparation of financial reports provided to its stockholders and filed with the SEC. On March 6, 2024, the Board
approved an additional one-year term of the Administration Agreement through March 15, 2025. 

We will reimburse the Administrator for its costs
and expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, which may include its allocable portion of office
facilities, overhead, and compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by its officers (including our Chief Compliance
Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and its respective staff who provide services to the Company. As the Company reimburses the Administrator
for its expenses, such costs (including the costs of sub-administrators) will be ultimately borne by common stockholders. The Administrator
does not receive compensation from us other than reimbursement of its expenses. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either
party with 60 days written notice. 

Since the inception of the Company, the Administrator has engaged sub-administrators
to assist the Administrator in performing certain of its administrative duties. During this period, the Administrator has not sought reimbursement
of its expenses other than expenses incurred by the sub-administrators. The Administrator has engaged Ultimus Fund Solutions, LLC under
a sub-administration agreement. Under the terms of the sub-administration agreement, Ultimus Fund Solutions, LLC will provide fund administration
and fund accounting services. The Company pays fees to Ultimus Fund Solutions, LLC, which constitute reimbursable expenses under the Administration
Agreement. The Administrator may enter into additional sub-administration agreements with third-parties to perform other administrative
and professional services on behalf of the Administrator. 

Non-Controlled, Affiliated Investment .
We hold Trademark Global LLC and TG Parent Newco LLC (Trademark Global LLC), both non-controlled, affiliated investments, as defined in
the 1940 Act. See Item 1. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions 
for further details.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

We are subject to financial market risks, including
changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of
interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income will be affected by the difference
between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change
in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 

Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities
as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following
table shows the annualized impact in millions) of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rate (considering interest rate floors
for floating rate instruments). We do not include our investments on non-accrual status and classified as non-incoming producing as of
September 30, 2024 in this calculation.

The data in the table is based on the Company s
current statement of assets and liabilities. 

We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations
by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While
hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits
of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period
covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in our periodic United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

Neither we nor our Advisor is currently subject
to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us, or against our Advisor. 

From time to time, we, or our Advisor, may be
a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights
under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not
expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 

From time to time we are involved in various legal
proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business. Our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which
may result in regulatory proceedings against us.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds. 

Sales of Unregistered Securities 

As set forth in the table below (dollars in thousands,
except per share and share amounts), during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold 23,322,186 shares of common stock
at an aggregate offering amount of approximately 388.6 million. The issuance of the shares of common stock was exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D thereof and previously reported by us
on our current reports on Form 8-K. The Company relied, in part, upon representations from the investors in the subscription agreements
that each investor was an accredited investor as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.

Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities 

On May 21,
2024, the Company entered into a share repurchase plan, or the Company 10b5-1 Plan, to acquire up to 100 million in the aggregate of
the Company s Common Stock at prices below the Company s net asset value per share over a specified period, in accordance
with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company 10b5-1 Plan
was approved by the Board of Directors on March 6, 2024. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires Morgan Stanley Corporation as the Company s
agent, to repurchase Common Stock on its behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported net asset value per
share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by the Company to any previously announced net asset value
per share, including any distributions declared). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the volume of purchases would be expected to increase
as the price of the Company s Common Stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any share repurchases
will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of the Company s Common Stock and trading volumes,
and no assurance can be given that Common Stock be repurchased in any particular amount or at all. The repurchase of shares pursuant to
the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise
be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit repurchases under certain circumstances. The Company 10b5-1 Plan
commenced beginning 60 calendar days following the end of the restricted period under Regulation M and will terminate upon
the earliest to occur of (i) the close of business on May 24, 2025, (ii) the end of the trading day on which the aggregate purchase price
for all shares purchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan equals 100 million and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described
in the Company 10b5-1 Plan. 

The restricted
period under Regulation M ended upon the closing of the Company s IPO and, therefore, the Common Stock repurchases/purchases
described above began on July 23, 2024. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company repurchase 68,680 shares under the Company s 10b5-1 Plan for a total of 1,107.
