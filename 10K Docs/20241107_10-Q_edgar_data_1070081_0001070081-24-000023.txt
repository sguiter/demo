 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) September 30, 2024 In thousands (except share and per share amounts unless otherwise noted) products, Translarna (ataluren) and Emflaza (deflazacort), for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD ), a rare, life-threatening disorder. Translarna has marketing authorization in the European Economic Area (the EEA for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged two years and older. Translarna also has marketing authorization in Russia for the treatment of nmDMD in patients aged two years and older and in Brazil for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients two years and older and for continued treatment of patients that become non-ambulatory, as well as in various other countries. Emflaza is approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients two years and older. The Company s marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission EC following reassessment by the European Medicines Agency EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, which the Company refers to as the annual EMA reassessment. In September 2022, the Company submitted a Type II variation to the EMA to support conversion of the conditional marketing authorization for Translarna to a standard marketing authorization, which included a report on the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041 and data from the open-label extension. In February 2023, the Company also submitted an annual marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA. In September 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use CHMP ), gave a negative opinion on the conversion of the conditional marketing authorization to full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and a negative opinion on the renewal of the existing conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In January 2024, the CHMP issued a negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure. In May 2024, the EC decided not to adopt the CHMP s negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna and returned such opinion to the CHMP for re-evaluation. In June 2024, following the EC s request for re-review, the CHMP issued a negative opinion on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. On October 18, 2024, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following the requested reexamination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the opinion will be reviewed by the EC which is expected to decide on opinion adoption approximately 67 days from the date of issuance. If the EC adopts the negative opinion, Translarna would no longer have marketing authorization in the member states of the EEA. The marketing authorization for Translarna remains in effect, pending the EC s potential adoption of the negative opinion. Based on the timeline of these procedures, the Company expects the marketing authorization for Translarna to remain in effect approximately through the end of 2024. Translarna is an investigational new drug in the United States. Following the Company s announcement of top-line results from the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041 in June 2022, the Company submitted a meeting request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA to gain clarity on the regulatory pathway for a potential re-submission of a New Drug Application NDA for Translarna. The FDA provided initial written feedback that Study 041 does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to support an NDA re-submission. The Company held a Type C meeting with the

The Company has also relied on revenue associated with milestone and royalty payments from Roche pursuant to the License and Collaboration Agreement (the SMA License Agreement dated as of November 23, 2011, by and among the Company, Roche and, for the limited purposes set forth therein, the SMA Foundation, under its SMA program.

 , imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI provisions of the TCJA require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary s tangible assets. The Company has elected to account for GILTI tax in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024. Since 2022, TCJA amendments to IRC Section 174 no longer permit an immediate deduction for research and development expenditures in the tax year that such costs are incurred. Instead, these IRC Section 174 development costs must now be capitalized and amortized over either a five- or 15-year period, depending on the location of the activities performed. The new amortization period begins with the midpoint of any taxable year that IRC Section 174 costs are first incurred, regardless of whether the expenditures were made prior to or after July 1, and runs until the midpoint of year five for activities conducted in the United States or year 15 in the case of development conducted on foreign soil. This tax law change is anticipated to result in an increased current taxable income of the Company by million for the year ending December 31, 2024. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is not more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will be realized.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis is meant to provide material information relevant to an assessment of the financial condition and results of operations of our company, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside resources, so as to allow investors to better view our company from management s perspective. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024, as amended, or our 2023 Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in Part II, Item 1A. (Risk Factors) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A. (Risk Factors) of our 2023 Annual Report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Our Company We are a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated medicines that provide benefits to children and adults living with rare disorders. Our ability to innovate to identify new therapies and to globally commercialize products is the foundation that drives investment in a robust and diversified pipeline of transformative medicines. Our mission is to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have little to no treatment options. Our strategy is to leverage our strong scientific and clinical expertise and global commercial infrastructure to bring therapies to patients. We believe that this allows us to maximize value for all our stakeholders. We have a diversified therapeutic portfolio pipeline that includes several commercial products and product candidates in various stages of development, including clinical, pre-clinical and research and discovery stages, focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas for rare diseases relating to neurology and metabolism. Corporate Updates Global Commercial Footprint Global DMD Franchise We have two products, Translarna (ataluren) and Emflaza (deflazacort), for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, a rare, life-threatening disorder. Translarna currently has conditional marketing authorization in the European Economic Area, or EEA, for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or nmDMD, in ambulatory patients aged two years and older. Translarna also has marketing authorization in Russia for the treatment of nmDMD in patients aged two years and older, and in Brazil for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients two years and older and for continued treatment of patients that become non-ambulatory, as well as in various other countries. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 72.3 million in net sales of Translarna. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to Translarna for all indications in all territories. Emflaza is approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients two years and older. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 51.9 million in net sales of Emflaza. Our marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission, or EC, following reassessment by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment. In September 2022, we submitted a Type II variation to the EMA to support conversion of the conditional marketing authorization for Translarna to a standard marketing authorization, which included a report on the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041 and data from the open-label extension as further described below. Study 041 was an 18-month, placebo-controlled trial, followed by an 18-month open-label extension of Translarna in the treatment of ambulatory patients with nmDMD aged five years or older. In February 2023, we also submitted an annual marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA. In September 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, gave a negative opinion on the conversion of the conditional marketing authorization to full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and a negative opinion on the 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 renewal of the existing conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In January 2024, the CHMP issued a negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure. In May 2024, the EC decided not to adopt the CHMP s negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna and returned such opinion to the CHMP for re-evaluation. In June 2024, following the EC s request for re-review, the CHMP issued a negative opinion on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. On October 18, 2024, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following the requested reexamination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the opinion will be reviewed by the EC which is expected to decide on opinion adoption approximately 67 days from the date of issuance. If the EC adopts the negative opinion, Translarna would no longer have marketing authorization in the member states of the EEA. The marketing authorization for Translarna remains in effect, pending the EC s potential adoption of the negative opinion. Based on the timeline of these procedures, we expect the marketing authorization for Translarna to remain in effect approximately through the end of 2024 . We are exploring other potential mechanisms by which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA if the negative opinion is adopted by the EC. Each country, including each member state of the EEA, has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations. In order to commence commercial sale of product pursuant to our Translarna marketing authorization in any particular country in the EEA, we must finalize pricing and reimbursement negotiations with the applicable government body in such country. As a result, our commercial launch will continue to be on a country-by-country basis. We also have made, and expect to continue to make, product available under early access programs, or EAP programs, or similar styled programs both in countries in the EEA and other territories. Our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain reimbursement for product under commercial and EAP programs can be subject to challenge in any particular country and can also be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in such country. There is substantial risk that if the EC adopts the CHMP s negative opinion, or we are otherwise unable to renew our EEA marketing authorization during any annual renewal cycle, or we are unable to identify other potential mechanisms by which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA should the EC adopt the CHMP s negative opinion or our product label is materially restricted , we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna in the EEA and other territories. Translarna is an investigational new drug in the United States. During the first quarter of 2017, we filed a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD over protest with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In October 2017, the Office of Drug Evaluation I of the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA, stating that it was unable to approve the application in its current form. In response, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the Office of New Drugs of the FDA. In February 2018, the Office of New Drugs of the FDA denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter. In its response, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for the ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients muscles. We followed the FDA s recommendation and collected, using newer technologies via procedures and methods that we designed, such dystrophin data in a new study, Study 045, and announced the results of Study 045 in February 2021. Study 045 did not meet its pre-specified primary endpoint. In June 2022, we announced top-line results from the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041. Following this announcement, we submitted a meeting request to the FDA to gain clarity on the regulatory pathway for a potential re-submission of an NDA for Translarna. The FDA provided initial written feedback that Study 041 does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to support NDA re-submission. We held a Type C meeting with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 to discuss the totality of Translarna data. Based on feedback from the FDA, we re-submitted the NDA in July 2024, based on the results from Study 041 and from our international drug registry study for nmDMD patients receiving Translarna. In October 2024, the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of the NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. As this was an NDA resubmission following a complete response letter to the NDA which was filed over protest in 2016, the FDA is not obligated to follow the review timelines under Prescription Drug User Free Act guidelines and an action date has not been provided. We have previously relied on Emflaza s seven-year marketing exclusivity period in the United States for its approved indications under the provisions of the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or the Orphan Drug Act, when commercializing Emflaza.

Table of Contents 
 Emflaza s seven-year period of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older expired in February 2024. We expect the expiration of this orphan drug exclusivity to have a significant negative impact on Emflaza net product revenue. Emflaza s orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients two years of age to less than five expires in June 2026. Upstaza (eladocagene exuparvovec) Our product Upstaza is a gene therapy used for the treatment of Aromatic L-Amino Decarboxylase, or AADC, deficiency, a rare central nervous system, or CNS, disorder arising from reductions in the enzyme AADC that results from mutations in the dopa decarboxylase gene. In July 2022, the EC approved Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency for patients 18 months and older within the EEA. In November 2022, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency approved Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency for patients 18 months and older within the United Kingdom. In March 2024, we submitted a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA for eladocagene exuparvovec for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States. In May 2024, the FDA accepted for filing the BLA for eladocagene exuparvovec for the treatment of AADC deficiency and granted priority review with a target regulatory action date of November 13, 2024. Tegsedi (inotersen) and Waylivra (volanesorsen) We hold the rights for the commercialization of Tegsedi and Waylivra for the treatment of rare diseases in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean pursuant to a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement, dated August 1, 2018, by and between us and Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., or Akcea, a subsidiary of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Tegsedi has received marketing authorization in the United States, European Union, or EU, and Brazil for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis. In August 2021, ANVISA, the Brazilian health regulatory authority, approved Waylivra as the first treatment for familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, in Brazil. In December 2022, ANVISA approved Waylivra for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. Waylivra has also received marketing authorization in the EU for the treatment of FCS. Evrysdi (risdiplam) We also have a spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, collaboration with F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd. and Hoffman La Roche inc., which we refer to collectively as Roche, and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, or SMA Foundation. The SMA program has one approved product, Evrysdi (risdiplam), which was approved by the FDA in August 2020 for the treatment of SMA in adults and children two months and older and by the EC in March 2021 for the treatment of 5q SMA in patients two months and older with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four SMN2 copies. Evrysdi also received marketing authorization for the treatment of SMA in over 100 countries. In May 2022, the FDA approved a label expansion for Evrysdi to include infants under two months old with SMA. In August 2023, the EC approved an extension of the Evrysdi marketing authorization to include infants under two months old in the EU. Diversified Development Pipeline Sepiapterin One of our most advanced clinical stage molecules is sepiapterin. Sepiapterin is a precursor to intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin, which is a critical enzymatic cofactor involved in metabolism and synthesis of numerous metabolic products. In May 2023, we announced that the primary endpoint was achieved in our registration-directed Phase 3 trial for sepiapterin for phenylketonuria, or PKU. The primary endpoint of the study was the achievement of statistically-significant reduction in blood Phe level. The primary analysis population included those patients who have a greater than 30 reduction in blood Phe levels during the Part 1 run-in phase of the trial. Sepiapterin demonstrated Phe level reduction of approximately 63 in the overall primary analysis population and Phe level reduction of approximately 69 in the subset for classical PKU patients. Additionally, sepiapterin was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Following the placebo-controlled study, patients were eligible to enroll in a long-term open-label study, which is still ongoing and will evaluate long-term safety, durability and Phe tolerance. In March 2024, we submitted a marketing authorization

 application, or MAA, to the EMA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in the EEA, which was validated and accepted for review by the EMA in May 2024. In the third quarter of 2023, we participated in a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA. At that meeting, the FDA stated that the sepiapterin clinical safety and efficacy data supported NDA submission for the treatment of pediatric and adult PKU patients. However, the FDA requested that we complete a 26-week nonclinical mouse study to assess sepiapterin carcinogenicity potential prior to NDA submission. This nonclinical study was not initially required when we acquired sepiapterin, as the NDA submission was planned under the Section 505(b)(2) pathway. Given that sepiapterin is a novel therapy with distinct pharmacology, biodistribution, mechanism of action and differentiated efficacy, we subsequently decided to make the NDA submission under the Section 505(b)(1) pathway, which requires the 26-week study, which is considered a required NDA component needed to inform labeling and is typically completed prior to submission. In July 2024, following completion of the in-life portion of the study, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with PKU, including the full spectrum of ages and disease subtypes, in the United States . In September 2024, the FDA accepted for filing the NDA, with a target regulatory action date of July 29, 2025. We also made a regulatory submission for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in Brazil in the third quarter of 2024, and expect to do the same in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2024. Splicing Platform In addition to our SMA program, our splicing platform also includes PTC518, which is being developed for the treatment of Huntington s disease, or HD. We announced the results from our Phase 1 study of PTC518 in healthy volunteers in September 2021 demonstrating dose-dependent lowering of huntingtin messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels, that PTC518 efficiently crosses blood brain barrier at significant levels and that PTC518 was well tolerated. We initiated a Phase 2 study of PTC518 for the treatment of HD in the first quarter of 2022, which consists of an initial 12-week placebo-controlled phase focused on safety, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic effects followed by a nine-month placebo-controlled phase focused on PTC518 biomarker effect. In June 2023, we announced interim data from the 12-week placebo-controlled phase. The study demonstrated dose-dependent lowering of Huntingtin, or HTT, protein levels in peripheral blood cells, reaching an approximate mean 30 reduction in mutant HTT levels at the 10mg dose level. In addition, PTC518 exposure in the cerebrospinal fluid was consistent with or higher than plasma unbound drug levels. Furthermore, PTC518 was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events. In June 2024, we announced additional interim results from the Phase 2 study of PTC518. At month 12, PTC518 treatment demonstrated durable dose-dependent lowering of mutant HTT, or mHTT, protein in the blood and dose-dependent lowering of mHTT protein in the cerebrospinal fluid in the interim cohort of stage 2 patients. In addition, favorable trends were demonstrated on several relevant HD clinical assessments. Furthermore, following 12 months of treatment, PTC518 continued to be well tolerated. Based on its review of the interim Phase 2 study data, the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold on the program. In September 2024, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the PTC518 program for the treatment of HD. Ferroptosis and Inflammation Platform Our ferroptosis and inflammation platform consists of small molecule compounds that target oxidoreductase enzymes that regulate oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways central to the pathology of a number of CNS diseases. The two most advanced molecules in our ferroptosis and inflammation platform are vatiquinone and utreloxastat. We announced topline results from a registration-directed Phase 3 trial of vatiquinone in children and young adults with Friedreich ataxia, or FA, called MOVE-FA, in May 2023. While the study did not meet its primary endpoint of statistically significant change in modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale, or mFARS, score at 72 weeks in the primary analysis population, vatiquinone treatment did demonstrate significant benefit on key disease subscales and secondary endpoints. In addition, in the population of subjects that completed the study protocol, significance was reached in the mFARS endpoint and several secondary endpoints, including the upright stability subscale. Furthermore, vatiquinone was well tolerated. In the first quarter of 2024, we met with the FDA, who expressed willingness to review an NDA for vatiquinone for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia based on the MOVE-FA trial as well as data from the ongoing open label extension study following the MOVE-FA trial. In October 2024, we announced that the pre-specified endpoint for two different FA long-term extension studies was met, with statistically significant evidence of durable treatment benefit on disease progression. We plan to submit an NDA for vatiquinone for the treatment of FA in the United States in December 2024. In the third quarter of 2021, we completed a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety and pharmacology of utreloxastat. Utreloxastat was found to be well-tolerated with no reported serious adverse events while demonstrating predictable

 pharmacology. We initiated a Phase 2 registration directed trial of utreloxastat for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, in the first quarter of 2022. We expect topline results from this trial in the fourth quarter of 2024. Multi-Platform Discovery In addition, we have a pipeline of product candidates and discovery programs that are in early clinical, pre-clinical and research and development stages focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases. Funding The success of our products and any other product candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement from governments and third-party insurers. Our revenues are primarily generated from sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in countries where we were able to obtain acceptable commercial pricing and reimbursement terms and in select countries where we are permitted to distribute Translarna under our EAP programs or through similar styled programs, and from sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States. We also generate revenue from sales of Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA and have recognized revenue associated with milestone and royalty payments from Roche pursuant to a License and Collaboration Agreement, or the SMA License Agreement, by and among us, Roche and, for the limited purposes set forth therein, the SMA Foundation, under our SMA program . To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the private offerings of convertible senior notes, public and at the market offerings of common stock, proceeds from royalty purchase agreements, net proceeds from our borrowings under our credit agreement with Blackstone, private placements of our convertible preferred stock and common stock, collaborations, bank and institutional lender debt, other convertible debt, grant funding and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease area addressed by our product candidates. . We have relied on revenue generated from net sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States since 2014, Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States since 2017 and Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA since 2022. We have also relied on revenue associated with milestone and royalty payments from Roche pursuant to the SMA License Agreement, under our SMA program. In June 2024, we entered into an amendment with Royalty Pharma Investments 2019 ICAV, or Royalty Pharma, and Royalty Pharma plc, to the Amended and Restated Royalty Purchase Agreement, dated October 18, 2023, or the A R Royalty Purchase Agreement, which amends and restates in its entirety the Royalty Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 17, 2020, or the Original Royalty Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the A R Royalty Purchase Agreement, we have sold to Royalty Pharma a portion of our right to receive sales-based royalty payments, or the Royalty, on worldwide net sales of Evrysdi and any other product developed pursuant to the SMA License Agreement under the SMA program. To date, Royalty Pharma has paid to us cash consideration of 1.9 billion (less Royalty payments received by us with respect to assigned Royalties, or the Assigned Royalty Rights) in exchange for 90.49 of the Royalty, which will be reduced to 83.33 after Royalty Pharma receives 1.3 billion in aggregate payments, or the Assigned Royalty Cap, from the Royalty assigned under the Original Royalty Purchase Agreement. We currently retain 9.51 of the Royalty, which increases to 16.67 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met. We have the option to sell our retained portions of the Royalty to Royalty Pharma in up to three tranches for the following payments: (1) 100.0 million in exchange for 3.81 of the Royalty, which increases to 6.67 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, (2) 100.0 million in exchange for 3.81 of the Royalty, which increases to 6.67 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, and (3) 50.0 million in exchange for 1.90 of the Royalty, which increases to 3.33 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, in each case less Royalty payments received by us with respect to the Assigned Royalty Rights. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and capital resources Sources of Liquidity for additional information. The 2026 Convertible Notes consist of 287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50 convertible senior notes due 2026. The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 1.50 per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on September 15,

 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. We received net proceeds of 279.3 million after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us. In August 2019, we entered into an At the Market Offering Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, or together, the Sales Agents, pursuant to which, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 125.0 million from time to time through the Sales Agents by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not issue or sell any shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. The remaining shares of our common stock available to be issued and sold, under the Sales Agreement, have an aggregate offering price of up to 93.0 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 3,581.0 million. We had a net loss of 297.4 million and 470.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our commercialization efforts in the United States, the EEA, Latin America and other territories, including expenses related to our commercial infrastructure and corresponding sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, and distribution and manufacturing undertakings as well as administrative and employee-based expenses. In addition to the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with ongoing, planned and potential future clinical trials and studies for sepiapterin and our splicing and ferroptosis and inflammation programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications. We continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories that we do not currently have marketing authorization in. Additionally, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD following the request for re-examination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the opinion will be reviewed by the EC which is expected to decide on opinion adoption approximately 67 days from the date of issuance. We are also exploring other potential mechanisms by which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA if the negative opinion is adopted by the EC. In March 2024, we submitted a BLA to the FDA for our gene therapy for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States. In May 2024, the FDA accepted the filing for the BLA and granted priority review with a target regulatory action date of November 13, 2024. In March 2024, we submitted an MAA, to the EMA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in the EEA. In July 2024, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in the United States. I n September 2024, the FDA accepted for filing the NDA, with a target regulatory action date of July 29, 2025. These efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization and manufacturing expenses . We may seek to expand and diversify our product pipeline through opportunistically in-licensing or acquiring the rights to products, product candidates or technologies and we may incur expenses, including with respect to transaction costs, subsequent development costs or any upfront, milestone or other payments or other financial obligations associated with any such transaction, which would increase our future capital requirements. In July 2024, we announced the submission of an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in the United States. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 5, 2020, or the Censa Merger Agreement, by and among us, Hydro Merger Sub, Inc., our wholly owned, indirect subsidiary, Censa Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Censa, and, solely in its capacity as the representative, agent and attorney in fact of the securityholders of Censa, Shareholder Representative Services, LLC, the decision to submit the NDA triggered a 25.0 million regulatory milestone to the former Censa securityholders. In September 2024, we announced the FDA acceptance for filing of the NDA. Pursuant to the Censa Merger Agreement, the acceptance triggered a 25.0 million regulatory milestone to the former Censa securityholders. Together, the 50.0 million of regulatory milestones were recorded in research and development expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and are recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, we expect to pay 4.5 million in regulatory milestone payments upon the approval of eladocagene exuparvovec for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States from the FDA pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 19, 2018, or the Agilis Merger Agreement, by and among us, Agility Merger Sub, Inc., a

 Delaware corporation and our wholly owned, indirect subsidiary, Agilis and, solely in its capacity as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the equityholders of Agilis, Shareholder Representative Services LLC. We also have certain significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments that require funding and we have disclosed these items under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Funding Obligations in our 2023 Annual Report. There were no material changes to these obligations and commitments during the period ended September 30, 2024. Furthermore, since we are a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as such including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. We have never been profitable and we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never do so. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts. Financial operations overview Revenues Net product revenues. To date, our net product revenues have consisted primarily of sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States and sales of Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States. We recognize revenue when performance obligations with customers have been satisfied. Our performance obligations are to provide products based on customer orders from distributors, hospitals, specialty pharmacies or retail pharmacies. The performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time when our customer obtains control of the product, which is typically upon delivery. We invoice customers after the products have been delivered and invoice payments are generally due within 30 to 90 days of invoice date. We determine the transaction price based on fixed consideration in its contractual agreements. Contract liabilities arise in certain circumstances when consideration is due for goods not yet provided. As we have identified only one distinct performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated entirely to the product sale. In determining the transaction price, a significant financing component does not exist since the timing from when we deliver product to when the customers pay for the product is typically less than one year. Customers in certain countries pay in advance of product delivery. In those instances, payment and delivery typically occur in the same month. We record product sales net of any variable consideration, which includes discounts, allowances, rebates related to Medicaid and other government pricing programs, and distribution fees. We use the expected value or most likely amount method when estimating variable consideration, unless discount or rebate terms are specified within contracts. The identified variable consideration is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. These estimates for variable consideration are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such estimates in the quarter those changes are known. Revenue recognized does not include amounts of variable consideration that are constrained. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net product sales outside of the United States were 83.5 million and 76.6 million, respectively, consisting of sales of Translarna, Tegsedi, Waylivra, and Upstaza. Translarna net revenues made up 72.3 million and 69.0 million of the net product sales outside of the United States for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net product sales in the United States were 51.9 million and 67.4 million, respectively, consisting solely of sales of Emflaza. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, two countries, the United States and Brazil, accounted for at least 10 of the Company s net product sales, representing 51.9 million and 29.2 million of the net product sales, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, one country, the United States, accounted for at least 10 of the Company s net product sales, representing 67.4 million of the net product sales, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had two and three distributors, respectively, accounted for over 10 of the Company s net product sales.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net product sales outside of the United States were 289.5 million and 318.5 million, respectively consisting of sales of Translarna, Tegsedi, Waylivra and Upstaza. Translarna net revenues made up 246.2 million and 280.6 million of the net product sales outside of the United States for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net product sales in the United States were 156.7 million and 187.7 million, respectively, consisting solely of sales of Emflaza. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, three countries, the United States, Brazil, and Russia, accounted for at least 10 of our net product sales, representing 156.7 million, 68.3 million, and 55.7 million of net product sales, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, three countries, the United States, Russia, and Brazil, accounted for at least 10 of our net product sales, representing 187.7 million, 69.0 million, and 52.5 million of net product sales, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a total of two and two distributors, respectively, that each accounted for over 10 of our net product sales. In relation to customer contracts, we incur costs to fulfill a contract but do not incur costs to obtain a contract. These costs to fulfill a contract do not meet the criteria for capitalization and are expensed as incurred. We consider any shipping and handling costs that are incurred after the customer has obtained control of the product as a cost to fulfill a promise. Shipping and handling costs associated with finished goods delivered to customers are recorded as a selling expense. Roche and the SMA Foundation Collaboration. In November 2011, we entered into the SMA License Agreement pursuant to which we are collaborating with Roche and the SMA Foundation to further develop and commercialize compounds identified under our SMA program with the SMA Foundation. The research component of this agreement terminated effective December 31, 2014. We are eligible to receive additional payments from Roche if specified events are achieved with respect to each licensed product, including up to 135.0 million in research and development event milestones, up to 325.0 million in sales milestones upon achievement of specified sales events, and up to double digit royalties on worldwide annual net sales of a commercial product. As of September 30, 2024, we had recognized a total of 310.0 million in milestone payments and 487.5 million royalties on net sales pursuant to the SMA License Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there are no remaining research and development event milestones that we can receive. The remaining potential sales milestones as of September 30, 2024 are 150.0 million upon achievement of certain sales events. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not recognize collaboration revenue related to the SMA License Agreement with Roche. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amounts recognized for the collaboration revenue related to the SMA License Agreement with Roche were immaterial. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 61.4 million and 145.7 million of royalty revenue, respectively, related to Evrysdi. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 50.2 million and 117.9 million of royalty revenue, respectively, related to Evrysdi. In July 2020, we entered into the Original Royalty Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Original Royalty Purchase Agreement, we sold to Royalty Pharma 42.933 , or the Original Assigned Royalty Rights, of the Royalty for 650.0 million. At that time, we retained a 57.067 interest in the Royalty and all economic rights to receive the remaining potential regulatory and sales milestone payments under the SMA License Agreement. Pursuant to the A R Royalty Purchase Agreement, Royalty Pharma has paid to us aggregate cash consideration of 1.9 billion (less Royalty payments received by us with respect to the Assigned Royalty Rights) in exchange for 90.49 of the Royalty, which will be reduced to 83.33 of the Royalty after Royalty Pharma receives 1.3 billion in aggregate payments from the Royalty assigned at the closing of the Original Purchase Agreement. We currently retain 9.51 of the Royalty, which increases to 16.67 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, and all economic rights to receive the remaining potential regulatory and sales milestone payments under the SMA License Agreement. We have the option to sell our retained portions of the Royalty to Royalty Pharma in up to three tranches for the following payments: (1) 100.0 million in exchange for 3.81 of the Royalty, which increases to 6.67 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, (2) 100.0 million in exchange for 3.81 of the Royalty, which increases to 6.67 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, and (3) 50.0 million in exchange for 1.90 of the Royalty, which increases to 3.33 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, in each case less Royalty payments received by us with respect to the Assigned

Research and development expense Research and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our research activities, as well as the costs associated with our drug discovery efforts, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings. Our research and development expenses consist of: external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract research organizations and investigative sites, third-party manufacturing organizations and consultants;
 employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits, including share-based compensation, for the personnel involved in our drug discovery and development activities; and
 facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, IT, human resources and other support functions, depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment, and laboratory and other supplies.
 
 We use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects, including our drug development programs. We track expenses related to our clinical programs and certain preclinical programs on a per project basis. We expect our research and development expenses to fluctuate in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly in connection with Study 041 and other studies for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, our activities under our splicing and ferroptosis and inflammation programs and performance of our post-marketing requirements imposed by regulatory agencies with respect to our products. The timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the outcome of our ongoing clinical trials and the costs associated with our planned clinical trials. The timing and amount of these expenses will also depend on the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our products or product candidates and the related expansion of our research and development organization, regulatory requirements, advancement of our preclinical programs, and product and product candidate manufacturing costs. The following tables provides research and development expense for our most advanced principal product development programs, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in milestone expenses primarily related to the achievement of a 25.0 million regulatory milestone for the decision to submit an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for PKU in July 2024 and the achievement of a 25.0 million regulatory milestone for the acceptance of an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for PKU in September 2024, as compared to no milestones achieved in the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in milestone expenses primarily related to the achievement of a 15.0 million success-based regulatory milestone for the validation and acceptance of an MMA for sepiapterin for PKU in May 2024, the achievement of a 25.0 million regulatory milestone for the decision to submit an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for PKU in July 2024, and the achievement of a 25.0 million regulatory milestone for the acceptance of an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for PKU in September 2024, as compared to the achievement of a 30.0 million success-based development milestone for the completion of enrollment of a Phase 3 clinical trial for sepiapterin for PKU in February 2023. Payroll, benefits, and share-based stock compensation. Consists of costs incurred for salaries and wages, bonus, payroll taxes, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with employees involved in research and development activities. Stock-based compensation may fluctuate from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates stock-based grants are issued. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in payroll, benefits, and share-based stock compensation expenses primarily relates to our reduction in workforce in connection with our strategic pipeline prioritization and discontinuation of our preclinical and early research programs in our gene therapy platform. Facilities and other. Consists of indirect costs incurred for the benefit of multiple programs, including information technology, and other facility-based expenses, such as rent expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in facilities and other expenses primarily related to decreases in facility-based expenses at our facility in Hopewell Township, New Jersey as a result of an amendment and restatement of our lease for such facility. The successful development of our products and product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of: the scope, rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;

 the potential benefits of our products and product candidates over other therapies; our ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our products or product candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future, including our ability to negotiate pricing and reimbursement terms acceptable to us; clinical trial results; the terms and timing of regulatory approvals; and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our products or product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of those products or product candidates. For example, if the EMA or FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of any of our products or product candidates or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Selling, general and administrative expense Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expenses, in our executive, legal, business development, commercial, finance, accounting, information technology and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense; advertising and promotional expenses; costs associated with industry and trade shows; and professional fees for legal services, including patent-related expenses, accounting services and miscellaneous selling costs. We expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods in connection with our continued efforts to commercialize our products, including increased payroll, expanded infrastructure, commercial operations, increased consulting, legal, accounting and investor relations expenses. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net consists of interest expense from the liability for the sale of future royalties related to the Original Royalty Purchase Agreement, the A R Royalty Purchase Agreement, the 2026 Convertible Notes outstanding, the Blackstone Credit Agreement that we repaid and terminated in October 2023, offset by interest income earned on investments. Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies as reported in our 2023 Annual Report.

The decrease in net product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in net product sales of Emflaza, offset by an increase in net product sales of Translarna. Emflaza net product revenues were 51.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 15.5 million, or 23 , compared to 67.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These results were driven by the expiration of Emflaza s orphan drug exclusivity in February 2024. Translarna net product revenues were 72.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.3 million, or 5 , compared to 69.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Royalty revenue was 61.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.2 million, or 22 , from 50.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in royalty revenue was due to higher Evrysdi sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. In accordance with the SMA License Agreement, we are entitled to royalties on worldwide annual net sales of the product. Manufacturing revenue. Manufacturing revenues were 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.4 million, or 100 , from 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to no manufacturing services related to the production of plasmid DNA and AAV vectors for gene therapy applications for external customers being performed in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. In June 2024, we sold our gene therapy manufacturing business in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. Accordingly, we do not expect to have manufacturing revenue going forward. Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets . Cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets were 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.4 million, or 14 , from 9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of product sales consisted primarily of royalty payments associated with Emflaza, Translarna, and Upstaza net product sales, costs associated with Emflaza, Translarna, and Upstaza products sold during the period, and royalty expense related to royalty revenues and collaboration milestone revenues. The increase in cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible asset, was primarily due to increases in royalty costs driven by Emflaza. As of February 2024, the Emflaza rights intangible

These amounts are related to the Emflaza rights acquisition, as well as the Waylivra, Tegsedi, and Upstaza intangible assets, which are all being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The amortization decrease was driven by the Emflaza rights intangible asset being fully amortized as of February 2024, therefore, milestones are recorded on the consolidated statement of operations within cost of product sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets from February 2024 onward. Research and development expense. Research and development expense was 161.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.8 million, or 2 , from 164.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses reflected strategic portfolio prioritization as we continued to focus our resources on our differentiated, high potential research and development programs. Research and development expense also included a total of 50.0 million regulatory success-based milestones payable to the former Censa securityholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to no expenses related to milestones achieved in the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease reflected lower employee costs as a result of the reduction in workforce in 2023. Change in the fair value of contingent consideration. The change in the fair value of contingent consideration was a loss of 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.8 million, or 53 , from a loss of 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was related to the fair valuation of the potential future consideration to be paid to former equityholders of Agilis as a result of our merger with Agilis which closed in August 2018. Changes in the fair value were due to the re-calculation of discounted cash flows for the passage of time and changes to certain other estimated assumptions. Tangible asset impairment and losses (gains) on transactions, net. Tangible asset impairment and losses (gains) on transactions, net was 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.8 million, or 100 , from 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 
 September 30, 2023. The change in income tax (expense) benefit was attributable to the recognition of the revenue associated with the Royalty Pharma agreement of 2023. Additionally, we incur income tax expenses in various foreign jurisdictions, and our foreign tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of pre-tax earnings among these different jurisdictions. Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 The following table summarizes revenues and selected expense and other income data for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The change was primarily related to our strategic portfolio prioritization and decision to discontinue our preclinical and early research programs in our gene therapy platform, which included Friedreich ataxia and Angelman syndrome, which was announced in May 2023. As a result, we fully impaired the Friedreich ataxia and Angelman syndrome intangible assets and determined that the fair value for all of the contingent consideration payable related to Friedreich ataxia and Angelman syndrome was 0. As a result, we recorded a fair value change of 129.8 million for the contingent consideration related to Friedreich ataxia and Angelman syndrome during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 
 related to the sale of certain assets for gene therapy manufacturing, and a 1.5 million loss primarily related to fixed asset impairments in connection with the South Plainfield, New Jersey office closure in August 2024. These amounts were partially offset by a gain of 2.2 million on lease terminations and a 0.1 million gain on sales of fixed assets. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net was 125.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 41.0 million, or 48 , from 84.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

These expenses were offset by unrealized gains of 5.5 million on marketable securities equity investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax (expense) benefit. Income tax expense was 29.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a change of 97.2 million, or over 100 , compared to income tax benefit of 68.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in income tax expense (benefit) was attributable to the recognition of the revenue associated with the Royalty Pharma agreement of 2023. Additionally, we incur income tax expenses in various foreign jurisdictions, and our foreign tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of pre-tax earnings among these different jurisdictions. Liquidity and capital resources Sources of liquidity Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As a growing commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, we are engaging in significant commercialization efforts for our products while also devoting a substantial portion of our efforts on research and development related to our products, product candidates and other programs. To date, our product revenue has primarily consisted of sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States and from Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States. Our ongoing ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is dependent upon our ability to maintain our marketing authorizations in Brazil, Russia and in the EEA and secure market access through commercial programs following the conclusion of pricing and reimbursement terms at sustainable levels in the member states of the EEA or through EAP programs or similar styled programs in the EEA and other territories. In January 2024, the CHMP issued a negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure. In May 2024, the EC decided not to adopt the CHMP s negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna and returned such opinion to the CHMP for re-evaluation. In June 2024, following the EC s request for re-review, the CHMP issued a negative opinion on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. On October 18, 2024, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following the requested reexamination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the opinion will be reviewed by the EC which is expected to decide on opinion adoption approximately 67 days from the date of issuance. If the EC adopts the negative opinion, Translarna would no longer have marketing authorization in the member states of the EEA. The marketing authorization for Translarna remains in effect, pending the EC s potential adoption of the negative opinion. Based on the timeline of these procedures, we expect the marketing authorization for Translarna to remain in effect approximately through the end of 2024. We are exploring other potential mechanisms by which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA if the negative opinion is adopted by the EC. Emflaza is approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients two years and older.

 Our ability to generate product revenue from Emflaza will largely depend on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Additionally, Emflaza s seven-year period of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older expired in February 2024. We have previously relied on this exclusivity period to commercialize Emflaza in the United States. We expect the expiration of this orphan drug exclusivity to have a significant negative impact on Emflaza net product revenue. Emflaza s orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients two years of age to less than five expires in June 2026. We have historically financed our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock in public offerings, our at the market offering of our common stock, proceeds from the A R Royalty Purchase Agreement, the private placements of our preferred stock, collaborations, bank and institutional lender debt, private offerings of convertible senior notes and convertible debt financings and grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next fiscal year. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. In August 2019, we entered into the Sales Agreement, pursuant to which, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 125.0 million from time to time through the Sales Agents by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Corporate Updates Funding for additional information. In September 2019, we closed a private offering of 287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50 convertible senior notes due 2026 including the full exercise by the initial purchasers of an option to purchase an additional 37.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes. The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 1.50 per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. We received net proceeds of 279.3 million after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us. In October 2022, we entered into the Blackstone Credit Agreement for fundings of up to 950.0 million consisting of a committed loan facility funded on the Closing Date, in the aggregate principal amount of 300.0 million, and a delayed draw term loan facility of up to 150.0 million to be funded at our request within 18 months of the Closing Date subject to specified conditions, and further contemplating the potential for up to 500.0 million of additional financing, to the extent that we request such additional financing and subject to the Lenders agreement to provide such additional financing and to mutual agreement on terms. In October 2023, we terminated the Blackstone Credit Agreement. All liens and security interests securing the loans made pursuant to the Blackstone Credit Agreement were released upon termination. We have received fundings from Royalty Pharma under the A R Royalty Purchase Agreement in July 2020, October 2023 and June 2024 totaling 1.9 billion (less Royalty payments received by us with respect to the Assigned Royalty Rights). In exchange for these fundings, we sold Royalty Pharma 90.49 of the Royalty, which will be reduced to 83.33 after Royalty Pharma receives 1.3 billion in aggregate payments, or the Assigned Royalty Cap, from the Royalty assigned under the Original Royalty Purchase Agreement. We currently retain 9.51 of the Royalty, which increases to 16.67 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met. We have the option to sell our retained portions of the Royalty to Royalty Pharma in up to three tranches for the following payments: (1) 100.0 million in exchange for 3.81 of the Royalty, which increases to 6.67 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, (2) 100.0 million in exchange for 3.81 of the Royalty, which increases to 6.67 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, and (3) 50.0 million in exchange for 1.90 of the Royalty, which increases to 3.33 after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, in each case less Royalty payments received by us with respect to the Assigned Royalty Rights. The A R Royalty Purchase Agreement includes specified negative and affirmative covenants with respect to our rights under the SMA License Agreement as well as other customary representations and warranties, covenants and other provisions. The A R Royalty Purchase Agreement will terminate 60 days following the date on which Roche is no longer obligated to make any payments of the Royalty pursuant to the SMA License Agreement.

 Cash flows As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 1.01 billion. The following table provides information regarding our cash flows and our capital expenditures for the periods indicated. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (77,684) (58,130) Investing activities (223,530) (82,319) Financing activities 229,395 25,915 Net cash used in operating activities was 77.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 58.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily related to spend supporting clinical development and commercial activities, partially offset by the cash received from the sales milestone of 100.0 million for the achievement of 1.5 billion in worldwide net sales from Evrysdi. The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to supporting clinical development and commercial activities. Net cash used in investing activities was 223.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 82.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily related to the acquisition of product rights, purchases of marketable securities, and purchases of fixed assets , partially offset by net sales and redemption of marketable securities, proceeds from sales of fixed assets and proceeds from principal payment of the ClearPoint convertible debt security . Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to the acquisition of product rights, purchases of marketable securities-equity investments, and purchases of fixed assets, partially offset by net sales and redemption of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was 229.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 25.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to proceeds from sales of future royalties, proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan, and proceeds from the exercise of options, partially offset by payments on our finance lease principal and payments on contingent consideration. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to cash received from the exercise of options, and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by payments on our finance lease principal and debt issuance costs related to the senior secured term loan . Funding requirements We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our commercialization efforts in the United States, the EEA, Latin America and other territories, including expenses related to our commercial infrastructure and corresponding sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, and distribution and manufacturing undertakings as well as administrative and employee-based expenses. In addition to the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with ongoing, planned and potential future clinical trials and studies for sepiapterin and our splicing and ferroptosis and inflammation programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications. We continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories that we do not currently have marketing authorization in . Additionally, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD following the request for re-examination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the opinion will be reviewed by the EC, which is expected to decide on opinion adoption approximately 67 days from the date of issuance. We are exploring other potential mechanisms by which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA if the negative opinion is adopted by the EC. In March 2024, we submitted a BLA to the FDA for our gene therapy for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States. In May 2024, the FDA 

 59 

Table of Contents 
 accepted the filing of the BLA and granted priority review with a target regulatory action date of November 13, 2024. Also in March 2024, we submitted an MAA to the EMA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU, which was validated and accepted for review by the EMA in May 2024. In July 2024, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU. I n September 2024, the FDA accepted for filing the NDA, with a target regulatory action date of July 29, 2025. These efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization and manufacturing expenses. In addition, our expenses will increase if and as we: seek to satisfy contractual and regulatory obligations that we assumed through our acquisitions and collaborations; execute our commercialization strategy for our products, including initial commercialization launches of our products, label extensions or entering new markets; are required to complete any additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, assessments or analyses in order to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States or elsewhere; are required to take other steps to maintain our current marketing authorization in the EEA, Brazil and Russia for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or to obtain further marketing authorizations for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or other indications; initiate or continue the research and development of sepiapterin and our splicing and ferroptosis and inflammation programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications; seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; seek to expand and diversify our product pipeline through strategic transactions; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts. 
 We believe that our cash flows from product sales, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: our ability to maintain our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA following the CHMP s negative opinion on the conditional marketing authorization and the EC s potential adoption of the negative opinion or identify other potential mechanisms by which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA; our ability to maintain the marketing authorization for Translarna and our other products in territories outside of the EEA; 

 60 

Table of Contents 
 our ability to commercialize and market our products and product candidates that may receive marketing authorization; our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement terms, on a timely basis, with third-party payors for our products and products candidates; the amount of generic drug competition that we face for Emflaza following its loss of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older; our ability to obtain marketing authorization for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in the United States and EEA; our ability to obtain marketing authorization for our gene therapy for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States; the costs, timing and outcome of our efforts to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States, including, whether we will be required to perform additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or CMC assessments or analyses at significant cost which, if successful, may support approval of Translarna for nmDMD in the United States; unexpected decreases in revenue or increase in expenses resulting from potential widespread outbreaks of contagious disease, such as COVID-19; our ability to successfully complete all post-marketing requirements imposed by regulatory agencies with respect to our products; the progress and results of activities for sepiapterin and our splicing and ferroptosis and inflammation programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications; the scope, costs and timing of our commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, legal, regulatory, distribution and manufacturing, for any of our products and for any of our other product candidates that may receive marketing authorization or any additional territories in which we receive authorization to market Translarna; the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of sepiapterin and our splicing and ferroptosis and inflammation programs and Translarna and Upstaza in other territories; our ability to satisfy our obligations under the indenture governing the 2026 Convertible Notes; the timing and scope of any potential future growth in our employee base; the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates, including those in our splicing and ferroptosis and inflammation programs; revenue received from commercial sales of our products or any of our product candidates; our ability to obtain additional and maintain existing reimbursed named patient and cohort EAP programs for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD on adequate terms, or at all; the ability and willingness of patients and healthcare professionals to access Translarna through alternative means if pricing and reimbursement negotiations in the applicable territory do not have a positive outcome; 

 61 

Table of Contents 
 our ability to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our lease agreements; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims; the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products, product candidates, and technologies, including the success of any acquisition, in-licensing or other strategic transaction we may pursue, and the costs of subsequent development requirements and commercialization efforts, including with respect to our acquisitions of Emflaza, Agilis, our ferroptosis and inflammation platform and Censa and our licensing of Tegsedi and Waylivra; and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, including our collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation, and our ability to obtain research funding and achieve milestones under these agreements. 
 With respect to our outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which will require total funding of 4.3 million annually. In March 2024, we submitted a BLA to the FDA for our gene therapy for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States. Pursuant to the Censa Merger Agreement, the acceptance triggered a 15.0 million regulatory milestone to the former Censa securityholders, which was recorded in research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the 15.0 million milestone was paid. In July 2024, we announced the submission of an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with PKU, including the full spectrum of ages and disease subtypes. Pursuant to the Censa Merger Agreement, the decision to submit the NDA triggered a 25.0 million regulatory milestone to the former Censa securityholders. In September 2024, we announced the FDA acceptance for filing of the NDA. Pursuant to the Censa Merger Agreement, the acceptance triggered a 25.0 million regulatory milestone to the former Censa securityholders. Together, the 50.0 million of regulatory milestones were recorded in research and development expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and are recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 . In March 2024, we submitted a BLA to the FDA for our gene therapy for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States. In May 2024, the FDA accepted the filing for the BLA and granted priority review with a target regulatory action date of November 13, 2024. As a result of the acceptance, we paid a 20.0 million milestone payment to former equity holders of Agilis, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining potential regulatory milestones we expect to achieve is 11.1 million, and the remaining potential sales milestones we expect to achieve is 50.0 million, both of which relate solely to Upstaza. We also have certain significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments that require funding and we have disclosed these items under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Funding Obligations in our 2023 Annual Report. There were no material changes to these obligations and commitments during the period ended September 30, 2024. We have never been profitable and we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never do so. We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product and product candidates and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to 

 62 

Table of Contents 
 relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity, debt or other financings when needed or on attractive terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. During the period ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our market risk or how our market risk is managed, compared to those disclosed under the heading Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our 2023 Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures , as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to claims, legal proceedings and disputes, including as a result of patients seeking to participate in our clinical trials or otherwise gain access to our product candidates. We are not currently aware of any material legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is subject. Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have set forth in Item 1A to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, risk factors relating to our business, our industry, our structure and our common stock. Readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are referred to such Item 1A for a more complete understanding of risks concerning us.

 Item 5. Other Information. On November 5, 2024, William F. Bell, Jr., a member of the Company s board of directors (the Board ), notified the Company of his resignation from the Board and the Compensation Committee thereof, effective as of November 7, 2024. Mr. Bell has informed the Company that his decision is based on his need to focus on other commitments and was not due to any disagreement with the Company. Director and Officer Trading Arrangements A portion of the compensation of our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) is in the form of equity awards and, from time to time, directors and officers engage in open-market transactions with respect to the securities acquired pursuant to such equity awards or other Company securities, including to satisfy tax withholding obligations when equity awards vest or are exercised, and for diversification or other personal reasons. Transactions in Company securities by directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our insider trading policy, which requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in Company securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information. The following table describes, for the quarterly period covered by this report, each trading arrangement for the sale or purchase of Company securities or by our directors and officers that is either (1) a contract, instruction or written plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c), or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement , or (2) a trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K): ) Adoption ) trading arrangement Sale Until , or such earlier date upon which all transactions are completed.
