of net assets that accrues daily and pays monthly. Prior to February 21, 2024, the Sponsor Fee was of net assets.
Effective for the period from March 12, 2024, through March 31, 2025, the Sponsor agreed to waive the entire Sponsor Fee for the first
 billion of the Trust s net assets. If the Trust s net assets exceed 1.5 billion prior to March 31, 2025, the Sponsor
Fee charged on net assets over 1.5 billion will be 0.20 of net assets. All investors will incur the same Sponsor Fee which is the weighted
average of those fee rates. After March 31, 2025, the Sponsor Fee will be 0.20 of net assets. The Sponsor has agreed to pay all operating
expenses (except for litigation expenses and other extraordinary expenses) out of the Sponsor Fee. The Sponsor from time to time will
sell bitcoin, which may be facilitated by one or more liquidity providers and/or the Bitcoin Custodian, in such quantity as is necessary
to permit payment of the Sponsor Fee and Trust expenses and liabilities not assumed by the Sponsor. 

The Trustee fee is paid by the Sponsor and is not a
separate expense of the Trust. 

The Trust holds its bitcoin at the Bitcoin Custodian
and may also hold bitcoin at the Additional Bitcoin Custodian, both of which are regulated third-party custodians that carry insurance
(in the case of the Additional Bitcoin Custodian, such insurance is carried by its parent, Coinbase Inc., and is intended to cover the
loss of client assets held by Coinbase Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the Additional Bitcoin Custodian) and are responsible for
safekeeping of bitcoin owned by the Trust and holding private keys that provide access to the bitcoin in the Trust s bitcoin account. 

State Street Bank and Trust Company serves as the Trust s
administrator, transfer agent and cash custodian. 

of net assets. 

VanEck is a minority interest holder in the parent
company of the Bitcoin Custodian, representing less than of its equity. 

Shares to authorized participants. Prior to March 4, 2024, the Trust offered baskets consisting of Shares
to authorized participants. Authorized participants pay a transaction fee for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets.
The Administrator calculates the cost to purchase (or sell in the case of a redemption order) the amount of bitcoin represented by the
baskets being created (or redeemed); the amount of bitcoin represented is equal to the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in
the baskets being created (or redeemed). 

The Trust creates and redeems Shares, but only in one
or more baskets. Baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of bitcoin
represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount which is equal to the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in
the baskets being

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

This information should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes to financial statements included with this report. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements
that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology
such as may, will, should, could, expect, plan, 
 anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or the
negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in
this report that address activities, events or developments that may occur in the future, including such matters as changes in
commodity prices and market conditions (for bitcoin and the Shares), the operations of the Trust, the plans of the Sponsor and
references to the Trust s future success and other similar matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are only
predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses made
by the Sponsor on the basis of its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well
as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform
to the Sponsor s expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations
discussed in this Report, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning
taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Consequently,
all the forward-looking statements made in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance
that the actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, will result
in the expected consequences to, or have the expected effects on, the Trust s operations or the value of the Shares issued
by the Trust. Moreover, neither the Sponsor nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the
forward-looking statements. Neither the Trust nor the Sponsor undertakes an obligation to publicly update or conform to actual
results any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required
by law. 

Introduction 

The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust does not
have directors, officers or employees. The creation and operation of the Trust has been arranged by the Sponsor. The Trust is administered
by the Trust Agreement, among the Sponsor, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee. The Trust is managed and controlled by the Sponsor,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of VanEck. The Sponsor is not governed by a board of directors. 

The Trust s investment objective is to reflect the performance
of bitcoin less the operating expenses of the Trust. The Trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to pursue any
investment strategy beyond tracking the price of bitcoin. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit
from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of bitcoin. 

The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in aggregations of
25,000 Shares, a Basket, or integral multiples thereof, and only in transactions with Authorized Participants. 

Shares of the Trust trade on the Exchange under the ticker symbol
 HODL. 

Computation of Net Asset Value 

The Trust s NAV is calculated based on the Trust s
net asset holdings as reconciled to the Bitcoin Custodians accounts on a market approach, determined on a daily basis in
accordance with the MarketVector TM Bitcoin Benchmark Rate price at 4:00 p.m. EST. The Trust s NAV per Share is
calculated by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities, and then dividing that total by
the total number of outstanding Shares. The Trust Agreement gives the Sponsor the exclusive authority to determine the Trust s
NAV and the Trust s NAV per Share, which it has delegated to the Administrator. 

10 

Liquidity 

The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or
events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for a fee, the Sponsor has
agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period
covered by this report was the Sponsor s Fee. The Trust s only source of liquidity is its sales of bitcoin. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), management makes estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, as well as the reported amount of revenue and expenses reported during the period. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. A description of the valuation of bitcoin, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important
to understanding its results of operations and financial position, is provided in the section entitled Computation of Net
Asset Value above. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements included in this report for further discussion
of the Trust s accounting policies. 

Results of Operations 

The Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 

The Trust s NAV increased from 614,747,718 at June 30,
2024 to 759,376,653 at September 30, 2024, a 24 increase. The increase in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily
from the number of outstanding shares increasing from 8,775,000 Shares at June 30, 2024 to 10,600,000 Shares at September 30, 2024.
This is the net result of 3,150,000 Shares (126 Baskets) being created and 1,325,000 Shares (53 Baskets) being redeemed during
the period. In addition, the price of bitcoin grew 2.26 from 61,926 at June 30, 2024 to 63,326 at September 30, 2024. 

The 2.26 increase in the NAV per Share from 70.06 at June
30, 2024 to 71.64 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 2.26 increase in the price of bitcoin during this period. 

The NAV per Share of 76.75 on July 22, 2024, was the highest
during the quarter, compared with a low during the quarter of 60.09 on August 5, 2024. 

Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the
quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 15,911,468 resulting from a net unrealized appreciation on investment in bitcoin of 11,414,566,
a net realized gain of 4,496,902 on bitcoin sold for the redemption of Shares and a net investment income of 0. The Trust had
no expenses during the quarter as they were all waived by the Sponsor. 

The Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 

The Trust s net asset value increased from 100,000 at
December 31, 2023 to 759,376,653 at September 30, 2024, a 759,277 increase. The increase in the Trust s net asset value
resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding shares, which increased from 2,000 Shares at December 31, 2023
to 10,600,000 Shares at September 30, 2024. This is the net result of 12,900,000 Shares (438 Baskets) being created and 2,302,000
Shares (90 Baskets) being redeemed during the period, and an increase in the price of bitcoin, which grew 43.33 from 44,182 at
January 4, 2024 to 63,326 at September 30, 2024. 

The 43.28 increase in the NAV per Share from 50.00 at December
31, 2023 to 71.64 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 43.33 increase in the price of bitcoin during this period. 

The NAV per Share of 82.73 on March 13, 2024, was the highest
during the period, compared with a low during the period of 44.40 on January 23, 2024. 

Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 38,425,905, resulting from an net unrealized appreciation on investment in bitcoin
of 24,957,145, a net realized gain of 13,521,354 on bitcoin sold for the redemption of Shares, a net realized gain of 10,977
from bitcoin sold to pay expenses during the nine-month period, and a net investment loss of 63,571. Other than the Sponsor Fee
of 63,571, the Trust had no other expenses during the nine-month period. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

The duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions

officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of 

11 

the period covered by this report to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules
and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent
to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There are inherent limitations
to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of the controls and procedures.
