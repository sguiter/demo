Proportionate adjustments were made to the exercise prices and the number of shares underlying the Company s outstanding equity awards, as applicable, as well as to the number of shares issuable under the Company s equity incentive plans and conversion of the Company s outstanding convertible securities. The common stock issued pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split will remain fully paid and non-assessable.

 DBMG's remaining unsatisfied performance obligations increase with awards of new contracts and decrease as it performs work and recognizes revenue on existing contracts. DBMG includes a project within its remaining unsatisfied performance obligations at such time the project is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. DBMG's remaining unsatisfied performance obligations include amounts related to contracts for which a fixed price contract value is not assigned when a reasonable estimate of total transaction price can be made.

million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and income tax expense was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company's income tax expense primarily relates to expense as calculated under ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740") for taxpaying entities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the annual effective tax rate calculation for the interim tax provision included the tax expense associated with the INNOVATE U.S. consolidated group due to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act's 80 limitation on net operating losses incurred after 2017. Additionally, the tax benefits associated with losses generated by certain other businesses have been reduced by a full valuation allowance as management does not believe it is more-likely-than-not that the losses will be utilized. The annual effective tax rate calculated for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 interim tax provisions included an unrepeated million tax benefit, consisting of a current tax expense of million related to a foreign tax payment and a deferred tax benefit of million related to the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the million put option, both of which were related to the sale of New Saxon's investment in HMN on March 6, 2023. Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the tax benefits associated with losses generated by the INNOVATE U.S. consolidated group and certain other businesses have been reduced by a full valuation allowance as management does not believe it is more-likely-than-not that the losses will be utilized. 
 
 Net Operating Losses 
 
 At December 31, 2023, the Company had gross U.S. net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income of the U.S. consolidated group in the amount of million. The Company expects that approximately million of the gross U.S. net operating loss carryforwards would be available to offset taxable income in 2024 and later periods. Subsequent to the quarter, the 2023 U.S. Consolidated tax return was filed, which resulted in an additional million of net operating losses that would be available to offset taxable income in 2024 and later periods. The amount of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards reflected in the financial statements differ from the amounts reported on the U.S. tax return due to uncertain tax positions related to tax laws and regulations that are subject to varied interpretation by the IRS. 
 
 Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, the Company had million of gross U.S. net operating loss carryforwards from its subsidiaries that do not qualify to be included in the INNOVATE U.S. consolidated income tax return, including million from R2 Technologies, million from DTV America, and other entities of million. Of the million of gross U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, million was generated after 2017 and will have an indefinite carryforward period; the remaining million was generated prior to 2018 and will expire, if unused, by 2037. 
 
 Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
 
 The Company follows the provision of ASC 740 which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company is subject to challenge from various taxing authorities relative to certain tax planning strategies, including certain intercompany transactions as well as regulatory taxes . 
 
 The Company did have any unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to uncertain tax positions that would impact the effective income tax rate if recognized. The Company has reduced the net operating loss carryforward by million for uncertain tax positions based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations that are subject to varied interpretation by the IRS. 
 
 Examinations 
 
 The Company conducts business globally, and as a result, INNOVATE or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Tax years 2002-2023 remain open for examination. 
 
 The Company is currently under examination in various domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. The open tax years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the applicability of income tax credits for the relevant tax period. Given the nature of tax audits, there is a risk that disputes may arise.

Plaintiffs principally allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and/or aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duty by participating in a scheme in which the INNOVATE Entities (i) acquired majority voting and operating control over DTV; (ii) exploited that control to misappropriate DTV s assets and business opportunities for the benefit of the INNOVATE Entities; and (iii) purchased DTV stock at a discount to fair value and diminished the value of DTV stock options. Plaintiffs allege that the Individual Defendants (i) prompted the INNOVATE Entities to purchase more than low-power television LPTV broadcast stations originally identified for potential acquisition by DTV, (ii) allowed the INNOVATE Entities to misappropriate DTV technology, known as DTV Cast, (iii) caused DTV to transfer unspecified LPTV broadcasting station licenses to INNOVATE affiliates without paying any value, and (iv) transferred to the INNOVATE Entities unspecified DTV broadcasting stations that had been repacked by the FCC. Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint on May 19, 2021. On June 23, 2021, plaintiffs amended their complaint. In the amended complaint, plaintiffs assert the same claims they asserted in their initial complaint, added a claim for waste associated with DTV s purported transfer of licenses and construction permits for less than fair value, and dropped Paul Robinson as a defendant. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety on August 25, 2021, and the parties completed briefing on the motions to dismiss on November 10, 2021. The Court heard argument on the motions to dismiss on March 29, 2022. On June 28, 2022, the Court requested that the parties submit supplemental briefing on the motions to dismiss by July 20, 2022.

Fourth, the Court dismissed claims associated with the INNOVATE Entities purported purchases of unidentified broadcasting stations. Fifth, the Court dismissed all claims challenging the Expense Sharing Agreement, and the Right to Use Agreement between INNOVATE and DTV, and certain Stock-Based Compensation Agreements. Sixth, the Court dismissed the aiding and abetting claim against the INNOVATE Entities. Seventh, the Court dismissed the civil conspiracy claim as to all defendants. Lastly, the Court dismissed the option-holders claim for tortious interference with prospective business opportunities. Thus, after the Court issued its October 28, 2022 Memorandum Opinion, the only claims to survive Defendants motion to dismiss are (i) a derivative claim against the INNOVATE Entities (other than Continental General), Levi, and Falcone for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the million Frank Digital acquisition; (ii) a derivative claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the INNOVATE Entities (other than Continental General), in their capacities as DTV s controlling stockholders, relating to the sale of licenses (for less than million) in connection with the Gray Media sale (the "Gray Media Claim"); (iii) a derivative claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the INNOVATE Entities (other than Continental General) and Levi in connection with the transfer of licenses ultimately sold to TV-49 for million; and (iv) a derivative claim for waste against Levi and Falcone in connection with the sale of stations to Lowcountry, which Lowcountry later sold for million and million, respectively.

 Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement 
 
 On March 8, 2024, the Company commenced a million rights offering ("Rights Offering") for its common stock. Pursuant to the Rights Offering, the Company distributed to each holder of the Company s common stock, Series A-3 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, Series A-4 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock and the 2026 Convertible Notes as of March 6, 2024 (the rights offering record date ), transferable subscription rights to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at a price of per whole share (on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis). 
 
 Per the concurrent investment agreement entered into with Lancer Capital (the "Investment Agreement"), the Rights Offering was backstopped by Lancer Capital, an investment fund led by Avram A. Glazer, the Chairman of the Board and the Company s largest stockholder. Due to limitations on the common stock that can be issued to Lancer Capital under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), in lieu of exercising its subscription rights, pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Lancer Capital would purchase up to million of the Company s newly issued Series C Non-Voting Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series C Preferred Stock ), for an issue price of per share. In connection with the backstop commitment, and as a result of limitations in the amount common equity that can be raised under the Company s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, Lancer Capital also agreed to purchase an additional million of Series C Preferred Stock in a private placement transaction ("Concurrent Private Placement") which was to close concurrently with the settlement of the Rights Offering. Lancer Capital did not receive any compensation or other consideration for entering into or consummating the Investment Agreement. 
 
 As the Rights Offering had not yet settled by March 28, 2024, in accordance with the Investment Agreement, Lancer Capital purchased million of Series C Preferred Stock, referred to as the "equity advance." On April 24, 2024, the Company completed and closed on the Rights Offering and issued a total of shares of common stock shares of common stock on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis) for million. Based on the number of shares of common stock actually sold upon exercise of the rights to third party investors, there were excess shares of Series C Preferred Stock purchased by Lancer Capital under the equity advance that the Company was required to redeem, and Lancer Capital purchased an additional approximately Series C Preferred Stock for million under the backstop commitment. In total, the Company received million in aggregate gross proceeds related to the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement and incurred million in dealer manager fees and other related costs which have been capitalized into Additional paid in capital ("APIC"). INNOVATE has been utilizing and expects to continue to use the net proceeds from the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement for general corporate purposes, including debt service and working capital. In addition, as a result of the closing of the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement, a mandatory prepayment was required on the CGIC Unsecured Note, and consequently, on April 26, 2024, INNOVATE redeemed million of the CGIC Unsecured Note. 
 
 Under the rules of the NYSE, because the shares purchased by Lancer Capital were greater than 20 of the Company's common stock outstanding before the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock, those shares of Series C Preferred Stock were not allowed to be converted until stockholder approval of such issuance was obtained. On June 18, 2024, the Company held its annual shareholder meeting where Company's shareholder's approved the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. As a result, approximately shares of Series C Preferred Stock, which were held by Lancer Capital, were converted into shares of common stock shares of common stock on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis).

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated annual audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024 (the "2023 Annual Report") and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the "Risk Factors" section in our 2023 Annual Report as well as the section below entitled "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, "INNOVATE" means INNOVATE Corp. and the "Company," "we" and "our" mean INNOVATE together with its consolidated subsidiaries. "U.S. GAAP" means accounting principles accepted in the United States of America. 

Our Business and Our Operations 
 
 We are a diversified holding company with principal operations conducted through three operating platforms or reportable segments: Infrastructure ("DBMG"), Life Sciences ("Pansend"), and Spectrum, plus our Other segment, which includes businesses that do not meet the separately reportable segment thresholds. 
 
 For additional information on our business, refer to Note 1. Organization and Business to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Cyclical Patterns 
 
 Our segments' operations can be highly cyclical. Our volume of business in our Infrastructure segment may be adversely affected by declines or delays in projects, which may vary by geographic region. Project schedules, particularly in connection with large, complex, and longer-term projects can also create fluctuations in the services provided, which may adversely affect us in any given period. 
 
 For example, in connection with larger, more complicated projects, the timing of obtaining permits and other approvals may be delayed, and we may need to maintain a portion of our workforce and equipment in an underutilized capacity to ensure we are strategically positioned to deliver on such projects when they move forward. 
 
 Examples of other items that may cause our results or demand for our services to fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter include: weather or project site conditions; financial condition of our customers and their access to capital; margins of projects performed during any particular period; rising interest rates and inflation; and economic, political and market conditions on a regional, national or global scale. 
 
 Accordingly, our operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period. 

Recent Developments 
 
 We continually evaluate strategic and business alternatives within our operating segments, which may include the following: operating, growing or acquiring additional assets or businesses related to current or historical operations; or winding down or selling our existing operations. In the longer-term, we may evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses unrelated to our current or historical operations. In the event we were to enter into a strategic transaction to sell any of our existing operations, our intention is to use available proceeds from such transaction to address our capital structure at our Non-Operating Corporate and Spectrum segments. 
 
 In 2024, including subsequent to the third quarter end, as part of our strategic process, we engaged in several transactions that had or will have an effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our business and individual segments.

Reverse Stock Split 
 
 On August 8, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock (the Reverse Stock Split following stockholder approval. The Reverse Stock Split became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. The Reverse Stock Split was implemented for the primary purpose of regaining compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing of the Company s common stock on the NYSE. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of the Company s common stock issued and outstanding were automatically reclassified and changed into one new share of the Company s common stock, with whole shares issued for fractional shares. Proportionate adjustments were made to the exercise prices and the number of shares underlying the Company s outstanding equity awards, as applicable, as well as to the number of shares issuable under the Company s equity incentive plans and conversion of the Company s outstanding convertible securities. The common stock issued pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split will remain fully paid and non-assessable. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the 0.001 par value per share of the common stock or the authorized number of shares of common stock or preferred stock. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of outstanding common shares was reduced from 130,529,931 to 13,166,057, inclusive of an additional 113,064 incremental whole shares issued for fractional shares. Unless noted, all common shares and per share amounts of common stock, options and restricted stock and any associated debt or preferred stock conversion rates contained in the historical periods presented within this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one-for-ten Reverse Stock Split. 
 
 Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement 
 
 On March 8, 2024, the Company commenced a 19.0 million rights offering ("Rights Offering") for its common stock. Pursuant to the Rights Offering, the Company distributed to each holder of the Company s common stock, Series A-3 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, Series A-4 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock and the 2026 Convertible Notes as of March 6, 2024 (the rights offering record date ), transferable subscription rights to purchase 0.2858 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of 0.70 per whole share (on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis). 
 
 Per the concurrent investment agreement entered into with Lancer Capital (the "Investment Agreement"), the Rights Offering was backstopped by Lancer Capital, an investment fund led by Avram A. Glazer, the Chairman of the Board and the Company s largest stockholder. Due to limitations on the common stock that can be issued to Lancer Capital under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), in lieu of exercising its subscription rights, pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Lancer Capital would purchase up to 19.0 million of the Company s newly issued Series C Non-Voting Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series C Preferred Stock ), for an issue price of 1,000 per share. In connection with the backstop commitment, and as a result of limitations in the amount common equity that can be raised under the Company s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, Lancer Capital also agreed to purchase an additional 16.0 million of Series C Preferred Stock in a private placement transaction ("Concurrent Private Placement") which was to close concurrently with the settlement of the Rights Offering. Lancer Capital did not receive any compensation or other consideration for entering into or consummating the Investment Agreement. 
 
 As the Rights Offering had not yet settled by March 28, 2024, in accordance with the Investment Agreement, Lancer Capital purchased 25.0 million of Series C Preferred Stock, referred to as the "equity advance." On April 24, 2024, the Company completed and closed on the Rights Offering and issued a total of 530,611 shares of common stock (5,306,105 shares of common stock on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis) for 3.7 million. Based on the number of shares of common stock actually sold upon exercise of the rights to third party investors, there were no excess shares of Series C Preferred Stock purchased by Lancer Capital under the equity advance that the Company was required to redeem, and Lancer Capital purchased an additional approximately 6,286 Series C Preferred Stock for 6.3 million under the backstop commitment. In total, the Company received 35.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds related to the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement and incurred 1.8 million in dealer manager fees and other related costs which have been capitalized into Additional paid in capital ("APIC"). INNOVATE has been utilizing and expects to continue to use the net proceeds from the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement for general corporate purposes, including debt service and working capital. In addition, as a result of the closing of the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement, a mandatory prepayment was required on the CGIC Unsecured Note, and consequently, on April 26, 2024, INNOVATE redeemed 4.1 million of the CGIC Unsecured Note. 
 
 Under the rules of the NYSE, because the shares purchased by Lancer Capital were greater than 20 of the Company's common stock outstanding before the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock, those shares of Series C Preferred Stock were not allowed to be converted until stockholder approval of such issuance was obtained. On June 18, 2024, the Company held its annual shareholder meeting where Company's shareholder's approved the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. As a result, approximately 31,286 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, which were held by Lancer Capital, were converted into 4,469,390 shares of common stock (44,693,895 shares of common stock on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis). 
 
 The Company waived its Tax Benefits Preservation Plan to permit persons exercising rights to acquire 4.9 or more of the outstanding common stock upon the exercise thereof without becoming an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan). 
 
 INNOVATE has used and expects to continue to use the net proceeds from the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement for general corporate purposes, including debt service and for working capital. As a result of the closing of the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement, a mandatory prepayment was required on the CGIC Unsecured Note, in the amount of the greater of 3.0 million or 12.5 of the net proceeds. On April 26, 2024, INNOVATE redeemed 4.1 million of the CGIC Unsecured Note.

Stockholders Rights Agreement - Tax Benefits Preservation Plan 
 
 On May 6, 2024, the Company terminated its Tax Benefits Preservation Plan entered into on April 1, 2023 (the 2023 Preservation Plan because the Company s Board of Directors determined that the 2023 Preservation Plan was no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of the Company s ability to use its tax net operating losses and other certain tax assets. In connection with the termination of the 2023 Preservation Plan, the Company has taken routine actions to deregister the related preferred stock purchase rights under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and to delist the preferred stock purchase rights from the NYSE. These actions were administrative in nature and had no effect on the Company s common stock, which will continue to be listed on the NYSE. 
 
 Amendment to Second and Restated 2014 Omnibus Equity Award Plan and Interim CEO Equity Awards 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, prior to adoption by the Board of Directors (the "Board"), there were a total of 101,943 shares of common stock available for future award under the Company's Second Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Equity Award Plan ("Second A R 2014 Plan"). On September 30, 2024, the Board adopted, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment to the Second A R 2014 Plan to increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock, par value 0.001 per share, available for issuance thereunder to 1,300,000 (the Plan Amendment ). The Plan Amendment was approved by holders of a majority in voting power on October 4, 2024, by written consent in lieu of a special meeting, to be effective as of October 29, 2024. 
 
 Subsequent to quarter end, on October 29, 2024, when the Plan Amendment became effective, the following awards which were previously awarded to the Company's Interim CEO subject to stockholder approval of the Plan Amendment to increase the number of shares of common stock available thereunder to satisfy the settlement of the grant ("Share Approval Condition") became effective: (i) 95,322 of restricted stock unit awards ("RSU's"), which were awarded on October 11, 2023; (ii) 100,000 option awards with a strike price of 25.00 (as retroactively adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split in 2024) and an expiration date of September 15, 2033, which were awarded on September 15, 2023; (iii) 142,857 of RSUs, which were awarded on August 19, 2024; and (iv) 100,000 option awards with a strike price of 4.22 and an expiration date of September 15, 2034, which were awarded on September 15, 2024. 
 
 Debt Obligations and Financing 
 
 In addition to the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement at the Non-Operating Corporate segment discussed above, during 2024 thus far, we have refinanced some of our debt and obtained new capital financing at the subsidiary level. This financing helped us provide needed capital for our operations and the operations of our subsidiaries. 
 
 Infrastructure 
 
 On June 28, 2024, DBM and UMB entered into the Third Amendment to the UMB Credit Agreement. The amendment adds an incremental separate term loan of 25.0 million to the existing credit facility, with the same interest rate as the Revolving Line with UMB and the same maturity date as the initial 76.3 million UMB term loan. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, DBMG made 5.0 million in scheduled payments on the 4.0 note that was payable to Banker Steel's former owner. The 4.0 note matured on March 31, 2024, and was fully redeemed on April 2, 2024. 
 
 Life Sciences 
 
 R2 Technologies had various short-term notes with Lancer Capital, which expired on January 31, 2024, and, effective January 31, 2024, a new 20 note with an aggregate original principal amount of 20.0 million was issued, which was comprised of all prior outstanding principal amounts and unpaid accrued interest of 2.6 million which was capitalized into the new principal balance. Interest on the note accrued at 20 per annum and was payable monthly in arrears, in cash or, if not paid in cash, accrued and unpaid interest was capitalized monthly into the principal balance. The 20 20.0 million note also included an exit fee of 10.5 of the principal amount being repaid if repaid anytime from April 1, 2024 through April 30, 2024. The original maturity date of the 20 20.0 million note was April 30, 2024, or within five business days of the date on which R2 Technologies receives an aggregate 20.0 million from the consummation of a debt or equity financing or has a change in control, as defined in the agreement, with an optional prepayment of the entire then-outstanding and unpaid principal and accrued interest upon five-days written notice to Lancer Capital. Effective May 17, 2024, the maturity date of the note was extended to December 31, 2024, and the exit fees were amended. 
 
 The initial exit fee, as amended, as of September 30, 2024 was equal to 11.39 of the principal amount being repaid and continues to increase by 0.17 each month thereafter until maturity. Effective July 31, 2024, an additional exit fee of 1.0 million was incurred under the amendment, which increases by 1.0 million each month until the end of November 2024. If unpaid prior to maturity, the total exit fees payable will be 7.9 million. The exit fees are being amortized over the term of the note using the effective interest rate method and are included in interest expense. The exit fees are payable on the earliest of the maturity date, the date of the acceleration of the principal amount of the note for any reason or, if any portion of the note is prepaid at any time, the date of such prepayment of the note. As of September 30, 2024, total accrued exit fees were 5.6 million and were included within Accrued liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 On June 20, 2024, Pansend closed on a new Series D Preferred Stock ("Series D") investment in R2 Technologies. As part of the transaction, R2 Technologies converted 15.5 million of intercompany notes with Pansend into Series D shares. The total converted amount of 15.5 million consisted of 13.7 million in principal amount and 1.8 million of accrued interest owed to Pansend, which were eliminated in consolidation. Pansend also invested an additional 5.8 million of cash into R2 Technologies in exchange for 5.8 million of Series D shares for a total new additional investment of 21.3 million in convertible participating preferred stock, which increased Pansend's ownership in R2 Technologies to 81.4 as compared to 56.8 prior to the transaction.

 Revenue : Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 133.1 million to 242.2 million from 375.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 191.5 million to 870.5 million from 1,062.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases were driven by our Infrastructure segment, which was partially offset by increases at our Life Sciences and Spectrum segments. The decrease at our Infrastructure segment was primarily driven by the timing and size of projects, including the effect of changes in estimated costs to complete those projects recognized in the ordinary course of business, at Banker Steel and DBMG's commercial structural steel fabrication and erection business, both of which had increased activity in the comparable period on certain large commercial construction projects that are now at or near completion in the current period. This was partially offset by an increase at the industrial maintenance and repair business as a result of an increase in project work. The increase at our Life Sciences segment was attributable to R2 Technologies, primarily driven by an increase in sales in North America and worldwide of all R2's products, including Glacial fx systems, consumables, Glacial Spa systems and Glacial Rx systems. The increase at our Spectrum segment was primarily driven by network launches and expanded coverage with existing customers. 
 
 42 

Income from operations : Income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 4.8 million to 5.9 million from 10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a net decrease in gross profit of 10.5 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses of 6.4 million. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by our Infrastructure segment due to timing and size of projects that are now at or near completion in the current period, including the effect of changes in estimated costs to complete those projects recognized in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by increases at our Spectrum segment driven by network launches and expanded coverage with existing customers and at our Life Sciences segment due to an increase in systems and consumables sales at R2 Technologies. The overall decrease in SG A expenses was primarily driven by an unrepeated accounts receivable write-off of 2.2 million related to a customer bankruptcy in the comparable period and reductions in compensation-related expenses at our Infrastructure segment, unrepeated severance and reductions in compensation-related expenses at both our Non-Operating Corporate and our Spectrum segments. These decreases in SG A expenses were partially offset by an increase in SG A expenses at our Life Sciences segment, resulting from increases in selling fees paid by R2 Technologies, increased professional fees and higher sales commissions. 
 
 Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 25.0 million to 37.5 million from 12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a net increase in gross profit of 7.5 million, an increase in other operating income of 8.0 million, a decrease in SG A expenses of 6.8 million and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of 2.7 million. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by our Infrastructure segment, and, to a lesser extent, by our Spectrum and Life Sciences segments. The increase in gross profit at our Infrastructure segment was due to timing and size of projects that are now at or near completion in the current period, including the effect of changes in estimated costs to complete those projects recognized in the ordinary course of business. The net increase in other operating income was driven by our Infrastructure segment primarily as a result of a gain on a lease modification and a gain on the sale of various properties in the current period, which was partially offset by a loss on disposal related to a plant closure in the first quarter of 2024. The overall decrease in SG A was driven by unrepeated transaction expenses related to the sale of New Saxon's 19.0 investment in HMN in the comparable period, unrepeated severance and reductions in compensation-related expenses at both our Non-Operating Corporate and Spectrum segments, a decrease in consulting fees at our Non-Operating Corporate segment, a decrease in legal fees and facility-related expenses at our Infrastructure segment and decreases at our Life Sciences segment due to cost-reduction initiatives implemented in the second half of 2023 at R2 Technologies. The decreases in SG A were partially offset by an increase in compensation-related expenses at our Infrastructure segment and, at our Life Sciences segment, increases in sales commissions and selling fees paid by R2 Technologies. The overall decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily driven by our Infrastructure segment, as certain customer contract intangibles became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Interest expense : Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 4.1 million to 21.2 million from 17.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in exit fees and a higher outstanding principal balance at our Life Sciences segment as a result of new debt issued and capitalization of unpaid interest into principal balances subsequent to the comparable period, and, to a lesser extent, an increase at our Non-Operating Corporate segment, as well as an increase at our Spectrum segment due to additional exit fees incurred from a refinancing subsequent to the comparable period. This was partially offset by our Infrastructure segment due to a net decrease in outstanding principal balances. 
 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 5.9 million to 54.9 million from 49.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily attributable to increases in exit fees and a higher outstanding principal balance at our Life Sciences segment as a result of new debt issued and capitalization of unpaid interest into principal balances subsequent to the comparable period, an increase at our Non-Operating Corporate segment due to the issuance of the CGIC Unsecured Note in May 2023, which resulted in five months of interest in the comparable period compared to nine months of interest in the current period, and an increase in the Revolving Line of Credit balance subsequent to the comparable period, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in interest at our Spectrum segment due to additional exit fees incurred from a refinancing subsequent to the comparable period. This was partially offset by our Infrastructure segment due to a net decrease in outstanding principal balances. 
 
 Loss from equity investees: Loss from equity investees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.5 million to zero from a loss of 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in loss from equity investees was primarily due to a decrease in losses recognized from MediBeacon, as Pansend had no basis in MediBeacon against which to recognize any losses, and Pansend's carrying amount of its MediBeacon investment remained at zero. During the comparable period, Pansend made a 1.0 million convertible note investment in MediBeacon, allowing Pansend to recognize previously unrecognized unrealized equity method losses due to an increase in basis in the investment. Also contributing to the decrease in loss from equity investees was the partial sale of Triple Ring which was completed subsequent to the comparable period, and resulted in Pansend's investment in Triple Ring no longer being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Thus, no equity method losses were recognized in the current period. 
 
 43 

Loss from equity investees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 3.5 million to 2.3 million from 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in loss was due to a decrease in losses recognized from MediBeacon, Triple Ring and HMN. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of additional convertible note investments in MediBeacon by Pansend, Pansend's basis in MediBeacon increased by 2.3 million and Pansend recognized 2.3 million of equity method losses that were previously unrecognized, whereas during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of an equity transaction with Huadong, Pansend's basis in MediBeacon had increased by 3.8 million and Pansend had recognized 3.8 million of equity method losses that were previously unrecognized, in addition to other equity method losses recognized for the period. As of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, Pansend's net carrying amount of its investment in MediBeacon was zero, and Pansend had unrecognized losses from this investment. The partial sale of Triple Ring was completed subsequent to the comparable period and resulted in Pansend's investment in Triple Ring no longer being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our previous investment in HMN was sold on March 6, 2023 and had losses for the approximately two months of ownership in 2023. Thus, no equity method losses from Triple Ring or HMN were recognized in the current period. Refer to Note 6. Investments of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our equity investments. 
 
 Other income, net: Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 1.8 million to 2.2 million from 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 1.9 million gain on debt repurchase at our Non-Operating Corporate segment related to the partial repurchase of the 2026 Convertible Notes, an increase in interest income earned at our Life Sciences segment resulting from an increase in Pansend's convertible note receivable balance from MediBeacon subsequent to the comparable period, and our Non-Operating Corporate segment which earned additional interest income on its money market accounts due to an increase in outstanding deposited balances over the comparable period. This was partially offset by an increase in foreign currency translation losses from our Infrastructure segment. 
 
 Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 16.0 million to 1.2 million from 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the unrepeated gain on the sale of the equity investment in HMN of 12.2 million in the comparable period, an unrepeated 3.8 million equity investment step-up gain from an increase in Pansend's basis as a result of MediBeacon issuing 7.5 million of its preferred stock to Huadong in the comparable period, a 2.2 million loss on debt extinguishment at R2 Technologies in the current period and an increase in foreign currency translation losses at our Infrastructure segment. The decrease was partially offset by a 1.9 million gain on debt repurchase at our Non-Operating Corporate segment related to the partial repurchase of the 2026 Convertible Note, an increase in interest income earned at our Life Sciences segment resulting from an increase in Pansend's convertible note receivable balance from MediBeacon subsequent to the comparable period, and our Non-Operating Corporate segment which earned additional interest income on its money market accounts due to an increase in outstanding deposited balances over the comparable period. 
 
 Income tax expense : Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 2.0 million to 3.1 million from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 0.7 million to 3.9 million from 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily driven by the tax expense of INNOVATE's U.S. consolidated group utilizing its remaining unlimited NOLs in 2024 and due to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act's 80 limitation on net operating losses incurred after 2017, resulting in the annual effective tax rate for the current period being applied to the U.S. consolidated group's 2024 year-to-date income as calculated under ASC 740. The annual effective tax rate calculated for the comparable period interim tax provision included an unrepeated 1.1 million tax benefit, consisting of a current tax expense of 4.4 million related to a foreign tax payment and a deferred tax benefit of 5.5 million related to the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the 11.3 million put option, both of which were related to the sale of New Saxon's 19.0 investment in HMN on March 6, 2023. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") has announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including a Pillar Two Model to provide for a 15 global minimum tax on the earnings of multinational corporations with consolidated revenue over 750 million. Many jurisdictions have enacted Pillar Two legislation that starts to become effective in 2024. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and legislation on Pillar Two. Based on current enacted laws, Pillar Two is not expected to materially impact our effective tax rate or cash flows in the next year. We will continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position as new legislation or guidance is introduced which could change our current assessment.

 Revenue: Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 136.5 million to 232.8 million from 369.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 197.5 million to 845.9 million from 1,043.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases were primarily driven by the timing and size of projects, including the effect of changes in estimated costs to complete those projects recognized in the ordinary course of business, at Banker Steel and DBMG's commercial structural steel fabrication and erection business, both of which had increased activity in the comparable period on certain large commercial construction projects that are now at or near completion in the current period. This was partially offset by an increase at the industrial maintenance and repair business as a result of an increase in project work. 
 
 Cost of revenue : Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 124.0 million to 189.1 million from 313.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 201.1 million to 695.7 million from 896.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases were primarily driven by the decrease in revenues at Banker Steel and DBMG's commercial structural steel fabrication and erection business from the timing of project activity on certain large commercial construction projects and decreases in costs as they wind down and near completion in the current period, which was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the industrial maintenance and repair business as a result of an increase in project work. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative : Selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 4.6 million to 28.3 million from 32.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by an unrepeated accounts receivable write-off of 2.2 million related to a customer bankruptcy in the comparable period, a decrease in expenses related to a foreign office closure in the comparable period, as well as a decrease due to timing of compensation-related expenses in the current period. This was partially offset by an increase in expenses related to a domestic plant closure incurred in the current period. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 0.3 million to 93.0 million from 93.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by an unrepeated accounts receivable write-off of 2.2 million related to a customer bankruptcy in the comparable period, a decrease in expenses related to a foreign office closure in the comparable period, a decrease in legal fees and facility-related expenses, which was mostly offset by an increase in compensation-related expenses and expenses related to a domestic plant closure and other restructuring costs incurred in the current period. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 0.4 million to 3.0 million from 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.7 million to 8.9 million from 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the comparable period was primarily driven by Banker Steel, as certain customer contract intangibles became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Other operating loss (income) : Other operating loss (income) was a loss of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which decreased 0.3 million from income of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other operating (income) loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 8.6 million to income of 8.8 million from 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to a gain on a lease modification and a gain on the sale of various properties in the current period, which was partially offset by a loss related to a plant closure in the first quarter of 2024.

 Revenue : Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.4 million to 3.0 million from 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was attributable to R2 Technologies, primarily due to an increase in Glacial fx system sales in North America, which launched during the comparable period, as well as from an increase in consumables sales both worldwide and in North America. In addition, the increase was partially driven by incremental Glacial Spa unit sales outside North America over the comparable period and from the launch of Glacial fx systems outside North America subsequent to the comparable period, as well as a slight increase in Glacial Rx systems sold in North America over the comparable period. 
 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.9 million to 5.7 million from 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was attributable to R2 Technologies, primarily due to incremental unit sales of the Glacial fx system in North America, which launched during the second half of 2023, as well as from an increase in consumable sales in both North America and worldwide. In addition, the increase was partially driven by an increase in Glacial Rx units sold in North America over the comparable period, as well as incremental sales from the launch of the Glacial fx systems outside North America subsequent to the comparable period and incremental Glacial Spa unit sales outside North America over the comparable period. 
 
 Cost of revenue : Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.5 million to 2.0 million from 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.3 million to 3.7 million from 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in cost of revenue were attributable to R2 Technologies, primarily driven by the increases in revenue from the additional system sales noted above, changes in product mix sold as the Glacial fx and Glacial Spa systems have a lower production cost per system compared to the Glacial Rx, and, to a lesser extent, increases in royalty expenses, warranty expenses and freight costs driven by the additional systems sold. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative : Selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.9 million to 4.2 million from 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in selling fees paid by R2 Technologies as well as slight increases in professional fees and sales commissions. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.5 million to 12.2 million from 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases in sales commissions at R2 Technologies due to an increase in system sales, an increase in selling fees paid by R2 Technologies, as well as an increase in professional fees, and an increase in research and development costs at Genovel. This was partially offset by other decreases in R2 Technologies general and administrative expenses including compensation-related expenses, travel and entertainment, and advertising and marketing expenses, as a result of continued cost reduction initiatives, which went into effect the second half of 2023.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 3.6 million to 9.0 million from 12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by unrepeated severance expense related to the Company's former Chief Operating Officer in the comparable period, a decrease in stock-based compensation expense from the acceleration of awards related to our former CEO in the comparable period, a decrease in salaries and benefits from a reduced headcount and a decrease in consulting fees. 
 
 Other operating loss: Other operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased to a loss of 0.2 million from zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lease termination costs for two leases the Company exited in the current period. 

Loss from Equity Investees Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase / (Decrease) Life Sciences (1.5) 1.5 (2.3) (5.5) 3.2 Other (0.3) 0.3 Loss from equity investees (1.5) 1.5 (2.3) (5.8) 3.5 
 
 Life Sciences: Loss from equity investees within our Life Sciences segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.5 million to zero from a loss of 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in loss from equity investees was primarily due to a decrease in losses recognized from MediBeacon, as Pansend had no basis in MediBeacon against which to recognize any losses in the current period, and Pansend's carrying amount of its MediBeacon investment remained at zero. During the comparable period, Pansend made a 1.0 million convertible note investment in MediBeacon, allowing Pansend to recognize previously unrecognized equity method losses due to an increase in basis in the investment. Also contributing to the decrease in loss from equity investees was the partial sale of Triple Ring which was completed subsequent to the comparable period, and resulted in Pansend's investment in Triple Ring no longer being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Thus, no equity method losses were recognized in the current period.

Loss from equity investees within our Life Sciences segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 3.5 million to 2.3 million from 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in loss was primarily due to a decrease in losses recognized from MediBeacon and Triple Ring. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of additional convertible note investments in MediBeacon by Pansend, Pansend's basis in MediBeacon increased by 2.3 million and Pansend recognized 2.3 million of equity method losses that were previously unrecognized, whereas during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of an equity transaction with Huadong, Pansend's basis in MediBeacon had increased by 3.8 million and Pansend had recognized 3.8 million of equity method losses that were previously unrecognized, in addition to other equity method losses recognized for the period. As of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, Pansend's net carrying amount of its investment in MediBeacon was zero, and Pansend had unrecognized losses from this investment. The partial sale of Triple Ring was completed subsequent to the comparable period and resulted in Pansend's investment in Triple Ring no longer being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Thus, no equity method losses were recognized from Triple Ring in the current period. 
 
 Other: Loss from equity investees within our Other segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 0.3 million to zero from a loss of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Loss from equity investees for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by our previous investment in HMN, which was sold on March 6, 2023, and had losses for the approximately two months of ownership in 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Information 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement recognized under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which could limit its usefulness. 
 
 Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with meaningful information for gaining an understanding of our results as it is frequently used by the financial community to provide insight into an organization s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and the other items listed in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA below can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA can also be a useful measure of a company s ability to service debt. While management believes that non-U.S. GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our U.S. GAAP financial results. Using Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure has inherent limitations as an analytical tool as compared to net income (loss) or other U.S. GAAP financial measures, as this non-GAAP measure excludes certain items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be meaningful to investors. As a result of the exclusions, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or other U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance. 
 
 The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by us, consists of Net income (loss) attributable to INNOVATE Corp., excluding: discontinued operations, if applicable; depreciation and amortization; other operating (income) loss, which is inclusive of (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets, lease termination costs, (gains) losses on lease modifications, asset impairment expense and FCC reimbursements; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; income tax expense (benefit); non-controlling interest; share-based compensation expense; legacy accounts receivable write-offs; restructuring and exit costs; and acquisition and disposition costs. 

Adjusted EBITDA by segment is summarized as follows:

 Infrastructure: Net income from our Infrastructure segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 4.6 million to 6.2 million from 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA from our Infrastructure segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 9.9 million to 20.9 million from 30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by lower revenue at both DBMG's commercial structural steel fabrication and erection business and Banker Steel, partially offset by higher margins, due to timing of completion of certain large commercial construction projects that are now at or near completion in the current period, including the effect of changes in estimated costs to complete those projects recognized in the ordinary course of business, as well as lower margins at the construction modeling and detailing business. This was partially offset by an increase in revenue and margins at the industrial maintenance and repair business and a decrease in recurring SG A expenses primarily as a result of a decrease due to timing of compensation-related expenses in the current period.

Life Sciences: Net loss from our Life Sciences segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 2.4 million to 6.0 million from 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss from our Life Sciences segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.3 million to 3.0 million from 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily due to a decrease in equity method losses recognized from MediBeacon and Triple Ring, as discussed in Loss from Equity Investees above. Additionally contributing to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss was an increase in gross profit at R2 Technologies, driven by an increase in sales in North America and worldwide of all R2's products, including Glacial fx systems, consumables, Glacial Spa systems and Glacial Rx systems. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss was partially offset by an increase in SG A expenses at R2 Technologies, primarily as a result of an increase in selling fees. 
 
 Spectrum: Net loss from our Spectrum segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 0.9 million to 5.6 million from 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA from our Spectrum segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 2.0 million to 1.7 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in revenue driven by network launches and expanded coverage with existing customers and unrepeated severance in the comparable period, which was partially offset by the termination of a number of smaller networks and individual markets in the comparable period. 
 
 Non-Operating Corporate: Net loss from our Non-Operating Corporate segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 1.9 million to 9.6 million from 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss from our Non-Operating Corporate segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.3 million to 2.8 million from 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily driven by unrepeated severance expense related to the Company's former Chief Operating Officer in the comparable period.

 Infrastructure: Net income from our Infrastructure segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 11.8 million to 31.6 million from 19.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA from our Infrastructure segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 1.1 million to 71.7 million from 70.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by higher margins on certain large commercial construction projects that are now at or near completion in the current period at DBMG's commercial structural steel fabrication and erection, including the effect of changes in estimated costs to complete those projects recognized in the ordinary course of business, despite the decrease in revenue, and increases in revenue and margins at the industrial maintenance and repair businesses, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue at Banker Steel, despite an increase in margins, due to timing of completion of certain large commercial construction projects, an increase in recurring SG A, primarily as a result of compensation-related expenses, and decreased margins at the construction modeling and detailing business. 
 
 Life Sciences: Net loss from our Life Sciences segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 5.0 million to 14.3 million from 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss from our Life Sciences segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 4.0 million to 12.0 million from 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily due to a decrease in equity method losses recognized from MediBeacon and Triple Ring, as discussed in Loss from Equity Investees above. Additionally contributing to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss was an increase in gross profit at R2 Technologies, driven by an increase in sales in North America and worldwide of all R2's products, including Glacial fx systems, consumables, Glacial Spa systems and Glacial Rx systems. In addition, certain SG A expenses at R2 Technologies decreased due to cost reduction initiatives which went into effect in the second half of 2023, which were offset by increases in sales commissions due to an increase in system sales, an increase in selling fees, an increase in professional fees and an increase research and development costs at Genovel. 
 
 Spectrum: Net loss from our Spectrum segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.4 million to 15.4 million from 16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA from our Spectrum segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 3.9 million to 4.8 million from 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in revenue primarily driven by network launches and expanded coverage with existing customers, unrepeated severance in the comparable period, as well as a decrease in salaries and benefits expense. This was partially offset by the termination of a number of smaller networks and individual markets in the comparable period. 
 
 Non-Operating Corporate: Net loss from our Non-Operating Corporate segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 7.8 million to 20.0 million from 27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss from our Non-Operating Corporate segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.8 million to 8.2 million from 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily driven by an unrepeated severance expense related to the Company's former Chief Operating Officer in the comparable period, a decrease in salaries and benefits from a reduced headcount, and a decrease in consulting fees. 
 
 Other and Eliminations: Net income from our Other segment and Eliminations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 8.1 million to 0.1 million from 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA losses from our Other segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.0 million to zero from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss was driven primarily by unrepeated severance related expenses at TIC Holdco, Inc. in the comparable period and our previous investment in HMN, which was sold on March 6, 2023, and had equity method losses for the approximately two months of ownership in 2023.

Backlog 
 
 Projects in backlog consist of awarded contracts, letters of intent, notices to proceed, change orders, and purchase orders obtained. Backlog increases as contract commitments are obtained, decreases as revenues are recognized and increases or decreases to reflect modifications in the work to be performed under the contracts. Backlog is converted to sales in future periods as work is performed or projects are completed. Backlog can be significantly affected by the receipt or loss of individual contracts. 
 
 Infrastructure Segment 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, DBMG's backlog was 916.1 million, consisting of 823.7 million under contracts or purchase orders and 92.4 million under letters of intent or notices to proceed. Approximately 418.0 million, representing 45.6 of DBMG s backlog as of September 30, 2024, was attributable to five contracts, letters of intent, notices to proceed or purchase orders. If one or more of these projects terminate or reduce their scope, DBMG s backlog could decrease substantially. DBMG includes an additional 12.1 million in its backlog that is not included in the remaining unsatisfied performance obligations disclosed in Note 3. Revenue and Contracts in Process. This additional backlog includes commitments under master service agreements that are estimated amounts of work to be performed based on customer communications, historic performance and knowledge of our customers' intentions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Short- and Long-Term Liquidity Considerations and Risks 
 
 Our Non-Operating Corporate segment consists of holding companies, and its liquidity needs are primarily for interest payments on its 2026 Senior Secured Notes, 2026 Convertible Notes, Revolving Line of Credit, CGIC Unsecured Note, and dividend payments on its Series A-3 and Series A-4 Preferred Stock and recurring operational expenses. 
 
 On a consolidated basis, as of September 30, 2024, we had 51.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, compared to 80.8 million as of December 31, 2023. On a stand-alone basis, as of September 30, 2024, our Non-Operating Corporate segment had cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, of 20.2 million compared to 2.5 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our subsidiaries' principal liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities, debt service, and capital expenditures, including purchases of steel construction equipment, OTA broadcast station equipment, development of back-office systems, operating costs and expenses, and income taxes. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 699.2 million of principal indebtedness on a consolidated basis compared to 722.8 million as of December 31, 2023, a net decrease of 23.6 million, which was primarily due to a 22.0 million net decrease in debt at our Infrastructure segment and a 7.0 million decrease in debt at our Non-Operating Corporate segment, partially offset by the capitalization of unpaid accrued interest at R2 Technologies into the principal amount of 5.4 million. 
 
 On a stand-alone basis, our Non-Operating Corporate segment indebtedness was 429.9 million and 436.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of 7.0 million driven by a partial redemption payment of 4.1 million of the CGIC Unsecured Note on April 26, 2024 and the repurchase of 2.9 million principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The September 30, 2024 indebtedness balance consists of the 330.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Senior Secured Notes, 48.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes, 31.0 million remaining principal amount of the CGIC Unsecured Note and 20.0 million aggregate principal amount drawn on our Revolving Line of Credit. Our Non-Operating Corporate segment is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the 2026 Senior Secured Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes on February 1st and August 1st of each year, quarterly interest payments on the Revolving Line of Credit, and monthly interest payments on the CGIC Unsecured Note. As described below, the interest rate on the CGIC Unsecured Note increased from 9.0 per annum to 16.0 per annum on May 9, 2024, and will increase from 16.0 per annum to 32.0 per annum on May 9, 2025. 
 
 We are required to make dividend payments on our outstanding Series A-3 Preferred Stock and Series A-4 Preferred Stock on January 15 th , April 15 th , July 15 th , and October 15 th of each year. 
 
 Our Non-Operating Corporate segment received 1.4 million and 8.0 million in net tax sharing payments from our Infrastructure segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In addition, DBMG redeemed the intercompany 41.8 million DBMG Series A Preferred Stock from DBMGi on June 28, 2024, for 41.8 million in cash, which was remitted to INNOVATE. DBM Global Intermediate Holdco Inc. ("DBMGi") is a 100 owned subsidiary of INNOVATE and all intercompany transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
 
 We have financed our growth and operations to date, and expect to finance our future growth and operations, through public offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities, credit facilities, vendor financing, finance lease financing and other financing arrangements, as well as cash generated from the operations of our subsidiaries. In the future, we may also choose to sell assets or certain investments to generate cash.

Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement 
 
 On March 8, 2024, the Company commenced a 19.0 million rights offering ("Rights Offering") for its common stock. Pursuant to the Rights Offering, the Company distributed to each holder of the Company s common stock, Series A-3 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, Series A-4 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock and the 2026 Convertible Notes as of March 6, 2024 (the rights offering record date ), transferable subscription rights to purchase 0.2858 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of 0.70 per whole share (on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis). 
 
 Per the concurrent investment agreement entered into with Lancer Capital (the "Investment Agreement"), the Rights Offering was backstopped by Lancer Capital, an investment fund led by Avram A. Glazer, the Chairman of the Board and the Company s largest stockholder. Due to limitations on the common stock that can be issued to Lancer Capital under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), in lieu of exercising its subscription rights, pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Lancer Capital would purchase up to 19.0 million of the Company s newly issued Series C Non-Voting Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series C Preferred Stock ), for an issue price of 1,000 per share. In connection with the backstop commitment, and as a result of limitations in the amount common equity that can be raised under the Company s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, Lancer Capital also agreed to purchase an additional 16.0 million of Series C Preferred Stock in a private placement transaction ("Concurrent Private Placement") which was to close concurrently with the settlement of the Rights Offering. Lancer Capital did not receive any compensation or other consideration for entering into or consummating the Investment Agreement. 
 
 As the Rights Offering had not yet settled by March 28, 2024, in accordance with the Investment Agreement, Lancer Capital purchased 25.0 million of Series C Preferred Stock, referred to as the "equity advance." On April 24, 2024, the Company completed and closed on the Rights Offering and issued a total of 530,611 shares of common stock (5,306,105 shares of common stock on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis) for 3.7 million. Based on the number of shares of common stock actually sold upon exercise of the rights to third party investors, there were no excess shares of Series C Preferred Stock purchased by Lancer Capital under the equity advance that the Company was required to redeem, and Lancer Capital purchased an additional approximately 6,286 Series C Preferred Stock for 6.3 million under the backstop commitment. In total, the Company received 35.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds related to the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement and incurred 1.8 million in dealer manager fees and other related costs which have been capitalized into Additional paid in capital ("APIC"). INNOVATE has been utilizing and expects to continue to use the net proceeds from the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement for general corporate purposes, including debt service and working capital. In addition, as a result of the closing of the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement, a mandatory prepayment was required on the CGIC Unsecured Note, and consequently, on April 26, 2024, INNOVATE redeemed 4.1 million of the CGIC Unsecured Note. 
 
 Under the rules of the NYSE, because the shares purchased by Lancer Capital were greater than 20 of the Company's common stock outstanding before the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock, those shares of Series C Preferred Stock were not allowed to be converted until stockholder approval of such issuance was obtained. On June 18, 2024, the Company held its annual shareholder meeting where Company's shareholder's approved the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. As a result, approximately 31,286 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, which were held by Lancer Capital, were converted into 4,469,390 shares of common stock (44,693,895 shares of common stock on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis). 
 
 The Company waived its Tax Benefits Preservation Plan to permit persons exercising rights to acquire 4.9 or more of the outstanding common stock upon the exercise thereof without becoming an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan). 
 
 INNOVATE has used and expects to continue to use the net proceeds from the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement for general corporate purposes, including debt service and for working capital. As a result of the closing of the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement, a mandatory prepayment was required on the CGIC Unsecured Note, in the amount of the greater of 3.0 million or 12.5 of the net proceeds. On April 26, 2024, INNOVATE redeemed 4.1 million of the CGIC Unsecured Note. See Note 15. Equity and Temporary Equity for additional information. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. However, as of the date of these financial statements, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 
 
 The principal conditions leading to this conclusion are the upcoming maturities of current debt at certain of the Company's subsidiaries as well as from certain cross-default provisions in the Company's Senior Secured Notes. Based on these conditions, the Company may not be able to meet its obligations at maturity and comply with certain cross-default provisions under the Senior Secured Notes over the next 12 months. 
 
 Management has evaluated the significance of these conditions in relation to the Company's ability to meet its obligations. The inability to refinance or extend the maturity of the current debt at the Company's subsidiaries, or to obtain additional financing, raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 53 

The Company plans to alleviate these conditions through various initiatives it is currently exploring, including refinancing the debt at Broadcasting and DBMG, pursuing asset sales, and raising additional capital. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will have the ability to raise additional capital when needed, be successful in any asset sales, or refinance its existing debt, on attractive terms, or at all nor any assurances that lenders will provide additional extensions, waivers or amendments in the event of future non-compliance with the Company s debt covenants or other possible events of default. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to execute a reduction, extension, or refinancing of the debt, or that the terms of any replacement financing would be as favorable as the terms of the debt prior to the maturity date. There can be no assurance that these plans will be successfully implemented or that they will mitigate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, or expenses that may result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

 2026 Senior Secured Notes 
 
 On February 1, 2021, our Non-Operating Corporate segment repaid the senior secured notes that were due in 2021 and issued 330.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.50 senior secured notes due February 1, 2026 (the "2026 Senior Secured Notes"). The 2026 Senior Secured Notes mature on February 1, 2026, and accrue interest at a rate of 8.50 per year, which interest is paid semi-annually on February 1 st and August 1 st of each year. If the Company sells certain assets and the net cash proceeds from all applicable asset sales exceed 50.0 million since the issue date of the 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the Company may be required in certain circumstances to make an offer to purchase the notes with the net cash proceeds from such an asset sale in excess of such 50.0 million threshold at a price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. For additional information on the terms and conditions of the 2026 Senior Secured Notes, including guarantees, ranking and collateral, refer to Note 11. Debt Obligations included in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024. 
 
 2026 Convertible Notes 
 
 The original 51.8 million aggregate principal amount of 7.50 convertible notes (the "2026 Convertible Notes") were issued under a separate indenture dated February 1, 2021, between the Company and U.S. Bank, as trustee (the "Convertible Indenture"). In July 2024, we repurchased 2.9 million principal amount of our 2026 Convertible Notes at a market discount for 1.1 million, which is inclusive of accrued interest of 0.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 48.9 million principal amount of 2026 Convertible Notes outstanding. The 2026 Convertible Notes mature on August 1, 2026 unless earlier converted, redeemed or purchased. The 2026 Convertible Notes accrue interest at a rate of 7.5 per year, which interest is paid semi-annually on February 1 st and August 1 st of each year. 
 
 For additional information on the terms and conditions of the 2026 Convertible Notes, including optional redemption, conversion rights guarantees, ranking and collateral, refer to Note 11. Debt Obligations included in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024. 
 
 Our debt contains customary events of default which could, subject to certain conditions, cause the 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes to become immediately due and payable. 
 
 54 

Revolving Line of Credit 
 
 We have a revolving credit agreement with MSD PCOF Partners IX, LLC ("MSD") which has a maximum commitment of 20.0 million ("Revolving Line of Credit"), of which 20.0 million had been drawn as of September 30, 2024. Interest on loans under the Revolving Line of Credit accrues at SOFR plus 5.75 and is payable quarterly. The Revolving Line of Credit also includes a commitment fee at a per annum rate of 1.0 calculated based off the actual daily amount of unused availability under the Revolving Line of Credit with MSD. The maturity date of the Revolving Line of Credit, as amended on May 6, 2024, is May 16, 2025. The amount outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit is subject to mandatory prepayment from the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales in excess of 10.0 million. 
 
 For additional information on the terms and conditions of the Revolving Line of Credit, including guarantees and ranking and collateral, refer to Note 11. Debt Obligations included in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024. 
 
 CGIC Unsecured Note 
 
 On May 9, 2023, in connection with the redemption of the DBMGi Series A Preferred Stock, the Company issued a subordinated unsecured promissory note to CGIC in the principal amount of 35.1 million (the "CGIC Unsecured Note"). The CGIC Unsecured Note is due February 28, 2026, and bore interest at 9.0 per annum through May 8, 2024, bears interest at 16.0 per annum from May 9, 2024 to May 8, 2025, and 32.0 per annum thereafter. The CGIC Unsecured Note also requires a mandatory prepayment from the proceeds from certain asset sales and the greater of 3.0 million or 12.5 of the net proceeds from certain equity sales. Other covenants in the CGIC Unsecured Note are generally consistent with the Company's Indenture governing the 8.50 Senior Secured Notes due 2026, dated as of February 1, 2021, by and among the Company, the guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association. As a result of the closing of the Rights Offering on April 24, 2024, INNOVATE redeemed 4.1 million of the CGIC Unsecured Note on April 26, 2024. Refer to Note 15. Temporary Equity and Equity and to Note 11. Debt Obligations included in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024, for additional information, as well as Note 15. Equity and Temporary Equity included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional details regarding the 4.1 million partial redemption. 
 
 Infrastructure 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Infrastructure segment has aggregate principal outstanding debt, including obligations under finance leases, of 176.8 million. 
 
 DBMG has a 135.0 million Revolving Line with UMB that bears interest at a prime rate minus a spread with an interest rate floor of 4.25 . As of September 30, 2024 the outstanding balance was 75.0 million. The effective interest rate on the Revolving Line with UMB was 7.52 and 8.33 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Revolving Line with UMB matures on August 15, 2025, and interest is paid monthly. The Revolving Line with UMB also includes a commitment fee equal to 0.25 per annum times the average daily unused availability under the line. DBMG also has a 76.3 million term loan due 2026 (the "3.25 UMB Term Loan"), which expires May 31, 2026, and bears interest at an annual rate of 3.25 with an effective interest rate of 3.3 . Interest is paid monthly. 
 
 On June 28, 2024, DBM and UMB entered into the Third Amendment to the UMB Credit Agreement. The amendment adds an incremental separate term loan of 25.0 million to the existing credit facility, with the same interest rate as the Revolving Line with UMB and the same maturity date as the initial 76.3 million 3.25 UMB Term Loan. Principal payments and interest are paid monthly. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, DBMG made 5.0 million in scheduled payments on the 4.0 note that was payable to Banker Steel's former owner. The 4.0 note matured on March 31, 2024 and was fully redeemed on April 2, 2024.

 Life Sciences 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Life Sciences segment has aggregate principal outstanding debt of 22.8 million. 
 
 R2 Technologies had various short-term notes with Lancer Capital, which expired on January 31, 2024, and, effective January 31, 2024, a new 20 note with an aggregate original principal amount of 20.0 million was issued, which was comprised of all prior outstanding principal amounts and unpaid accrued interest of 2.6 million which was capitalized into the new principal balance. Interest on the note accrues at 20 per annum and is payable monthly in arrears, in cash or, if not paid in cash, accrued and unpaid interest is capitalized monthly into the principal balance. The 20 20.0 million note also includes an exit fee of 10.5 of the principal amount being repaid if repaid anytime from April 1, 2024 through April 30, 2024. The original maturity date of the 20 20.0 million note was April 30, 2024, or within five business days of the date on which R2 Technologies receives an aggregate 20.0 million from the consummation of a debt or equity financing or has a change in control, as defined in the agreement, with an optional prepayment of the entire then-outstanding and unpaid principal and accrued interest upon five-days written notice to Lancer Capital. Effective May 17, 2024, the maturity date of the note was extended to December 31, 2024, and the exit fees were amended. 
 55 

The initial exit fee, as amended, as of September 30, 2024 was equal to 11.39 of the principal amount being repaid and continues to increase by 0.17 each month thereafter until maturity. Effective July 31, 2024, an additional exit fee of 1.0 million was incurred under the amendment, which increases by 1.0 million each month until the end of November 2024. If unpaid prior to maturity, the total exit fees payable will be 7.9 million. The exit fees are being amortized over the term of the note using the effective interest rate method and are included in interest expense. The exit fees are payable on the earliest of the maturity date, the date of the acceleration of the principal amount of the note for any reason or, if any portion of the note is prepaid at any time, the date of such prepayment of the note. As of September 30, 2024, total accrued exit fees were 5.6 million and were included within Accrued liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 11. Debt Obligations of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional information. 
 
 Spectrum 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Spectrum segment has aggregate principal outstanding debt of 69.7 million, consisting of 8.50 and 11.45 Notes. Interest is capitalized and payable upon maturity of the notes. The maturity date of Spectrum's 8.50 and 11.45 Notes, is August 15, 2025, as amended. 
 
 The exit fees associated with the notes, which are payable on the earlier of maturity or repayment of the principal, were recorded as original issue discount and are being amortized over the remaining life of the notes, which is assumed to be the maturity date. A corresponding liability of 15.9 million is reflected within Other Current Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, and a corresponding liability of 15.9 million was reflected within Other Liabilities (non-current) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rates on the notes, as amended, ranged from 20.6 to 24.0 per annum. 
 
 During November 2023, concurrently with Broadcasting's execution of the Ninth Amendment to Secured Notes, which among other things extended the maturity of the notes, INNOVATE entered into a related side letter with the lenders, whereby INNOVATE agreed to utilize proceeds from the sale of certain of its existing operations, as allowable under the Company's current agreements and indentures and after all other required payments have been made, for repayment of a portion of our Spectrum segment's Senior Secured Notes. Assuming there are sufficient proceeds remaining after such repayment, an additional 1.0 million fee is payable if repayment occurs by November 9, 2024, or 2.0 million if repayment occurs after that date. In exchange for the additional fee, the institutional investors will return their equity interests in HC2 Broadcasting Holdings, Inc. and their equity interests in DTV America.

 Restrictive Covenants 
 
 The indenture governing the 2026 Senior Secured Notes dated February 1, 2021, by and among INNOVATE, the guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association, as trustee (the "Secured Indenture"), contains certain affirmative and negative covenants limiting, among other things, the ability of the Company, and, in certain cases, the Company s subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness; create liens; engage in sale-leaseback transactions; pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock; make certain restricted payments; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; or consolidate or merge with, or sell substantially all of its assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. 
 
 The Company is also required to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants, which are similarly subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. These covenants include maintenance of (1) liquidity and (2) collateral coverage. 
 
 The maintenance of liquidity covenant provides that the Company will not permit the aggregate amount of (i) all unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, (ii) amounts available for drawing under revolving credit facilities and undrawn letters of credit of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and (iii) dividends, distributions or payments that are immediately available to be paid to the Company by any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be less than the Company s obligation to pay interest for the next six months on the 2026 Senior Secured Notes and all other Debt, including Convertible Series A-3 and Series A-4 Preferred Stock mandatory cash dividends or any other mandatory cash pay Series A-3 and Series A-4 Preferred Stock but excluding any obligation to pay interest on Series A-3 and Series A-4 Preferred Stock or any other mandatory cash payments on Series A-3 and Series A-4 Preferred Stock which, in each case, may be paid by accretion or in-kind in accordance with its terms of the Company and its Subsidiary Guarantors. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. 
 
 The maintenance of collateral coverage provides that the certain subsidiaries' Collateral Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Secured Indenture as the ratio of (i) the Loan Collateral to (ii) Consolidated Secured Debt (each as defined therein)) calculated on a pro forma basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter may not be less than 1.50 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. 
 
 The instruments governing the Company s Series A-3 Preferred Stock and Series A-4 Preferred Stock also limit the Company s and its subsidiaries ability to take certain actions, including, among other things, to incur additional indebtedness; issue additional Series A-3 Preferred Stock and Series A-4 Preferred Stock; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make certain restricted payments. These limitations are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. 
 56 

The Company has conducted its operations in a manner that has resulted in compliance with the Secured Indenture; however, compliance with certain financial covenants for future periods may depend on the Company or one or more of the Company s subsidiaries undertaking one or more non-operational transactions, such as the management of operating cash outflows, a monetization of assets, a debt incurrence or refinancing, the raising of equity capital, or similar transactions. If the Company is unable to remain in compliance and does not make alternate arrangements, an event of default would occur under the Company s Secured Indenture which, among other remedies, could result in the outstanding obligations under the indenture becoming immediately due and payable and permitting the exercise of remedies with respect to the collateral. There is no assurance the Company will be able to complete any non-operational transaction it may undertake to maintain compliance with covenants under the Secured Indenture or, even if the Company completes any such transaction, that it will be able to maintain compliance for any subsequent period. 
 
 The UMB term loans and Revolving Line with UMB associated with our Infrastructure segment contain customary restrictive and financial covenants related to debt levels and performance, including a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant, as defined in the agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements. 

Summary of Consolidated Cash Flows 
 
 The below table summarizes the cash provided by or used in our activities (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 Cash used in operating activities (32.3) (34.7) 2.4 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (4.0) 41.2 (45.2) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 6.4 (30.6) 37.0 Effects of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 0.1 (1.0) 1.1 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash (29.8) (25.1) (4.7) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash used in operating activities was 32.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 34.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an improvement of 2.4 million. Cash flows from operations are primarily influenced by changes in the timing of demand for services and by operating margins, but can also be affect ed by working capital needs associated with our operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the improvement in operating cash flows was primarily driven by our Non-Operating Corporate segment, which had reductions in SG A expenses related to unrepeated severance payments in the prior period and reductions in salaries and benefits in the current period due to headcount decreases, and our Other segment, which had an unrepeated 4.4 million foreign tax payment in the prior period related to the sale of New Saxon's 19 investment in in HMN on March 6, 2023. This was partially offset by a net decrease in working capital cash flows at our Infrastructure segment, primarily driven by normal business fluctuations in accounts receivable, contract-related assets and liabilities, other accrued liabilities and other current liabilities. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of 41.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 45.2 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the 54.2 million of gross cash proceeds received in the prior period from the sale of New Saxon's 19.0 investment in HMN on March 6, 2023. Partially offsetting this decrease, was an increase in proceeds from the disposal of PP E, which totaled 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily related to the sale of various PP E at our Infrastructure segment, as compared to 1.5 million in proceeds for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 11.8 million, as compared to 13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease in cash used of 2.1 million. Loans made by our Life Sciences segment to MediBeacon totaled 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.3 million. 
 
 57 

Financing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used in financing activities of 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an improvement in financing cash flows of 37.0 million. The improvement was primarily driven by our Non-Operating Corporate segment, which received 33.2 million in net proceeds in the current period from the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made 15.9 million in distributions to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests related to the sale of New Saxon's 19.0 investment in HMN on March 6, 2023. Our Corporate Segment also made a 7.0 million payment in the prior period connection with the repurchase of the DBMGi Series A Preferred Stock on May 9, 2023 from CGIC, and dividend payments decreased by 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the repurchase of the DBMGi Series A Preferred Stock. These improvements in financing cash flows were partially offset by a 35.0 million increase in net outflows from revolving credit line activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which includes a net 25.0 million payment in the current period and included net proceeds of 10.0 million in the prior period related to our Infrastructure segment's Revolving Line with UMB. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash outflows from other debt obligations decreased by 14.6 million, primarily driven by proceeds of 25.0 million in the current period from an incremental separate term loan at our Infrastructure segment, partially offset by a 4.1 million repayment on the CGIC Unsecured Note and a 1.0 million principal payment for the partial repurchase of the 2026 Convertible Notes at our Corporate Non-Segment in the current period, and a decrease in proceeds from other debt obligations with Lancer Capital of 5.3 million at our Life Sciences segment.

 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities are the principal source of cash used to fund DBMG s operating expenses, interest payments on debt, and capital expenditures. DBMG's short-term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations including receivables, inventories, and other costs incurred in performing on its contracts. DBMG attempts to structure the payment arrangements under its contracts to match costs incurred under the project. To the extent it is able to bill in advance of costs incurred, DBMG generates working capital through billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts. DBMG relies on its credit facilities to meet its working capital needs. DBMG believes that its available funds, cash generated by operating activities and funds available under its bank credit facilities will be adequate to meet all funding requirements for its operating expenses, working capital needs, interest payments on debt and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, DBMG may expand its operations through future acquisitions and may require additional equity or debt financing. 
 
 DBMG is required to make monthly interest payments on all of its debt. Based upon the September 30, 2024 debt balance, DBMG anticipates that its interest payments will be approximately 2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 and approximately 1.9 million for each quarter of 2025.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Disclosure controls and procedures mean our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, one of our subsidiaries successfully implemented a new Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system, which replaced operating and financial systems and resulted in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. We have taken steps to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and operating effectively in the new system environment. These changes have been and will continue to be subject to our evaluation of the operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 Other than as disclosed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The Company is subject to claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that the outcome of any such matter will be decided favorably to the Company or that the resolution of any such matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not believe that any of such pending claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records a liability in its Consolidated Financial Statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary for the Consolidated Financial Statements not to be misleading. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference for additional information.

See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part I of such Fiscal Year 2023 Form 10-K for a complete description of the material risks we face. 
 
 Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
 
 As of the date of these financial statements, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The principal conditions leading to this conclusion are the upcoming maturities of current debt at certain of the Company's subsidiaries as well as from certain cross-default provisions in the Company's Senior Secured Notes. Based on these conditions, the Company may not be able to meet its obligations at maturity and comply with certain cross-default provisions under the Senior Secured Notes over the next 12 months. The Company plans to alleviate these conditions through various initiatives it is currently exploring, including refinancing the debt at Broadcasting and DBMG, pursuing asset sales, and raising additional capital. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will have the ability to raise additional capital when needed, be successful in any asset sales, or refinance its existing debt, on attractive terms, or at all, nor any assurances that lenders will provide additional extensions, waivers or amendments in the event of future non-compliance with the Company s debt covenants or other possible events of default. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to execute a reduction, extension, or refinancing of the debt, or that the terms of any replacement financing would be as favorable as the terms of the debt prior to the maturity date. There can be no assurance that these plans will be successfully implemented or that they will mitigate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The inability to refinance or extend the maturity of the current debt at the Company's subsidiaries, or to raise sufficient cash to pay the debt at maturity would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and likely cause the price of the Company s common stock to decline. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 Equity Award Share Withholding 
 
 Shares of common stock withheld as payment of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting or exercise of equity awards are treated as common stock repurchases. Those withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under an authorized common stock repurchase plan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no shares withheld in connection with the vesting of employee equity awards. 
 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 
 Series C Private Placement 
 
 On March 28, 2024, the Company issued and sold 25,000 shares of its Series C Non-Voting Participating Convertible Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 per share Series C Preferred Stock for the aggregate purchase price of 25.0 million to Lancer Capital LLC Lancer Capital ), an investment fund led by Avram A. Glazer, the Chairman of the Company s board of directors, pursuant to that Investment Agreement dated as of March 5, 2024 (the Investment Agreement by and between the Company and Lancer Capital. The related Rights Offering and the Company s entry into the Investment Agreement was disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 6, 2024. 
 
 On April 24, 2024, in connection with the closing of the Rights Offering, the Company sold approximately 6,286 additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock to Lancer Capital in consideration of Lancer Capital funding 6.3 million pursuant to the Investment Agreement. 
 
 On June 18, 2024, the Company held its annual shareholder meeting where Company's shareholder's approved the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. As a result, approximately 31,286 Series C Preferred Stock, held by Lancer Capital were converted into 4,469,390 shares of common stock (44,693,895 shares of common stock on a pre Reverse Stock Split basis). 
 
 These issuances and sales were consummated without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company is basing such reliance upon representations made by Lancer Capital, including, but not limited to, representations as to Lancer Capital s status as an accredited investor (as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act) and Lancer Capital s investment intent. The Series C Preferred Stock was not offered or sold by any form of general solicitation or general advertising (as such terms are used in Rule 502 under the Securities Act). The Series C Preferred Stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof may not be re-offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an exemption from the registration requirements under applicable federal and state securities laws.

Use of Proceeds 
 
 The Company received 35.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds related to the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement (inclusive of the 31.3 million from Lancer Capital discussed above) and incurred 1.8 million in dealer manager fees and other related costs. INNOVATE is utilizing and expects to continue to use the net proceeds from the Rights Offering and Concurrent Series C Private Placement for general corporate purposes, including debt service and working capital. In addition, as a result of the closing of the Rights Offering and Concurrent Private Placement, a mandatory prepayment was required on the CGIC Unsecured Note, and on April 26, 2024, INNOVATE redeemed 4.1 million of the CGIC Unsecured Note.
