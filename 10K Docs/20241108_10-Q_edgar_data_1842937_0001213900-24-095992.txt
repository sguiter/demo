Unaudited Notes to Condensed Financial Statements 

Public Offering (Note 5) and a private placement of warrants (the Private Placement
Warrants to our Sponsor, our Direct Anchor Investors (as defined below) and Other Anchor Investors (as defined below) Private
Placement (Note 4). Upon the closing of the Public Offering and the Private Placement (including the underwriters over-allotment
option exercise), was deposited in a trust account (the Trust Account ). However, due to redemptions in October
2023, January 2024 and September 2024, the Trust Account is approximately and at September 30, 2024 (after giving
effect to redemptions payable at that date) and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Trust Account: 

The funds in the Trust Account have been held in
an interest-bearing demand deposit account or invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of one hundred and eighty-five
(185) days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 which
invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. Funds will remain in the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the consummation of
the initial Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. The remaining funds outside the Trust
Account have been used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisition targets and continuing general
and administrative expenses. 

Extensions of Time to Complete Business Combination, Related Redemptions
of Shares of Class A Common Stock and Related Excise Tax: 

At a special meeting of stockholders held on September
29, 2023 (the 2023 Extension Meeting ), the Company s stockholders approved the proposal (the 2023 Extension
Amendment to amend and restate the Company s certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company must (i)
consummate an initial Business Combination, (ii) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, and (iii) redeem or repurchase
 of the Company s Class A common stock included as part of the units sold in the Public Offering from October 1, 2023 to January
10, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors of the Company, the Initial Extended Date ). 

6 

of the Company s Class A common stock included as part of the units sold in the Public Offering from the Initial Extended Date
to September 30, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors of the Company). 

At a special meeting of stockholders held on September
30, 2024 (the 2024 Extension Meeting II ), the Company s stockholders approved the proposal (the 2024 Extension
Amendment II, together with 2024 Extension Amendment, the 2024 Extension Amendments to amend and restate the Company s
certificate of incorporation to (1) extend the date by which the Company must (i) consummate an initial Business Combination, (ii) cease
all operations except for the purpose of winding up, and (iii) redeem or repurchase of the Company s Class A common stock included
as part of the units sold in the Public Offering from September 30, 2024 to March 31, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined by the
board of directors of the Company, the Extended Date ), and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect,
by resolution of the Company s board of directors, to further extend the Extended Date to consummate a Business Combination up to
three times for an additional one month each time, until up to June 30, 2025, unless the closing of a Business Combination shall have
occurred prior thereto; and (2) remove the limitation from the Company s certificate of incorporation that the Company may not redeem
any Class A common stock issued pursuant to the Public Offering public shares to the extent that such redemption would
result in the Company s failure to have net tangible assets in excess of million (the Redemption Limitation Amendment ). 

The Company s amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that, other than the withdrawal of interest to pay tax obligations, if any (less up to of interest
to pay dissolution expenses), none of the funds held in trust will be released until the earliest of: (a) the completion of the initial
Business Combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company s
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem 
of the public shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination by the Extended Date, or such later date up to
June 30, 2025 as may be resolved by the Company s board of directors or if stockholders approve an extension of such date, or (ii)
with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-Business Combination activity, and (c) the redemption
of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination prior to the Extended Date, or such later date
up to June 30, 2025 as may be resolved by the Company s board of directors, or if stockholders approve an extension of such date,
subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of creditors, if any, which
could have priority over the claims of the Company s public stockholders. 

On September 29, 2023, in connection with the 2023
Extension Meeting, stockholders holding shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro
rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As such in October 2023, the Company redeemed shares of Class A common stock
for approximately , or approximately per share. 

In January 2024, in connection with the 2024 Extension
Meeting, stockholders holding shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion
of the funds in the Trust Account. As such, in January 2024, the Company redeemed shares of Class A common stock for approximately
 , or approximately per share. 

On September 30, 2024, in connection with the 2024
Extension Meeting II, stockholders holding shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a
pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As such, in October 2024, the Company redeemed shares of Class A common
stock for approximately , or approximately per share. 

Management has evaluated the requirements
of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Company s operations, and has recorded a liability of of the amount of the October 2023
redemptions, approximately , as of December 31, 2023. This liability is recorded as a reduction to accumulated deficit as it is
related to the capital stock of the Company. This liability will be reevaluated and remeasured at the end of such subsequent period until
it is settled. Management is continuing to evaluate the requirements of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Company s operations,
with respect to the January 2024 and September 30, 2024 redemptions and has concluded that substantial uncertainties exist as to whether
such redemptions would result in additional liability at September 30, 2024 as such no amount of potential additionally liability has
been recorded. 

7 

of the balance in the Trust Account (less the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes
payable on interest earned) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with the Company s initial Business Combination.
There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

The Company, after signing a definitive agreement
for a Business Combination, will either (i) seek stockholder approval of the Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose
in connection with which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Business Combination,
for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the
consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable, or (ii) provide stockholders with the opportunity
to have their shares redeemed by the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount
in cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to commencement
of the tender offer, including interest but less taxes payable. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval
of the Business Combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its
discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would
otherwise require the Company to seek stockholder approval unless a vote is required by the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market. If the
Company seeks stockholder approval, it will complete its Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A
and Class B common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 

If the Company holds a stockholder vote or there
is a tender offer for shares in connection with a Business Combination, a public stockholder will have the right to redeem its shares
for an amount in cash equal to its pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days
prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable. As a result, such shares of
Class A common stock are recorded at redemption amount and classified as temporary equity, in accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity. The amount in the Trust Account was initially per public share of Class A common stock held in the
Trust Account divided by public shares). 

The Company has until the Extended Date (or until
June 30, 2025 if so resolved by the Company s board of directors), to complete its initial Business Combination unless stockholders
approve an extension of such date. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within this period of time, it shall (i) cease
all operations except for the purposes of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter,
redeem the public shares of Class A common stock for a per share pro rata portion of the Trust Account, including interest, but less taxes
payable (less up to of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses) and (iii) as promptly as possible following such redemption,
dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Company s net assets to its creditors and remaining stockholders, as part of its plan
of dissolution and liquidation. The Sponsor and the Company s independent directors (collectively, the initial stockholders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5); however, if the
initial stockholders or any of the Company s officers, directors or affiliates acquire shares of Class A common stock in or after
the Public Offering, they will be entitled to a pro rata share of the Trust Account upon the Company s redemption or liquidation
in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date, or such later date as may be resolved by the Company s
board of directors as permitted, or if stockholders approve an extension of such date. 

In the event of such distribution, it is
possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be
less than the price per Unit in the Public Offering.

million; and (vii) other customary closing conditions
set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. 

Unless specifically stated, this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q does not give effect to the proposed Transactions and does not contain the risks associated with the proposed Transactions.
Such risks and effects relating to the proposed Transactions will be included in a Registration Statement on Form F-4 that PubCo intends
to file with the SEC relating to the Proposed Business Combination. 

For more information about the Proposed Business
Combination and the Business Combination Agreement, see the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 18,

in cash
and approximately of negative working capital (excluding approximately of taxes payable that will be paid from interest
income earned on assets held in the Trust Account) at September 30, 2024. Further, the Company has segregated approximately of
cash for the payment of excise taxes on the redemptions of Class A common stock in connection with the 2023 Extension Meeting. Further,
the Company is incurring, and expects to continue to incur, significant costs in the pursuit of an initial business combination. These
conditions indicate that the Company needs additional working capital. In addition, if the Company cannot complete a Business Combination
before the Extended Date, March 31, 2025 (or June 30, 2025 if extended as permitted by the board of directors), or such later date
if stockholders approve an extension of such date, it could be forced to wind up its operations and liquidate unless it receives an extension
approval from its stockholders. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for a period of time within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. The Company s
plan to deal with this uncertainty is to complete a Business Combination prior to the Extended Date, or such later date up to June 30,
2025, as may be resolved by the Company s board of directors, or if stockholders approve an extension of such date, to receive working
capital from its Sponsor and/or external financing sources to the extent necessary and to work with creditors to defer payments. There
is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination, work with creditors to defer payments and continue
to receive loans, if available, from its Sponsor and/or external financing sources will be successful or successful within the required
timeframe. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

and , respectively, and during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of approximately and , respectively. The tax provision
results from taxable interest income earned on the Trust Account, which was partially offset by deductible franchise taxes. The Company s
effective tax rate for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately and , respectively, and for nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the effective tax rate was approximately and , respectively. The effective tax rates differ from
the expected income tax rate primarily due to substantial non-deductible income or expense from warrant fair value adjustments, subscription
agreement fair value adjustments and the estimated fair-value of Founder Shares provided in non-redemption agreements, as well as by the
start-up costs (discussed above) which are not currently deductible and business combination costs which may not be deductible or taxable.
At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has a gross deferred tax asset of approximately and , respectively,
primarily related to start-up and business combination costs. Management has determined that a full valuation allowance of the deferred
tax asset is appropriate at this time. 

public
shares sold as part of Units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of public shares if the
Company holds a stockholder vote or there is a tender offer for shares in connection with a Business Combination. In accordance with FASB

per unit (the Units ). par value and
one-third of one redeemable warrant (the Warrants ). Each whole Warrant offered in the Public Offering is exercisable to
purchase one share of Class A common stock at per share, subject to adjustment (Note 7). 

The Company granted the underwriters a -day option
to purchase up to additional Units to cover any over-allotments, at the Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts
and commissions. On October 21, 2021, the underwriters exercised their option with respect to Units. The Warrants issued
in connection with over-allotment Units are identical to the Public Warrants and have no net cash settlement provisions. 

The Company paid an underwriting discount of 
of the per Unit price to the underwriters at the closing of the Public Offering and over-allotment option exercise (an aggregate of approximately), with an additional fee (the Deferred Discount of (an aggregate of approximately of the gross
offering proceeds payable upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination. The Deferred Discount will become payable to the
underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event the Company completes its initial Business Combination. During
the year ended December 31, 2023, underwriters representing all of the approximately of deferred underwriting compensation
agreed to waive their right to such compensation. As such, this amount was credited to Class A common stock subject to possible redemption. 

The Company intends to finance a Business Combination
with proceeds of approximately (before redemptions in September 2023, January 2024 and September 30, 2024 discussed below)
from the Public Offering and from the private placement (Note 5), net of expenses of the offering and amounts allocated to
working capital. Upon the closing of the Public Offering, the over-allotment option and the Private Placement, approximately 
was deposited in the Trust Account. 

In July and August 2021, the Company entered into
subscription agreements with the Direct Anchor Investors (as defined below) and the Other Anchor Investors (as defined below) to purchase
 Private Placement Warrants at per Warrant. The Direct Anchor Investors, the Other Anchor Investors and one strategic investment
fund that is focused on end markets similar to those on which the Company intends to concentrate (collectively, the Anchor Investors also purchased an aggregate of million of Units in the Public Offering. The Anchor Investors are also entitled to purchase from
the Sponsor, upon consummation of the initial Business Combination and subject to certain conditions, an aggregate of up to of the
number of Founder Shares outstanding upon closing of the Public Offering, at a purchase price of approximately per share. 

As indicated in Notes 1 and 3, in connection with
the 2023 Extension Amendment, holders of shares of Class A common stock elected to redeem their shares and as such approximately
 was removed from the Trust Account in 2023 to pay such redemptions. Further, and also as indicated in Notes 1 and 3, holders
of and shares, respectively, of Class A common stock elected to redeem their shares in January 2024 and September
30, 2024, in connection with the 2024 Extension Amendments, and as such approximately and , respectively, was
removed from the Trust Account in 2024 (including that was payable at September 30, 2024 and was paid in October 2024) to
pay such redemptions.

shares of Class B common stock (the Founder Shares for , or approximately per share (up to of which
were subject to forfeiture to the extent the underwriters over-allotment option was not exercised in full). In March and September
2021, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of Founder Shares to the Company s independent directors. In March 2021, the
Company effected a stock dividend of of a Founder Share for each outstanding Founder Share, and in September 2021, the Company
effected a second stock dividend of Founder Share for each outstanding Founder Share, which stock dividends resulted in the Sponsor
and the Company s independent directors holding an aggregate of Founder Shares (up to of which were subject
to forfeiture by the Sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters option to purchase additional Units was exercised).
The share and per share amounts related to the stock dividend have been retroactively restated in the accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements. The Founder Shares are identical to the Class A common stock included in the Units sold in the Public Offering,
except that the Founder Shares automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of the initial Business Combination
and are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below. The Sponsor agreed to forfeit up to Founder
Shares to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters. The forfeiture was to be adjusted to
the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the initial stockholders would own 
of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Public Offering. The underwriters exercised their over-allotment
in part, and therefore Founder Shares were forfeited by the Sponsor. 

The Company s initial stockholders have agreed
not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of the Company s
initial Business Combination, or (B) subsequent to the Company s initial Business Combination, if (x) the last reported sale price
of the Company s Class A common stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations,
recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Company s
initial Business Combination or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction
after the initial Business Combination that results in all of the Company s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares
of common stock for cash, securities or other property. 

Private Placement Warrants 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering
on October 1, 2021 and the partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option on October 21, 2021, the Sponsor and certain
funds and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc., Arena Capital Advisors, LLC, for and on behalf of the funds and accounts
it manages, D. E. Shaw Valence Investments (Cayman) Limited and D. E. Shaw Valence Portfolios, L.L.C., certain funds managed by affiliates
of Apollo Global Management, Inc., certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC and Antara Capital Total Return SPAC Master
Fund LP (collectively, the Direct Anchor Investors ), and four other unaffiliated qualified institutional buyers or institutional
accredited investors, on behalf of one or more funds that they advise or manage (collectively, the Other Anchor Investors ),
purchased from the Company in a private placement an aggregate of Warrants at a price of per warrant (an aggregate purchase
price of approximately ). The Sponsor purchased Private Placement Warrants and the Direct Anchor Investors and Other
Anchor Investors purchased an aggregate of Private Placement Warrants. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder to
purchase one share of Class A common stock at per share. A portion of the purchase price of the Private Placement Warrants was
added to the proceeds from the Public Offering and deposited in the Trust Account pending completion of the Company s initial Business
Combination. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units sold as part of the Units in the Public
Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by the Sponsor, the Direct Anchor Investors, the Other
Anchor Investors or their respective permitted transferees, (i) will not be redeemable by the Company (except if the Reference Value is
less than per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations
and the like), in which case the Private Placement Warrants must also concurrently be called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding
Warrants), (ii) may not (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of such Private Placement Warrants),
subject to certain limited exceptions as described in the Registration Statement, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after
the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, (iii) may be exercised on a cashless basis and (iv) the holders thereof
(including with respect to the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such Private Placement Warrants) are entitled
to registration rights. Otherwise, the Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Warrants
being sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering and have no net cash settlement provisions. 

If the Company does not complete a Business Combination,
then the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants deposited in the Trust Account will be part of the liquidating distribution
to the public stockholders and the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor, the Direct Anchor Investors and the Other Investors
will expire worthless.

of such loans may be converted into Warrants,
at the price of per warrant, at the option of the lender. Such Warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In
June 2023, the Sponsor loaned to the Company. Such loan bears no interest and may be converted to Warrants at the option
of the lender as described above. The Company has determined that the value of the conversion feature is immaterial at September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023 and therefore the loan has been recorded at par value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was
 outstanding at each date under the working capital loan.

are substantially similar to the Public Warrants but do not trade, the Company valued them based on the value of the Public Warrants (significant
other observable inputs - Level 2). 

The derivative warrant liabilities are not subject
to qualified hedge accounting. 

Public Warrants 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there
were Public Warrants outstanding. Each whole Warrant offered in the Public Offering is exercisable to purchase one share of
Class A common stock. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to file a new
registration statement under the Securities Act, following the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination. No fractional
Warrants have been or will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Warrants trade. Each Warrant will become exercisable
on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering; provided
in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Class A common stock
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise
their Warrants on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act). The Company has agreed
that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the shares of Class A
common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock
until the Warrants expire or are redeemed. If a registration statement covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the
Warrants is not effective by the 60 th business day after the closing of the initial Business Combination, Warrant holders may,
until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an
effective registration statement, exercise Warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company s shares of Class A common stock are at the time of any exercise
of a Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under
Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Warrants who exercise their Warrants to do
so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects,
it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will
use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 

The Warrants have an exercise price of per
share, subject to adjustments, and expire after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Company s initial stockholders or their affiliates or the Anchor Investors
(as defined below), without taking into account any Founder Shares or Warrants held by the Company s initial stockholders or such
affiliates, as applicable, or the Anchor Investors, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y)

Value and the Newly Issued Price, the per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to
 of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted

their Warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to an agreed table based
on the redemption date and the fair market value of the shares of Class A common stock; 

if,
and only if, the closing price of the shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds per public share (as adjusted) on the trading
day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the Warrant holders; and 

if
the Reference Value is less than per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations,
recapitalizations and the like), then the Private Placement Warrants must also concurrently be called for redemption on the same terms
(except as described herein with respect to a holder s ability to cashless exercise its Warrants) as the outstanding Warrants. 

In no event will the Company be required to net
cash settle any Warrant. f the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination prior to the Extended Date, or such later
date up to June 30, 2025 as may be resolved by the Company s board of directors, or if stockholders approve and extension of such
date, and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect
to their Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect
to such Warrants. Accordingly, the Warrants may expire worthless.

Agreement was at issuance and at December 31, 2023. The estimated fair value at issuance and December 31, 2023, was determined
by summing (1) the future cash payment discounted at a risk-adjusted discount rate, which is an income approach, and (2) shares of
Common Stock for each dollar of the 2023 Capital Contribution valued using the closing stock price, then adjusting such amount by the
probability of an initial Business Combination. The significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 measurements, at the date of issuance

parties entered into amendments to the subscription agreements executed with the Anchor Investors in connection with the IPO and
the 2023 Non-Redemption Agreements and the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements, respectively, which amendments amend the amount of Founder
Shares the Anchor Investors and the investors parties will purchase or receive, as applicable, from the Sponsor at the Closing. Certain
of the Founder Shares to be purchased will be tied to the Sponsor earnout as set forth in the Sponsor Letter Agreement, by and among the

closing of the Business Combination.

of the Business Combination) be required to increase the authorized number of shares at the same time as its stockholders vote on the
Business Combination to the extent the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with its initial Business Combination. Holders
of the Company s Class A and Class B common stock vote together as a single class and are entitled to vote for each share of

effected a stock dividend of of Founder Share for each outstanding Founder Share, and the Company effected a second stock dividend
of Founder Share for each outstanding Founder Share in September 2021, which stock dividends resulted in the Sponsor and the Company s
independent directors holding an aggregate of shares of Class B common stock (up to of which were subject to forfeiture
by the Sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters option to purchase additional Units was exercised). Because the
underwriters exercised their over-allotment in part, shares of Class B common stock were forfeited by the Sponsor leaving
 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all

for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account and such shares were redeemed in October 2023. Further, and also as indicated
in Notes 1, 3 and 4, in connection with the 2024 Extension Amendments, holders of and shares, respectively, of Class
A common stock elected to redeem their shares in January 2024 and September 30, 2024, and as such shares were redeemed in January 2024

the 2023 Extension Meeting. 

The Company has estimated, with the assistance
of valuation professionals, the aggregate fair value of Founder Shares to be transferred pursuant to the 2023 Non-Redemption
Agreements to be approximately per Founder Share. The estimated fair value, approximately , was determined to be a deemed
contribution to the capital of the Company from the Sponsor in the statements of stockholders deficit in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB Topic 5T, and a business combination cost in the statement of operations. Pursuant to the 2023
Non-Redemption Agreements, the Company agreed not to satisfy any of its excise tax obligations from the interest earned on the funds in

Preferred Stock 

The Company is authorized to issue shares
of preferred stock, par value , with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time
to time by the Company s board of directors. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no shares of preferred stock
issued or outstanding.

excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations, among others.
The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of
the excise tax is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes
of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against
the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. Any
redemption or other repurchase that occurs on or after January 1, 2023, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote
or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection
with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value
of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of the
Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with the Business
Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of the Business
Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would
be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined.
The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability
to complete a Business Combination. The Company has agreed that any such excise taxes shall not be paid from the interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account. 

As discussed in Note 1 and elsewhere, during September
2023, holders of shares of Class A common Stock elected to redeem their shares in connection with the 2023 Extension
Meeting. As a result, approximately was removed from the Company s Trust Account to pay such holders. Management
has evaluated the requirements of the IR Act and the Company s operations, and has recorded a liability of approximately 
as of September 30, 2024. This liability was recorded as a reduction to accumulated deficit as it is related to the capital stock of the
Company. This liability will be reevaluated and remeasured at the end of such subsequent period until it is settled. 

Management is continuing to evaluate the requirements
of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Company s operations with respect to the January 2024 and September 30, 2024 redemptions
and has concluded that substantial uncertainties exist as to whether such redemptions would result in additional liability at September
30, 2024. As such no amount of potential additionally liability, which could potentially be material, has been recorded at this time.

regulation or prevailing market interest rates and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak
of other infectious diseases);

our
pool of prospective target businesses, including the location and industry of such target businesses; 

the
ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential business combination opportunities;

Overview 

We are an early-stage blank check company incorporated
on January 22, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. As discussed below under Recent Events, on
June 17, 2024 we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as defined below). We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination
using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, each of which entitles the
holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at 11.50 per share (the Private Placement Warrants ), our capital
stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

The issuance of additional shares of our common
or preferred stock in our initial Business Combination: 

may
significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our initial public offering; 

may
subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock; 

could
cause a change of control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our
ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers
and directors; and 

may
adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock and/or Public Warrants. 

27 

Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise
incur significant indebtedness to finance our initial Business Combination, it could result in: 

default
and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration
of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants
that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our
immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand; 

our
inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while
the debt is outstanding; 

our
inability to pay dividends on our common stock; 

using
a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends
on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

limitations
on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased
vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations
on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of
our strategy and other purposes; and 

other
disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

The Company had approximately 890,000 in cash
and approximately 17,626,000 of negative working capital (excluding approximately 243,000 of taxes payable that will be paid from interest
income earned on assets held in the Trust Account) at September 30, 2024. Further, the Company has segregated approximately 861,000 of
cash for the payment of excise taxes on the 2023 redemptions of Class A common stock. Further, we are incurring, and expect to continue
to incur, significant costs in the pursuit of an initial business combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or
to complete our initial business combination will be successful.

the funds in the Trust Account. As such, in October 2023, the Company redeemed 8,295,189 shares of public shares for approximately 86,171,000,

redemptions, approximately 861,000, as of December 31, 2023. This liability is recorded as a reduction to accumulated deficit as it is
related to the capital stock of the Company. This liability will be reevaluated and remeasured at the end of such subsequent period until
it is settled. Management is continuing to evaluate the requirements of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Company s operations,
with respect to the January 2024 redemptions and has concluded that substantial uncertainties exist as to whether such redemptions would
result in additional liability at September 30, 2024 as such no amount of potential additionally liability has been recorded.

Amendment proposal is approved and effected by the Company s filing with the Secretary of the State of Delaware of a Certificate
of Amendment to the Charter. The January 2024 Non-Redemption Agreement increased the amount of funds that remain in the Trust Account
following the 2024 Extension Meeting. 

The Company has estimated, with the assistance
of valuation professionals, the aggregate fair value of 1,022,453 Founder Shares to be transferred pursuant to the January 2024 Non-Redemption
Agreements to be approximately 1.47 per Founder Share. The estimated fair value, approximately 1,500,000, was determined to be a deemed
contribution to the capital of the Company from the Sponsor in the statements of stockholders deficit in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB Topic 5T, and a business combination cost in the statement of operations. Pursuant to the 2024
Non-Redemption Agreements, the Company agreed not to satisfy any of its excise tax obligations from the interest earned on the funds in
the Trust Account. 

September 2024 Redemption Agreements - In
September 2024, the Company and its Sponsor entered into agreements September 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements together with
the January 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements, the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements with nine unaffiliated third-party investors
in exchange for such investors agreeing not to redeem an aggregate of 3,238,379 shares of the Company s Class A common stock September
2024 Non-Redeemed Shares at the 2024 Extension Meeting II. In exchange for the foregoing commitment not to redeem the 2024 Non-Redeemed
Shares II, the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to such investors an aggregate of 809,594 Founder Shares held by the Sponsor, promptly following
the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination if they do not exercise their redemption rights with respect to the 2024
Non-Redeemed Shares II in connection with the 2024 Extension Meeting II and that the 2024 Extension Amendment II proposal is approved
and effected by the Company s filing with the Secretary of the State of Delaware of a Certificate of Amendment to the Charter. The
September 2024 Non-Redemption Agreement increased the amount of funds that remain in the Trust Account following the 2024 Extension Meeting
II. 

The Company has estimated, with the assistance
of valuation professionals, the aggregate fair value of 809,594 Founder Shares to be transferred pursuant to the September 2024 Non-Redemption
Agreements to be approximately 8.11 per Founder Share. The estimated fair value, approximately 6,670,000, was determined to be a deemed
contribution to the capital of the Company from the Sponsor in the statements of stockholders deficit in accordance with SAB Topic
5T, and a business combination cost in the statement of operations. Pursuant to the September 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements, the Company
agreed not to satisfy any of its excise tax obligations from the interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account.

Subscription Agreements 

On October 13, 2023, the Company entered into a
subscription agreement (the Polar Subscription Agreement I with HCG, the Sponsor and Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund Polar ),
pursuant to which Polar agreed to make a 900,000 cash contribution to the Company (the First Capital Contribution to cover
working capital expenses of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth therein. Pursuant to the Polar Subscription
Agreement I, the First Capital Contribution shall be repaid to Polar by the Company upon the closing of an initial Business Combination
(the Closing ). Polar may elect to receive such repayment (i) in cash or (ii) in shares of Class A common stock of the surviving
entity in such initial Business Combination (the Surviving Entity at a rate of one share of Class A common stock for each
ten dollars 10.00) of the First Capital Contribution. In consideration of the foregoing First Capital Contribution, the Company has
agreed to issue, or to cause the Surviving Entity to issue, 0.9 of a share of Class A common stock of the Surviving Entity for each dollar 1.00) of the First Capital Contribution funded as of or prior to the Closing. Pursuant to the Polar Subscription Agreement I, the Surviving
Entity shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any shares of Class A common stock issued to Polar pursuant to the Polar Subscription
Agreement I to be registered on the first registration statement filed by the Surviving Company following the Closing, which shall be
filed no later than 30 days following the Closing and declared effective no later than 90 days following the Closing. Upon certain events
of default under the Polar Subscription Agreement I or if the Surviving Entity fails to file a registration statement to register the
shares of Class A common stock issued to Polar within 30 days after the Closing and to have such registration statement declared effective
within 90 days after the Closing, the Company (or the Surviving Entity, as applicable) shall issue to Polar an additional 0.1 of a share
of Class A common stock for each dollar of the First Capital Contribution funded as of the date of such default, and for each month thereafter
until such default of failure is cured, subject to certain limitations provided for therein. In the event the Company liquidates without
consummating an initial Business Combination, any amounts remaining in the Company s cash accounts (excluding the Trust Account)
will be paid to Polar by the Company within five (5) calendar days of the liquidation, and such amounts shall be the sole recourse for
Polar. 

HCG agreed to purchase from Polar, and Polar agreed
to transfer to HCG, effective upon execution of the Polar Subscription Agreement I, (i) 100,000 redeemable private placement warrants
and (2) 37.5 of Polar s right under its existing 2021 subscription agreement (entered into in connection with our initial public
offering) to purchase up to 150,000 shares of the Class B common stock from the Sponsor, for an aggregate cash purchase price of 150,000. 

On January 16, 2024, the Company entered into the
Polar Subscription Agreement II with the Sponsor and Polar pursuant to which Polar agreed to make a 1,750,000 cash contribution to the
Company (the Second Capital Contribution to cover working capital expenses and certain potential excise tax obligations
of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth therein. Pursuant to the Polar Subscription Agreement II, the Second
Capital Contribution shall be repaid to Polar by the Company upon the Closing. Polar may elect to receive such repayment (i) in cash or
(ii) in shares of Class A common stock of the Surviving Entity at a rate of one share of Class A common stock for each ten dollars 10.00)
of the Second Capital Contribution. In consideration of the foregoing Second Capital Contribution, the Company has agreed to issue, or
to cause the Surviving Entity to issue, 70,000 shares of Class A common stock of the Surviving Entity (the Subscription Shares to Polar as of or prior to the Closing. Pursuant to the Polar Subscription Agreement II, the Surviving Entity shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Subscription Shares issued to Polar pursuant to the Polar Subscription Agreement II to be registered on the
first registration statement filed by the Surviving Company following the Closing, which shall be filed no later than 30 days following
the Closing and declared effective no later than 90 days following the Closing. Upon certain events of default under the Polar Subscription
Agreement II or if the Surviving Entity fails to file a registration statement to register the Subscription Shares issued to Polar within
30 days after the Closing and to have such registration statement declared effective within 90 days after the Closing, the Company (or
the Surviving Entity, as applicable) shall issue to Polar an additional 0.1 of a share of Class A common stock for each one dollar 1.00)
of the Second Capital Contribution funded as of the date of such default, and for each month thereafter until such default of failure
is cured, subject to certain limitations provided for therein. In the event the Company (1) liquidates without consummating an initial
business combination or (2) consummates an initial business combination, the Company shall repay the Second Capital Contribution within
30 calendar days of the liquidation or within five (5) business days of the Closing (as applicable, the Specified Period ).
In the event that such Second Capital Contribution is not repaid in full within the Specified Period, Daniel J. Hennessy, our Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, has agreed (in his individual capacity) to purchase from Polar all of Polar s remaining rights under
the Polar Subscription Agreement II (excluding the right to receive the Subscription Shares, which shall remain with Polar) for a cash
amount equal to the portion of the Second Capital Contribution not repaid by the Company. 

On April 1, 2024, the Company received proceeds
of 1,750,000 under the Polar Subscription Agreement II. 

32 

The Company elected the fair value option to account
for amounts received from the Polar Subscription Agreement I and Polar Subscription Agreement II. As a result of applying the fair value
option, the Company recognizes the amounts received at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as a change in fair
value in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value is based on prices or valuation techniques that require significant
inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management s own estimates
about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the liability. 

The estimated fair value of the Polar Subscription
Agreement I was 7,302,000 at September 30, 2024 (an increase of 3,504,000 in the three months then ended), was determined by summing
(1) the future cash payment discounted at a risk-adjusted discount rate, which is an income approach, and (2) 0.9 shares of Common Stock
for each dollar of the 2023 Capital Contribution valued using the closing stock price, then adjusting such amount by the probability of
an initial Business Combination. The significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 measurements, at September 30, 2024, included the probability
of an initial Business Combination closing of 70 . 

The estimated fair value of the Polar Subscription
Agreement II would have been approximately 1,750,000 upon subscription at January 10, 2024 if it had been drawn down at that date and
it was approximately 2,004,000 at September 30, 2024. The subscription was funded on April 1, 2024. The estimated fair value of the Polar
Subscription Agreement II was approximately 2,486,000 at September 30, 2024 (an increase of approximately 482,000 during the three months
then ended). The significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 measurements, at September 30, 2024 included the risk-adjusted discount rate
of 10 and probability of business combination closing of 70 . 

Amendment to Subscription Agreements and the Non-Redemption Agreement 

In connection with entry of the Business Combination
Agreement, the Company, beginning in June 2024 and continuing through the second half of 2024, the Sponsor and certain of the Anchor Investors
and the investors parties to the 2023 Non-Redemption Agreements and the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements (collectively, the investor
parties entered into amendments to the subscription agreements executed with the Anchor Investors in connection with the IPO and
the 2023 Non-Redemption Agreements and the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements, respectively, which amendments amend the amount of Founder
Shares the Anchor Investors and the investors parties will purchase or receive, as applicable, from the Sponsor at the Closing. Certain
of the Founder Shares to be purchased will be tied to the Sponsor earnout as set forth in the Sponsor Letter Agreement, by and among the
Company, the Sponsor and PubCo, dated June 18, 2024. Further, the amendments also provide that the Anchor Investors and the investors
parties will enter into a registration rights and lock-up agreement, in the form included to the Business Combination Agreement, upon
closing of the Business Combination. 

Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated
any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for and consummate
our initial public offering and, subsequent to completion of our initial public offering on October 1, 2021, identifying and completing
a suitable initial Business Combination. Following our initial public offering, we do not and will not generate any operating revenues
until after completion of our initial Business Combination, if at all. We currently generate non-operating income in the form of interest
income on cash and investments after our initial public offering. Since our initial public offering, we have incurred increased expenses
as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for professional
and consulting fees and travel associated with evaluating various initial Business Combination candidates, as well as costs in connection
with negotiating and executing a definitive agreement and related agreements and proxy materials. Our expenses have increased, and will
likely continue to increase, substantially since the closing of our initial public offering on October 1, 2021. 

We account for the Public Warrants and Private
Placement Warrants issued in connection with our initial public offering as warrant liabilities and not equity. As a result, we are required
to measure the fair value of the Warrants when they are issued and then at the end of each reporting period and to recognize changes in
the fair value from the prior period in our operating results for each current period. Such amounts can be material and can be either
other income or other expense. We account for all of the Class A common stock issued in our initial public offering as redeemable stock
and not permanent equity and so we report negative stockholders deficit and expect to continue to do so.

The Company elected the fair value option to account
for amounts received from the Polar Subscription Agreement I and Polar Subscription Agreement II. As a result of applying the fair value
option, the Company recognizes the amounts received at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as a change in fair
value in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value is based on prices or valuation techniques that require significant
inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management s own estimates
about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the liability. 

The Company accounts for the aggregate fair value
of founder shares to be transferred pursuant to the 2023 Non-Redemption Agreements and the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements as a deemed
contribution to the capital of the Company from its Sponsor in the unaudited condensed statements of stockholders equity in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB Topic 5T, and as a business combination cost in the unaudited statement of operations. 

General and administrative expenses 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a loss from operations of approximately 7,980,00 and 13,804,000,
respectively, consisting of the estimated fair value of Founders Shares provided as compensation to investors for entering into the 2024
Non Redemption Agreements of approximately 6,670,000 and 8,170,000, respectively, as well as the costs of being a public company of
approximately 381,000 and 917,000, respectively (including approximately proxy-related costs in the three and nine months), compensation
of approximately 54,000 and 378,000, respectively (approximately 27,000 and 186,000, respectively, of which is deferred), approximately
 50,000 and 150,000, respectively, of franchise taxes, approximately 45,000 and 135,000, respectively, of administrative fees to our
Sponsor, and approximately 777,000 and 4,050,000, respectively, of costs associated with our business combination and other costs. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, we had a loss from operations of approximately 2,760,000 and 5,978,000, respectively, consisting primarily of costs associated
with the estimated fair value of Founder Shares provided as compensation to investors for entering into the 2023 Non-Redemption Agreements
of approximately 1,825,000 in both periods, costs for being a public company of approximately 260,000 and 626,000, respectively (including
proxy-related costs in the nine months), compensation of approximately 220,000 and 718,000, respectively (approximately 107,000 and
 351,000 of which is deferred), approximately 50,000 and 150,000, respectively, of franchise taxes, approximately 45,000 and 135,000,
respectively, of administrative fees to our Sponsor, and approximately 340,000 and 2,405,000, respectively, of costs associated with
searching for a suitable business combination and other costs. 

Other income (expense) In addition
to operating costs, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had other expense consisting of the following item: the
costs associated with the change in fair value of both our extension notes payable (approximately 3,986,000 and 7,138,000, respectively)
and our warrant liabilities (approximately 1,487,000 of other income and 186,000 of other expense, respectively) all partially offset
by interest income of approximately 647,000 and 2,217,000 on our demand deposits in the Trust Account and our operating account. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, we had other income of approximately 3,953,000 and 11,938,000, respectively, representing interest income of approximately 4,510,000
and 12,309,000, respectively, on our investments in the Trust Account partially offset by the increase in fair value of our warrant liability
during the period of approximately 557,000 and 371,000, respectively. 

The change in the interest income is the result
of market conditions as well as significant decreases in the Trust Account due to redemptions in September 2023 and January 2024. Further
decrease is to be expected after additional redemptions of approximately 21,400,000 at September 30, 2024. 

Provision for income taxes The provision
for income taxes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 140,000 and 476,000, respectively, results from taxable interest
income offset by deductible franchise taxes. Since the Company s operating expenses are considered non-deductible start-up costs
or business combination expenses, they are not deductible for income tax purposes. Further, the change in value of our derivative warrant
liabilities and our extension notes, as well as the estimated fair value of founder shares provided in 2023 Non-Redemption Agreements
and the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements do not result in taxable income or expense. 

The provision for income taxes in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, 943,000 and 2,553,000, respectively, results from the significantly higher taxable interest income
in those periods prior to stockholder redemptions in October 2023 and January 2024. Since the Company s operating expenses are considered
non-deductible start-up costs or business combination expenses, they are not deductible for income tax purposes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity needs prior to the completion of
our initial public offering were satisfied through receipt of 25,000 from the sale of the founder shares and up to 500,000 in loans
from our Sponsor under an unsecured promissory note, 195,000 of which was borrowed prior to, and then fully repaid at, the October 1,
2021 closing of our initial public offering. The net proceeds from: (1) the sale of our units in our initial public offering (including
the additional units sold on October 21, 2021 pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option), after
deducting offering expenses of approximately 990,000 and underwriting commissions of approximately 6,819,000 (excluding total deferred
underwriting commissions of 11,933,000 at the time of our initial public offering), and (2) the sale of the Private Placement Warrants
(including the additional Private Placement Warrants sold on October 21, 2021 in connection with the partial exercise of the underwriters 
over-allotment option) for a purchase price of approximately 10,819,000, was 343,940,000. Of this amount, approximately 340,930,000,
which includes approximately 11,933,000 of total deferred underwriting commissions at the time of our initial public offering, was deposited
into the Trust Account. The remaining approximately 3,010,000 will not be held in the Trust Account. The funds in the Trust Account have
been held in an interest-bearing demand deposit account or invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days
or less or in money market funds that meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest
only in direct U.S. government obligations. 

We intend to use substantially all of the funds
held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes
payable), if any, to complete our initial Business Combination. We have made and will make withdrawals from the Trust Account to pay our
taxes, including franchise taxes and income taxes. Delaware franchise tax is based on our authorized shares or on our assumed par and
non-par capital, whichever yields a lower result. Under the authorized shares method, each share is taxed at a graduated rate based on
the number of authorized shares with a maximum aggregate tax of 200,000 per year. Under the assumed par value capital method, Delaware
taxes each 1,000,000 of assumed par value capital at the rate of 400; where assumed par value would be (1) our total gross assets divided
by (2) our total issued shares of common stock, multiplied by (3) the number of our authorized shares. Based on the number of shares of
our common stock authorized and outstanding and our total gross assets, our annual franchise tax obligation is expected to be capped at
the maximum amount of annual franchise taxes payable by us as a Delaware corporation of 200,000. Our annual income tax obligations will
depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account. We expect the only taxes payable by
us out of the funds in the Trust Account will be income and franchise taxes. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in
whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will
be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth
strategies. 

Prior to the completion of our initial Business
Combination, in addition to our costs associated with operating as a listed public company, our principal use of working capital will
be to fund our activities to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses,
travel to and from the offices or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate
documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete an initial Business Combination. 

In addition, we may pay commitment fees for financing,
fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision
(a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies or investors
on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business,
the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision would be determined based on the terms of
the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result
of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, prospective target businesses. 

In June 2023, the Sponsor loaned 200,000 to the
Company. In October 2023, Polar made a capital contribution to the Company of 900,000. In January 2024, Polar agreed to make an additional
capital contribution to the Company of 1,750,000, which contribution was made on April 1, 2024. 

35 

On September 29, 2023, in connection with the 2023
Extension Meeting, stockholders holding 8,295,189 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro
rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As such, on October 12, 2023, the Company redeemed 8,295,189 shares of Class A common
stock for approximately 86,171,000, or approximately 10.39 per share. Management has evaluated the requirements of the Inflation
Reduction Act and the Company s operations, and has an excise tax liability of 1 of the redemption amount, approximately 861,000
accrued on its unaudited condensed balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and its balance sheet at December 31, 2024. This liability was
recorded as a reduction to stockholders deficit as it is related to the capital stock of the Company. This liability will be reevaluated
and remeasured at the end of such subsequent period until it is settled. 

In January 2024, in connection with the 2024 Extension
Meeting, stockholders holding 20,528,851 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion
of the funds in the Trust Account. As such, in January 2024, the Company redeemed 20,528,851 shares of Class A common stock for approximately
 215,340,000, or approximately 10.49 per share. 

On September 30, 2024, in connection with the 2024
Extension Meeting II, stockholders holding 1,992,461 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a
pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As such, subsequent to September 30, 2024, in October 2024, the Company redeemed 1,992,461
shares of Class A common stock for approximately 21,400,000, or approximately 10.74 per share. 

Management is continuing to evaluate the requirements
of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Company s operations with respect to the January 2024 and September 2024 redemptions and
has concluded that substantial uncertainties exist as to whether such redemptions would result in additional liability at September 30,
2024. As such no amount of potential additionally liability has been recorded at this time. 

Mandatory Liquidation, Liquidity and Going Concern: 

The Company had approximately 890,000 in cash
and approximately 17,625,000 of negative working capital (excluding approximately 243,000 of taxes payable that will be paid from interest
income earned on assets held in the Trust Account) at September 30, 2024. Further, the Company has segregated approximately 861,000 of
cash for the payment of excise taxes on the 2023 redemptions of Class A common stock. Further, we are incurring, and expect to continue
to incur, significant costs in the pursuit of an initial business combination. These conditions indicate that the Company needs additional
working capital. In addition, if the Company cannot complete a Business Combination before the Extended Date, March 31, 2025 (or June
30, 2025 if the board of directors elects to further extend the Extended Date, as permitted), or such later date if stockholders approve
an extension of such date, it could be forced to wind up its operations and liquidate unless it receives an extension approval from its
stockholders. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of
time within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. The Company s plan to deal with
this uncertainty is to complete a Business Combination prior to the Extended Date, or such later date as may be resolved by the Company s
board of directors, or if stockholders approve an extension of such date, to receive working capital from its Sponsor and/or external
financing sources to the extent necessary and to work with creditors to defer payments. There is no assurance that the Company s
plans to consummate a Business Combination, work with creditors to defer payments and continue to receive loans, if available, from its
Sponsor and/or external financing sources will be successful or successful within the required timeframe. The unaudited condensed financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital
or to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful. 

Our Sponsor, an affiliate of our Sponsor or our
officers and directors may, but none of them is obligated to, loan us funds as may be required to fund our working capital requirements.
Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into Warrants at a price of 1.50 per Warrant at the option of the lender. The Warrants
would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to our Sponsor, our direct anchor investors and our other anchor investors.
The terms of such loans by our Sponsor, an affiliate of our Sponsor or our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and
no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. In June 2023, the Sponsor loaned 200,000 to the Company. Such loan bears no interest
and may be converted to 133,333 Warrants at the option of the lender as described above. The Company has determined that the fair value
of the conversion feature is immaterial and therefore the loan has been recorded at par value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, there was 200,000 and 200,000 outstanding under the working capital loan. 

36 

On October 13, 2023, the Company entered into the
Polar Subscription Agreement I with HCG, the Sponsor, and Polar, pursuant to which Polar agreed to make a 900,000, cash contribution
to the Company to cover working capital expenses of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth therein and as further
described in Recent Events Subscription Agreements above. 

On January 10, 2024, the Company entered into the
Polar Subscription Agreement II with HCG, Daniel J. Hennessy, the Sponsor, and Polar, pursuant to which Polar agreed to make a 1,750,000
cash contribution to the Company to cover working capital expenses of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
therein and as further provided in Recent Events Subscription Agreements above. 

If we complete our initial Business Combination,
we would repay amounts loaned under the Sponsor s working capital loan and return the Capital Contribution made by Polar pursuant
to the terms of the Polar Subscription Agreement I and II out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our
initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. 

We do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our Sponsor, Polar, an affiliate of our Sponsor or our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. 

If our estimates of the costs of identifying a
target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial Business Combination exceed our expectations, we may have
insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional
financing either to complete our initial Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public
shares upon completion of our initial Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection
with such initial Business Combination. In addition, we intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could
acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, and, as a result, if the
cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy redemptions by
public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial Business Combination. We may also
obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial Business Combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection
with our search for and completion of our initial Business Combination. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the
issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial Business
Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following the consummation of
our initial public offering. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously
with the completion of our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination because we do not
have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our
initial Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 

Off-balance sheet financing arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we have no obligations,
assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered into
any agreements for non-financial assets. 

37 

Contractual obligations 

At September 30, 2024, we did not have any long-term
debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. In connection with our initial public offering,
we entered into an Administrative Support Agreement with Hennessy Capital Group LLC, an affiliate of our Sponsor, pursuant to which the
Company pays Hennessy Capital Group LLC 15,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. 

In June 30, 2023, the Sponsor loaned 200,000 to
the Company. Such loan bears no interest and may be converted to 133,333 Warrants at the option of the lender as described in Liquidity
and Capital Resources Mandatory Liquidation, Liquidity and Going Concern above. 

In October 2023, the Company entered into the Polar
Subscription Agreement I with HCG, the Sponsor and Polar, pursuant to which the Company agreed to return the First Capital Contribution
to Polar. Polar may elect to receive such repayment (i) in cash or (ii) in shares of Common Stock at a rate of one share of Common Stock
for each ten dollars 10.00) of the First Capital Contribution. The Company must also issue to Polar 0.9 of a share of Common Stock for
each dollar 1.00) of the First Capital Contribution funded as of or prior to the Closing. The terms and conditions of the Subscription
Agreement are described in additional detail in Recent Events Subscription Agreements above. 

On January 16, 2024, the Company entered into the
Polar Subscription Agreement II with the Sponsor and Polar pursuant to which Polar agreed to make the Second Capital Contribution to cover
working capital expenses and certain potential excise tax obligations of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
therein. Pursuant to the Polar Subscription Agreement II, the Second Capital Contribution shall be repaid to Polar by the Company upon
Closing. Polar may elect to receive such repayment (i) in cash or (ii) in shares of Class A common stock of the Surviving Entity at a
rate of one share of Class A common stock for each ten dollars 10.00) of the Second Capital Contribution. In consideration of the foregoing
Second Capital Contribution, the Company has agreed to issue, or to cause the Surviving Entity to issue, 70,000 shares of Class A common
stock of the Surviving Entity (the Subscription Shares to Polar as of or prior to the Closing. The terms and conditions
of the Subscription Agreement are described in additional detail in Recent Events Subscription Agreements 
above. 

Also, commencing on September 29, 2021, the date
our securities were first listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, we began to compensate each of our President and Chief Operating Officer
as well as our Chief Financial Officer 29,000 per month prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination, of which 14,000
per month is payable upon the completion of our initial Business Combination and 15,000 per month was payable currently for their services.
Commencing January 1, 2022, we began compensating a Vice President of HCG, in his capacity as an independent contract service provider
to the Company, at the rate of 25,000 per month, 12,500 of which is paid currently for his services and 12,500 of which was payable
upon the closing of our initial Business Combination. An aggregate of approximately 54,000 and 378,000, respectively, was charged for
operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Deferred compensation related parties includes approximately
 1,186,000 under this obligation for the period from September 29, 2021 to September 30, 2024. 

During September 2023, payments to the Company s
Chief Operating Officer ceased in connection with his resignation as an officer (but not as a director) of the Company. During August
2024, he resigned as a director of the Company. 

During August 2024, payments to the Company s
Chief Financial Officer and to the independent contractor service provider to the Company (who is Vice President of HCG) ceased in connection
with their resignations from the Company. If such former Chief Financial Officer and independent contractor service provider provide reasonable
and timely cooperation to transfer their knowledge and duties as reasonably requested by the Company following their separation, they
will remain entitled to receive their respective previously accrued deferred compensation (approximately 476,000 and 388,000, respectively,
through September 30, 2024), payable upon closing of the Company s initial Business Combination. 

In connection with identifying an initial Business
Combination candidate and negotiating an initial Business Combination, we may enter into engagement letters or agreements with various
consultants, advisors, professionals and others in connection with an initial Business Combination. The services under these engagement
letters and agreements can be material in amount and in some instances can include contingent or success fees. Contingent or success fees
(but not deferred underwriting compensation) would be charged to operations in the quarter that our initial Business Combination is consummated.
In most instances (except with respect to our independent registered public accounting firm), these engagement letters and agreements
are expected to specifically provide that such counterparties waive their rights to seek repayment from the funds in the Trust Account.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during
the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 

In October 2023 and January 2024, the Company entered
into Polar Subscription Agreement I and Polar Subscription Agreement II for which the Company received cash contributions to the Company
of 900,000 and 1,750,000 to cover working capital expenses of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth therein.
Such contributions shall be repaid upon closing of an initial business combination and contain various conversion or share issuance opportunities
that make them complex financial instruments. The Company has adopted the fair value option in accounting for such agreements. The fair
value option requires that a valuation be made of each instrument at each reporting date. Because there are limited observable inputs,
such valuations are made using Level 3 estimates of value using unobservable inputs. Making such judgments of value is subjective and
involves professional valuation skill. Because of that, the Company engages valuation professionals to make such fair value assessments.
As such, the fair value of the Company s extension promissory notes is a critical accounting estimate. A key metric used to calculate
fair value is the probability of the closing of a business combination. Since the initial October 2023 subscription agreement this valuation
metric has varied from 9.7 at inception in October and again at December 31, 2024, then 14 at inception of the Polar Subscription Agreement
II in January 2024 and 30 at March 31, 2024, 40 at June 30, 2024 and 70 at September 30, 2024. The change from 9.7 at inception in
October 2023 to 70 at September 30, 2024 had a 6,402,000 impact (increase) on the amount initially recorded at inception 900,000)
and on the Polar Subscription Agreement II the impact (increase) on the amount initially recorded at inception 1,750,000) was approximately
 736,000. 

Management does not believe that the Company has
any other critical accounting estimates. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by
Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed
with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly
Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management
evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ),
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act.
Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the
design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls
and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design
of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

39 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

To the knowledge of our management, there is no
litigation currently pending against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

As of the date this Quarterly Report, except as detailed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. Any of these factors could result
in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently
known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such
risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange,
which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 

Our securities are currently listed on Nasdaq. However,
we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial Business Combination.
In order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial Business Combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution
and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders equity (generally 2,500,000) and a minimum
number of holders of our securities (300 round-lot holders). Additionally, in connection with our initial Business Combination, We will
be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq s continued
listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. For instance, our stock price would generally
be required to be at least 4.00 per share, our stockholders equity would generally be required to be at least 4.0 million and
we would be required to have a minimum of 300 round lot holders of our securities. We cannot assure you that it will be able to meet those
initial listing requirements at that time. 

On October 1, 2024, we received a notice from the
staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that, unless we timely requested a hearing before the Panel ,
our securities would be subject to suspension and delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market due to our non-compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2,
which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness
of its IPO registration statement. We timely requested a hearing before the Panel to request additional time to complete the Business
Combination. The hearing request resulted in a stay of any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing, which is scheduled for
November 19, 2024. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for an extension or continued listing on Nasdaq or
that the extension, if grated, will provide us with sufficient time to complete the Business Combination. 

If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on
its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted
on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including (i) limited availability
of market quotations for our securities, (ii) reduced liquidity for our securities, (iii) a determination that our common stock is a penny
stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced
level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities, (iv) a limited amount of news and analyst coverage in the
future; (iv) institutional investors losing interest in our securities; (v) subjection to stockholder litigation and (vi) a decreased
ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

Unless specifically stated, this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q does not give effect to the proposed Transactions and does not contain the risks associated with the proposed Transactions.
Such risks and effects relating to the proposed Transactions will be included in a Registration Statement on Form F-4 that PubCo intends
to file with the SEC relating to the Proposed Business Combination.

by each party, the Company and Executive agree as follows.

such resignation(s). Notwithstanding the Separation Date, Executive agrees that he shall thereafter provide, upon timely notice, reasonable
and timely cooperation to transfer his knowledge and duties as reasonably requested by the Company, which, for the avoidance of doubt,
may include meeting with the Company (videoconference), participating in phone calls, providing summaries of open matters as of August
1, 2024 (including providing oral summaries, and, if reasonably necessary, written summaries), locating and (if reasonably necessary)
organizing files, and similar matters as the Company may reasonably request from time to time (all of the foregoing, the Transition
Obligations through September 30, 2024, subject to the Company accommodating Executive s other business and personal
commitments. For the avoidance of doubt, Executive acknowledges that he shall not be entitled to any payment in relation to the time period
after July 31, 2024. 

2. Deferred

1 

3. Release

asserted, foreseen or unforeseen, that Executive ever had or may presently have against the Company or any of the Released Parties arising
from the beginning of time up to and including the date of this Agreement, including, without limitation, all matters in any way related,
directly or indirectly, to Executive s services to the Company, and including claims based on any federal, state, or local statute,
regulation, ordinance, or order, or pursuant to any common law tort or other cause of action. Executive expressly waives the benefits
of any statute or rule of law which, if applied to this Agreement, would otherwise exclude from its binding effect any claims against
the Company or any Released Parties not now known by Executive to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that Executive
is not releasing: (a) any obligations owing to him under this Agreement (including those for deferred compensation); (b) any claim that
cannot be released as a matter of law; (c) his rights to indemnification and/or advancement as an officer in respect of any claim or other
indemnifiable matter that is first asserted, if ever, against Executive after the date hereof; or (d) his rights to any available D O
insurance coverage with respect to any other third-party claims. For the avoidance of doubt, Executive acknowledges that the foregoing
waiver and release includes a waiver and release of any claim to indemnification or advancement that was first asserted, if ever, against
Executive prior to the date hereof. Executive represents and warrants that he has made no assignment or transfer of any claims covered
by this Section 3. 

4. Release
by the Company . By the Company s signature below, in consideration of Executive s promises set forth in this Agreement,
the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors and assigns, hereby releases and forever discharges Executive, his heirs,
representatives, affiliates, successors, and assigns and any entities controlled by or affiliated with him, of and from any and all claims,
causes of action, lawsuits, liabilities, debts, accounts, dues, reckonings, bonds, bills, covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements,
promises, variances, trespasses, extents, executions, sums of money, damages, judgments, and demands of any nature whatsoever, in law
or in equity, both known and unknown, asserted or not asserted, foreseen or unforeseen, that the Company, including its successors and
assigns, ever had or may presently have, arising from the beginning of time up to and including the date of this Agreement. The Company
represents and warrants that it has made no assignment or transfer of any claims covered by this Section 4. 

5. Confidentiality .
To the extent bound by law, Executive agrees that he will use reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the Company s
confidential information, subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement. 

6. Confidentiality
Exceptions . Executive acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement or in any agreement between him and the Company prohibits
or limits him (or his attorney) from initiating communications directly with, responding to any inquiry from, volunteering information
to, or providing testimony before, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Department of Justice, FINRA, any other self-regulatory
organization, or any other governmental, law enforcement, or regulatory authority, regarding this Agreement and its underlying facts and
circumstances, or any reporting of, investigation into, or proceeding regarding suspected violations of law, and that he is not required
to advise or seek permission from the Company before or after engaging in any such activity. Executive further acknowledges that, in connection
with any such activity, he must inform such authority of the confidential nature of any confidential information that he provides, and
that he is not permitted to disclose any information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege or any other privilege belonging
to the Company, as the Company does not waive and intends to preserve such privileges. Executive is hereby notified that, pursuant to
federal law (the Defend Trade Secrets Act), an individual, shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade
secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is (i) made in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either
directly or indirectly, or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) made
in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal. 

2 

7. Non-Disparagement .
Subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement, Executive agrees that he shall not make any remark, comment or statement
(whether written, oral or electronic/digital) that is intended to or is reasonably likely to disparage, slander or otherwise damage the
business reputation of the Company, any of the other Released Parties or any of their respective directors, members, board members, officers
or employees. The Company agrees that its directors and officers shall not make any remark, comment or statement (whether written, oral
or electronic/digital) that is intended to or is reasonably likely to disparage, slander or otherwise damage the business reputation of
Executive, and, further, that the Company shall not issue any press release or other official statement disparaging Executive. 

8. Return
of Company Property . Executive represents, after a diligent inquiry, he believes that he has returned (or otherwise eliminated
his access to) all of the Company s property in his possession, including, without limitation, any electronically-stored information
or data, reports, customer lists, files, memoranda, records, credit cards, keys, passwords, computers, software, telecommunication equipment,
and other physical or personal property that he received, prepared, or helped prepare in connection with his service to the Company. Executive
agrees that, in the event that Executive subsequently discovers any Company property in Executive s possession, Executive shall
promptly return such property to the Company (or its designee). 

9. Cooperation .
Executive agrees to make himself reasonably available to, and to cooperate with the Company in, any administrative, regulatory, or judicial
proceeding or arbitration. Executive understands and agrees that his reasonable cooperation includes, but is not limited to, making himself
available to the Company upon reasonable notice for interviews and factual investigations; volunteering to the Company pertinent information;
and turning over all relevant documents which are or may come into his possession. The term cooperation does not mean that
Executive must provide information that is favorable to the Company; it means only that Executive will provide truthful information within
his knowledge and possession upon request of the Company. Executive understands that, in the event the Company asks for his cooperation
in accordance with this provision, the Company will reimburse him for reasonable travel expenses provided that Executive submits to the
Company appropriate documentation of such expenses within thirty (30) calendar days after such expenses are incurred (provided that such
proceeding was not initiated by Executive and does not otherwise concern any claims by Executive against the Company or the Released Parties). 

3 

10. Arbitration .
Executive and the Company agree that any dispute or controversy between the parties in any way arising out of, related to, or connected
with this Agreement, including to enforce its terms, or Executive s engagement by the Company shall be resolved through final and
binding arbitration before a single arbitrator exclusively through JAMS in New York, New York, pursuant to the Comprehensive Arbitration
Rules Procedures administered by JAMS; provided, however , that the foregoing shall not apply to any claims that are not arbitrable
pursuant to any statute, rule or regulation forbidding pre-dispute arbitration agreements with respect to such claims. Each party shall
bear its own expenses, including attorneys fees and expert witness fees. The costs of such arbitration, including the arbitrator s
fees, shall be allocated in the manner determined by the arbitrator, except that the Company will pay any costs unique to the arbitration
hearing as may be required by applicable law. The arbitration proceeding shall be deemed to be an arbitration proceeding specifically
enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act and any other applicable law. The award of the arbitrators may be enforced in any court
having competent jurisdiction. 

11. 409A .
It is intended that any amounts payable under this Agreement will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and the treasury regulations relating thereto, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed accordingly.
Any reimbursement payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall in no event be paid later than the last day of the calendar year
