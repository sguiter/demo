Due to historical losses in the U.S., the Company has a full valuation allowance on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. Management continues to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance. If management s assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change, the Company would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which management makes the determination.

At the inception of each lease, the Company determines if the arrangement is a lease or contains an embedded lease and reviews the facts and circumstances of the arrangement to classify leased assets as operating or finance under Topic 842. The Company has elected not to record any leases with terms of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. As this time, a certain portion of active leases within the Company portfolio are classified as operating leases under the new standard. Operating leases are included in Rights-of-Use ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make minimum lease payment arising from the lease for the duration of the lease term. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from to or greater. The exercise of the lease renewal option is typically at our discretion. Additionally, many leases contain early termination clauses, however early termination typically requires the agreement of both parties to the lease. At the lease inception, all renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised are considered when determining the lease term. At this time, the Company does not have operating leases that include options to purchase or automatically transfer ownership of the lease property to the Company. The depreciable life of leased assets is limited by the expected lease term. To determine the present value of future minimum lease payments, the Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. At this time, many of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, therefore, to determine the present value of minimum lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date. The ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives.

These capital commitments were solely related to contracts signed with vendors for procurement of services or photovoltaic (PV) related products used for the construction of solar PV systems being developed by the Company. The capital commitments as at balance sheet date disclosed above do not include those incomplete purchases or acquisitions as at balance sheet dates as the agreements could either be terminated unconditionally without any penalty or cancelable when the closing conditions as specified in the agreements could not be met. Legal matters In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. The Company records contingent liabilities resulting from such claims, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company is a party to legal matters and claims in the normal course of its operations. While the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, the outcome of these matters is not determinable with certainty and negative outcomes may adversely affect the Company.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 1, 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K ), and related management s discussion and analysis in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward- looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please also see the section herein titled Forward-Looking Statements. Overview In the third quarter of 2024, we executed on our bottom-line focus, achieving solid profitability despite softer-than-anticipated revenue resulting from delays in closing scheduled project sales. With 12.9 million in revenue during the third quarter of 2024, we still achieved a gross profit of 5.6 million, yielding a solid gross margin of 43.8 , 2.1 million in operating profit and 4.8 million in net income attributed to Emeren Group Ltd. Net income attributed to Emeren Group Ltd was supported by a foreign exchange gain of 4.6 million as the Euro strengthened during the quarter, offsetting a similar foreign exchange loss earlier in the year. We are positioned to regularly benefit from Euro strength, with our business in Europe currently generating a large portion of our revenue. Our focus on high-margin growth remains robust. The Independent Power Production (IPP) segment generated 9.4 million in revenue and 5.4 million in gross profit, driven by seasonal strength by our European and China IPP assets. Our Development Service Agreement (DSA) model also expanded in key markets, adding revenue of 1.3 million from Italy. Also, 1.0 million from France and 0.9 million from our first Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project in the U.S. were added to revenue. Total revenue was lower than anticipated due to timing issues, particularly delays in government approvals for three projects in Europe. These remain in our project pipeline and are expected to contribute to revenue once approvals are secured. An overview of each of our business lines is discussed below: DSA and BESS In the third quarter of 2024, we executed a 394 MW BESS DSA with PLT energia Srl and completed the sale of 57 MW solar projects to Trina Solar through a mixed DSA structure. Our DSA approach has proven to be a reliable and scalable business model, enabling us to monetize projects at earlier stages while securing high-quality contracted revenue. This strategic model plays a crucial role in mitigating risks and enhancing cash flow across the project lifecycle. Building on this momentum, we achieved a significant milestone with the sale of a standalone 72 MW BESS project in California. These DSA contracts were part of the over 2 GW of DSA contracts for both PV and BESS projects under negotiation. We anticipated these contracts would close within the following six to eight months, collectively contributing approximately 100.0 million in revenue to be recognized over the next three to four years. This pipeline is expected to enhance our long-term financial stability and growth. Solar Power Project Development In the second quarter of 2024, we signed a contract to sell a 42 MWp solar project portfolio in Spain to CVE Espa a. Developed over the past few years, this portfolio is projected to generate approximately 92.8 GWh annually, offsetting nearly 20,000 tons of CO emissions each year. Additionally, we sold a 57 MWp solar project portfolio to Trina Solar, showcasing the strength of our European development efforts, in the third quarter of 2024. Due to project delays, the sales of a U.S. community solar project and key projects in Spain and Italy, did not close by the end of the third quarter of 2024. Some of the Spain project closings with CVE Espa a were delayed due to local administrative approvals. Those delayed project sales in Spain, Italy and the U.S. are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 IPP During the third quarter of 2024, our IPP assets demonstrated robust growth, contributing 73.2 of our total revenue for the period. We continued optimizing operations across our solar farms, including Branston, reinforcing the IPP segment as a cornerstone of our business model that offers a dependable,stable and predictable cash flow. Our IPP revenue remains well-balanced between Europe and China, with an emerging presence in the U.S. market. In September 2024, we grid-connected a 4.5 MW solar power plant at Luxshare iTech, a major facility of Luxshare Precision Industry Co., Ltd., and a prominent Apple supplier active in Apple s Supplier Clean Energy Program. This collaboration reflects our shared commitment to environmental responsibility and the Company s expanding renewable energy presence. By the end of the third quarter of 2024, we connected a total of 7.2 MW in solar projects across China while our 35.0 MWh battery storage portfolio fully integrated into Huaneng Power International s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) platform. Solar Industry Trends The solar industry is experiencing a strong momentum due to broader global commitment to renewable energy. This shift toward cleaner energy sources positions solar as a key part of the future energy mix. There is also growing demand for solar power to support artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain operations, as these technologies require substantial energy, and solar power is viewed as offering a scalable, cost-effective solution.

 (a) The weighted-average capacity factors can vary based on seasonality and weather. Changes in climate, geography, weather patterns, and other phenomena in the regions where we operate may significantly affect our business. As a result, our IPP electricity production and amount of electricity sold and therefore our IPP revenue tend to be higher during periods or seasons when there is more irradiation. 
 Geographical Distribution We are a solar project developer and operator and function as a pure downstream player with a pipeline of projects around the world. The following table summarizes the Company s revenues generated by the geographic location of customers:

Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue for continuing operations consists of costs for: A. development costs (including interconnection fees and permitting costs) of solar/storage power projects; B. acquisition costs of solar/storage power projects, if applicable; C. project management costs; D. EPC costs (consisting of costs of the components of solar/storage power projects other than solar modules, such as inverters, electrical and mounting hardware, trackers, grid interconnection equipment, wiring and other devices); E. interest costs capitalized for solar/storage power projects during construction period; and F. site-specific costs 
 Gross Margin Our gross margin is affected by changes in our net revenue and cost of revenue. Gross margin is affected by 1) the gross margin of each individual solar/storage power project we sell, which is determined by our ability to negotiate the sales price and our ability to effectively control the project acquisition and development costs, 2) the gross margin of each individual solar/storage power project we operate, which is determined by revenues from the sale of electricity generated from our operated solar/storage power projects and our ability to effectively control the operation costs, and 3) the gross margin of each individual EPC service we provide, which is determined by our ability to negotiate the sales price and our ability to effectively control the engineering, procurement and construction costs. Our gross margin increased to 43.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 40.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the increase in favorable margin within DSA and electricity generation segments. Our gross margin is at

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period-to-period. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. Our future financial statements will be affected to the extent that our actual results materially differ from these estimates. There were no significant changes in the Company s significant accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on August 1, 2024. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A discussion of recently issued accounting standards applicable to the Company is described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net Revenue . Our net revenue decreased from 13.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 12.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to (i) revenue from solar power project development decreasing by 0.8 million; (ii) revenue from EPC services decreasing by 1.8 million; offset by (iii) revenue from electricity generation increasing by 0.05 million and (iv) revenue from DSA and others increasing by 1.4 million. Our net revenue decreased from 60.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 57.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to (i) revenue from solar power project development decreasing by 9.1 million; (ii) revenue from electricity generation decreasing by 0.6 million; (iii) revenue from EPC services decreasing by 1.8 million and; offset by (iv) revenue from DSA and others increasing by 8.3 million, due to timing of project completion.

Our cost of revenue decreased from 40.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 38.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.3 million, compared to a gross profit of 19.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Interest Income and Expenses . Our interest income decreased from 0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decrease in interest income received from cash deposits. Our interest expenses increased from 0.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the increased average outstanding principal of finance lease and failed sales leaseback and long-term borrowings in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Foreign Exchange Gains (Losses). Foreign exchange loss was 4.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and foreign exchange gain was 4.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the strengthening of Euro during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Income Tax Expense . Income tax expense increased from 0.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The income tax expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 mainly resulted from the taxable income from UK and Italy. Income tax expense increased from 0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The income tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 mainly resulted from the taxable income from UK, Italy and Hungary. Net income (loss) . We had a net income of 5.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of 9.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the foreign exchange gain and decrease in operating expenses during the third quarter of 2024. We had a net income of 0.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of 2.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the foreign exchange gain, favorable income from operations, offset by income tax expense during the current period. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had negative operating cash flow of 14.6 million, and income from operations of 3.9 million and we repaid borrowings, finance lease and failed sales leaseback financing totaling of 7.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have positive working capital of 163.0 million. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, project assets, and continued support from financial institutions, fund investors and financing lease companies, in the form of renewed and additional short-term or long-term financings (including development loans, construction loans and project financings) and equity contribution, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs that will arise in the last quarter of 2024 and will be sufficient for the at the least the next 12 months from the issuance date of this quarterly report. We intend to continue to carefully execute our operating plans and manage credit and market risk. However, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, our liquidity could be negatively impacted. As part of our financing policy, we expect to continue to finance our liquidity needs mainly with cash flows from our operating activities. We continuously evaluate opportunities to pursue acquisitions or engage in strategic transactions. We expect to finance any significant future transaction with a combination of cash, long-term indebtedness and the issuance of shares of our company. As of September 30, 2024, significant components of our working capital were as follows: Our total current assets were 211.8 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 35.8 million. We had current project assets of 77.2 million in our late stage projects under development. Although we believe we will be able to sell such project assets at a profit, if we are unable to sell these project assets at reasonable prices in the near term, our liquidity may be negatively affected. 
 Cash generated from operations, external financing, and related party credit are our primary sources of operating liquidity, and we believe that cash flows from operations combined with our existing cash and cash equivalents, and facilities currently available, and those expected to be renewed will be sufficient to satisfy our obligations when they become due. Borrowings Short-term borrowings As of September 30, 2024, all the short-term borrowings have been fully repaid and there were no new short-term borrowings. Long-term borrowings and other liabilities In January 2021, our UK subsidiary obtained a long-term loan by a lender in the UK totaling 0.06 million. The long-term loan has a maturity date of July 2026 with an interest rate of 2.5 . The proceeds from this loan were used for general working capital purposes. The long-term borrowing was interest free for twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of this long-term borrowing was 0.03 million.

Currently, the Company does not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ). Our Disclosure Controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Our Disclosure Controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our Disclosure Controls, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls, which was done under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based on the evaluation of our Disclosure Controls, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our Disclosure Controls were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed below. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the preparation of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified three material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 relating to (i) the ineffective review and approval procedures over preparation of financial reporting at certain of our subsidiary locations; (ii) certain instances where some historical accounting supporting documents were not readily available and (iii) that the Company improperly offset refundable deposits on leases against lease liabilities in the consolidated financial statements presentation related to Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases ASC 842 ), in which refundable deposits on leases should be reflected as an asset on the consolidated balance sheet. We concluded that the failure to timely identify such accounting errors constituted material weaknesses as defined in the SEC regulations. As of June 30, 2024, we have addressed and remediated items (ii) and (iii) above; however, we have not remediated item (i) above as of September 30, 2024. In light of the continued material weakness related to the ineffective review and approval procedures over preparation of financial reporting at certain of our subsidiary locations, management determined that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 
 Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting To respond to this material weakness, we have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we plan to enhance our system of evaluating and implementing the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The process of designing and implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that satisfies our reporting obligations. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we have made significant efforts to implement controls whereby effective review and approval procedures over preparation of financial reporting at certain of our subsidiary locations were performed. In light of these continued significant efforts, we will wait after more time and more test that would extend in the year-end to determine whether this material weakness has been remediated. Other than the remediation efforts and changes in internal control over financial reporting described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to which this report relates, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
