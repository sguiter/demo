 On March 19, 2024, the Court issued a Supplemental Scheduling Order setting a June 4, 2024 hearing on Jazz s request for a permanent injunction or ongoing royalty. Briefing on Jazz s request closed on May 20, 2024, and the hearing was held June 4, 2024. On August 27, 2024, the Court issued an opinion and order enjoining Avadel from infringing claim 24 of U.S. Patent No. 11147782. That injunction excluded certain categories of conduct, including permitting Avadel to continue making, using and selling LUMRYZ for the treatment of narcolepsy and for use in ongoing clinical trials and studies. The August 27, 2024 opinion and order also granted Jazz s motion for an ongoing royalty, pending additional briefing on the appropriate royalty rate. That briefing closed on September 23, 2024. While a future ongoing royalty is pending briefing and a decision by the Court, the Company recorded an estimated liability for a royalty based on information available as of September 30, 2024. It is reasonably possible that a change in the estimate may occur pending the Court s decision on the appropriate royalty rate. On August 28, 2024, Avadel filed a notice of appeal concerning the August 27, 2024 injunction (the Patent Appeal ).

Overview 
 
 General Overview 
 
 Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: AVDL) Avadel, the Company, we, our, or us is a biopharmaceutical company. LUMRYZ is an extended-release formulation of sodium oxybate indicated to be taken once at bedtime for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness EDS in adults with narcolepsy and in the pediatric narcolepsy population seven years and older. 
 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, LUMRYZ is the only commercialized product in our portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our product portfolio. 
 
 LUMRYZ 
 
 LUMRYZ was approved by the FDA on May 1, 2023 for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults with narcolepsy. The FDA also granted seven years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity ODE to LUMRYZ for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults with narcolepsy due to a finding of clinical superiority of LUMRYZ relative to currently marketed oxybate treatments. In particular, the FDA found that LUMRYZ makes a major contribution to patient care over currently marketed, twice-nightly oxybate treatments by providing a once-nightly dosing regimen that avoids nocturnal arousal to take a second dose. The orphan exclusivity will continue until May 1, 2030. In June 2023, we announced the U.S. commercial launch of LUMRYZ for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults living with narcolepsy. LUMRYZ was approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in the pediatric narcolepsy population seven years and older on October 16, 2024, and was granted ODE through October 16, 2031. 
 
 In approving LUMRYZ, the FDA required a REMS for LUMRYZ to help ensure that the benefits of the drug in the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in adults with narcolepsy outweigh the risks of serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, misuse, abuse, and diversion of the drug. Under this REMS, healthcare providers who prescribe the drug must be specially certified; pharmacies that dispense the drug must be specially certified; and the drug must be dispensed only to patients who have enrolled in the LUMRYZ REMS and completed all REMS requirements, including documentation of safe use conditions. 
 
 Numerous LUMRYZ-related U.S. patents have been issued having expiration dates spanning from mid-2037 to early-2042, and there are additional patent applications currently in development and/or pending at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ), as well as foreign patent offices. We currently have numerous Orange Book listed patents. 
 
 With respect to clinical data generated for LUMRYZ, we conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial of LUMRYZ (the REST-ON trial ), which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 212 patients who received at least one dose of LUMRYZ or placebo, and was conducted in clinical sites in the U.S., Canada, Western Europe and Australia. Positive top line data from the REST-ON trial were announced on April 27, 2020. 
 
 - 23 - 

Additionally, our open-label extension/switch study of LUMRYZ RESTORE examined the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy of LUMRYZ in patients with narcolepsy who participated in the REST-ON trial, as well as dosing and preference data for patients who switched from twice-nightly sodium oxybate to once-at-bedtime LUMRYZ, regardless of whether they participated in the REST-ON trial. In May 2021, inclusion criteria were expanded to allow for oxybate na ve patients to enter the study. An interim safety analysis from the ongoing RESTORE study showed that LUMRYZ has generally been well-tolerated, with some patients receiving therapy for more than 18 months. In addition, interim data from RESTORE were presented demonstrating that a high proportion of patients switching from twice-nightly oxybate formulations had difficulty in taking the second dose, with a high proportion (92.5 stating a preference for the once-at-bedtime dosing regimen and that most participants switching from twice-nightly oxybate formulations had a stable dose equal to their starting dose. Subsequent interim data showed a preference (94.0 for the once-at-bedtime dosing regimen. The last patient visit occurred in October 2023. 
 
 A discrete choice experiment DCE showed that once-at-bedtime dosing, when compared to twice-nightly dosing, was the most important attribute driving both patient and clinician preference for overall oxybate product choice, as well as patient quality of life and reduction of patient anxiety/stress; dosing frequency (twice-nightly versus once-at-bedtime) was also viewed as a more important attribute as compared to other attributes assessed, including sodium content. Accompanying the DCE was a background survey for both patients and clinicians, which showed that dosing frequency was noted as a significant stressor by both patients and clinicians. 
 
 Additional peer-reviewed publications have included data on improvement on disturbed nocturnal sleep DNS ), the first DCE and a Plain Language Summary reviewing sodium oxybate and cardiovascular health, which did not identify a signal of cardiovascular disease in the over twenty years that sodium oxybate has been available. 
 
 A second DCE among clinicians was published in May 2023, showing the dosing regimen was the most important driver of choice, with once-nightly preferred. Post-hoc analyses of narcolepsy Type 1 NT1 and Type 2 NT2 were also published, demonstrating consistent improvements regardless of narcolepsy type. A third plain language summary has been published; most recently evaluated the improvements of LUMRYZ on DNS. 
 
 We believe LUMRYZ has the potential to demonstrate improved dosing compliance, safety, and patient satisfaction over other treatment options for cataplexy or EDS in patients with narcolepsy. 
 
 Avadel has initiated a Phase 3 pivotal trial in Idiopathic Hypersomnia IH ), REVITALYZ, which is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, multicenter Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LUMRYZ given as a once-at-bedtime dose, in IH. The study will enroll approximately 150 adults who are diagnosed with IH. On July 31, 2024, we announced that the first patient was dosed in this study. 
 
 The primary objective of REVITALYZ is to demonstrate reduction in daytime sleepiness as measured by the primary endpoint, change in total score of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale at Week 14. Secondary endpoints will evaluate the effect of LUMRYZ on additional efficacy parameters including patient and clinician impression of change, idiopathic hypersomnia severity, and a measure of the functional outcomes of sleep. 
 
 Ordinary Shares 
 
 Effective April 15, 2024, our ordinary shares were listed directly on the Nasdaq Stock Market. We caused a mandatory exchange of our ADSs for the underlying ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Accordingly, the BNY Mellon, as Depositary for the ADSs, issued a notice of termination of its ADR Program of ADSs to the registered holders of ADSs according to the requirements under the Deposit Agreement among the Company, BNY Mellon and holders of ADSs. The Deposit Agreement terminated on July 15, 2024. 
 
 Key Business Trends and Highlights 
 
 In operating our business and monitoring our performance, we consider a number of performance measures, as well as trends affecting our industry as a whole, which include the following: 
 
 Healthcare and Regulatory Reform: Various health care reform laws in the U.S. may impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products and technologies. The success of our commercialization efforts may depend on the extent to which the government health administration authorities, the health insurance funds in the E.U. Member States, private health insurers and other third-party payers in the U.S. will reimburse consumers for the cost of healthcare products and services. 
 
 - 24 - 

Competition and Technological Change: Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry continues to be intense and is expected to increase. We compete with academic laboratories, research institutions, universities, joint ventures, and other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including other companies developing niche branded or generic specialty pharmaceutical products or drug delivery platforms. Furthermore, major technological changes can happen quickly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Such rapid technological change, or the development by our competitors of technologically improved or differentiated products, could render our products, product candidates, or drug delivery platforms obsolete or noncompetitive. 
 
 Pricing Environment for Pharmaceuticals: The pricing environment continues to be in the political spotlight in the U.S. As a result, the need to obtain and maintain appropriate pricing for pharmaceutical products may become more challenging due to, among other things, the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the U.S. and worldwide. 
 
 Generics Playing a Larger Role in Healthcare: Generic pharmaceutical products will continue to play a large role in the U.S. healthcare system. LUMRYZ may face competition from manufacturers of generic twice-nightly sodium oxybate formulations. In January 2023, Hikma Pharmaceuticals plc, announced that it launched an authorized generic version of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc s Jazz Xyrem (sodium oxybate). In July 2023, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that it launched an authorized generic version of Jazz s Xyrem (sodium oxybate). 
 
 Access to and Cost of Capital: Similar to other businesses in our industry and at our stage of development, we will continue to rely on external sources of capital to fund our business. The process of raising capital and the associated cost of such capital for a company of our financial profile can be difficult and potentially expensive. If the need were to arise to raise additional capital, access to that capital may be difficult, expensive and/or dilutive and, as a result, could create liquidity challenges for us. 
 
 Continuing Net Loss from Operations: We have a recent history of generating losses from operations and expect to continue generating losses until revenues from the commercialization of LUMRYZ are sufficient to generate positive cash flow. LUMRYZ is the only commercialized product in our portfolio, and we will incur substantial expenses to continue our commercial launch of LUMRYZ. 
 
 Financial Highlights 
 
 Highlights of our consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 
 Net product revenue was 50,025 and 118,707 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to net product revenue of 7,014 and 8,510 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. LUMRYZ was approved by the FDA on May 1, 2023 for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults with narcolepsy and we began shipping product to our customers in June 2023. 
 
 Gross profit was 43,870 and 108,242 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to gross profit of 6,897 and 8,357 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of products sold increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher sales of LUMRYZ and an estimated ongoing royalty on net product revenue in the current period. Prior period cost of products sold included a greater portion of inventory purchased or produced that was expensed as research and development prior to FDA approval. 
 
 Total operating expense was 44,197 and 147,344 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to total operating expense of 42,007 and 121,306 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1,236 and 26,018 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by increased headcount and costs associated with the commercial launch of LUMRYZ and higher legal costs. Research and development expenses increased 954 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to new clinical work to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LUMRYZ given as a once-at-bedtime dose in IH, offset by lower pre-commercial related expenses. 
 
 Operating loss was 327 and 39,102 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to operating loss of 35,110 and 112,949 in the same periods last year, respectively. 
 
 - 25 - 

Diluted net loss per share was 0.03 and 0.46 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to diluted net loss per share of 0.41 and 1.71 in the same periods last year, respectively. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased to 65,807 at September 30, 2024 from 105,111 at December 31, 2023. The 39,304 decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by net cash used in operating activities of 54,780, offset by net proceeds of 9,250 from the sale of ADSs under the ADS Sales Agreement and 5,840 of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee share purchase plan issuances. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To prepare these financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. 
 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC suggests companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. The SEC considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the Management s Discussion Analysis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.

 The adequacy of our cash resources depends on the outcome of certain business conditions including the cost of our ongoing LUMRYZ commercialization activities, our cost structure, and other factors set forth in Risk Factors within Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. We will need to commit substantial resources to support the commercialization of LUMRYZ which could result in future losses or otherwise limit our opportunities or affect our ability to operate our business. Our assumptions concerning the outcome of certain business conditions may prove to be wrong or other factors may adversely affect our business, and as a result we could exhaust or significantly decrease our available cash and marketable securities balances which could, among other things, force us to raise additional funds and/or force us to reduce our expenses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we are unable to estimate the near or long term impacts of inflation, and rising interest rates, which may have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 
 We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash anticipated from sales of LUMRYZ, provides sufficient capital to meet our operating, royalty obligation and capital requirements for the next twelve months following the date of this Quarterly Report.

Other Matters 
 
 Litigation 
 
 We are subject to potential liabilities generally incidental to our business arising out of present and future lawsuits and claims related to product liability, personal injury, contract, commercial, intellectual property, tax, employment, compliance and other matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for potential liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no contingent liabilities with respect to any litigation, arbitration or administrative or other proceeding that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity. For information regarding legal proceedings we are involved in, see Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are subject to interest rate risk as a result of our portfolio of marketable securities. The primary objectives of our investment policy are as follows: safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and competitive yield. Although our investments are subject to market risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or certain types of investment. Our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of instruments, including U.S. federal government and federal agency securities, European Government bonds, corporate bonds or commercial paper issued by U.S. or European corporations, money market instruments, certain qualifying money market mutual funds, certain repurchase agreements, tax-exempt obligations of states, agencies, and municipalities in the U.S. and Europe, and equities. A hypothetical 50 basis point change in interest rates would not result in a material decrease or increase in the fair value of our securities due to the general short-term nature of our investment portfolio. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as the functional currency financial statements of a non-U.S. subsidiary is translated to U.S. dollars. The assets and liabilities of this non-U.S. subsidiary having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, and at the average exchange rate for the reporting period for revenue and expense accounts. The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity. The reported results of this non-U.S. subsidiary will be influenced by their translation into U.S. dollars by currency movements against the U.S. dollar. Our primary currency translation exposure is related to one subsidiary that has functional currencies denominated in euro. A 10 strengthening/weakening in the rates used to translate the results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that have functional currencies denominated in euro as of September 30, 2024 would have had an immaterial impact on net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies other than the functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the appropriate functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and the resulting gains and losses are reported in investment and other income, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of loss. As of September 30, 2024, our primary exposure is to transaction risk related to euro net monetary assets and liabilities held by subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency. Realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains resulting from transactional exposure were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Inflation Risk 
 
 Inflation generally affects us by increasing our costs of labor and supplies and the costs of our third parties we rely on for the development, manufacture and supply of our products. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some effect in the near future (especially if inflation rates rise) due to an impact on the costs to conduct clinical trials, the costs 
 - 30 - 

to commercially launch LUMRYZ, labor costs we incur to attract and retain qualified personnel, and other operational costs. Inflationary costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
