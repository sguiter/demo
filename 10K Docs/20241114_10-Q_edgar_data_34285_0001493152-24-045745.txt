Upon
purchasing MMG and thereafter, the Vivos Group began borrowing monies from MMG starting with in 2016, and by the end of 2019 the
balance had reached , which included a guarantee from Dr. Doki. Vivos Holdings, LLC, Vivos Real Estate Holdings, LLC, and
Dr. Doki are collectively referred to as Vivos Debtors. 

Additionally,
Reliability became aware of debt obligations that included MMG as a borrower or guarantor that the Vivos Group failed to disclose to
Reliability. This and the attempted collection of the guarantee and debt from the Vivos Group set off a chain of legal events culminating
in an arbitration hearing and award in 2022. We refer below to the disputes between Reliability and the Vivos Group as the Vivos
Matter. 

A
series of legal actions and hearings took place starting in March of 2020 through September of 2021, culminating in an agreement to settle
through arbitration. On August 31, 2022, the arbitrator issued an award (the Award with the Company and MMG prevailing
on their claims. The awards included citing fraud damages. Supplemental awards were subsequently issued on May 17, 2023, October 10,
2023, and finally, on October 27, 2023. Summarily, MMG was awarded the totals of all notes the Vivos Group had with MMG for its borrowings,
the contracted interest, attorneys fees and expenses of , and a contract damage of to be satisfied by the transfer
of their shares of the Company common stock to the Company equal in value to . 

The
May 17, 2023, award also appointed a rehabilitative receiver (the Receiver whose primary function is to collect the contract
and fraud damages, including costs, expenses, and fees provided in the awards. With respect to the receivership, the Vivos Group owners
or holders of all the shares of common stock of the Company were declared not to be entitled to vote any of those shares at any annual
or special meetings of the shareholders of the Company during the period of the receivership. 

On
October 10, 2023, the Arbitrator issued a Supplemental Award appointing the Receiver to assist the Company in collecting the awarded
amounts. In the award, the Arbitrator established the powers of the Receiver.

On
December 29, 2023, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland signed orders entering all three arbitration awards as judgments
in Reliability s case against the Vivos Group. These orders became final on January 29, 2024, when the appeal period expired for
the defendants. The judgments are good for 12 years and can be enrolled in other states. Reliability has collectible judgments which
the Receiver is now eligible to pursue. 

Per
Maryland law, the enrolling of judgements enables MMG to apply interest to the Vivos Debtor balance beginning December 29, 2023.
MMG began applying the additional interest in the second quarter 2024. 

Upon
final resolution as to the underlying ownership and rights of certain shareholders, the Company intends to hold an annual meeting of
shareholders within a reasonable time thereafter. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Vivos Debtor balance was . The Award value in totality currently aggregates , independent of legal
fees after the award and interest. 

Basis
of presentation 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including
its owned subsidiary, MMG. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The

a fair statement of financial position and the results of operations for the periods presented, have been reflected herein. The results
of operations for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.

Combined, this totals of revenue. In 2023, these same three companies accounted for , , and , respectively, which combined

, , and , respectively, management believes it has the ability to continue as a going concern and meet its financial
obligation as they become due in 2024 and beyond. The factors impacting this view include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Cash
 flow forecast showing sufficient cash and working capital 52 weeks from November 6, 2024; 

The
 expected reductions in continuing legal fees in 2024 given the Company has collectible judgments that the Receiver is now pursuing; 

An
 expectation that the notes receivable from related parties will be remunerated in cash and/or stock, and that stock will provide capital
 market access over the long term; 

Expected
 progress in sales, new agreements that will begin fulfillment in early 2025, our current pipeline, and current larger clients who
 indicated increases in media activity for 2024, which in the first nine months of 2024, were realized; and 

The
 Company has additional availability to use its factoring line to extend borrowing of up to of unfactored invoices which, as of
 November 14, 2024, was . 

As
a result of the foregoing, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash to meet its financial obligations for the next 12 months
and beyond as they become due.

In
September 2022, MMG learned that a Vivos IT, LLC lawsuit against Second Wind Consulting SWC ), in May 2019 included MMG
as a plaintiff. SWC effectually countersued plaintiffs Suresh Doki, Naveen Doki, and Silvija Valleru on September 30, 2019, seeking to
collect the balance of not paid by the Vivos Group. This was not disclosed to MMG management or to Reliability before the Merger
which closed on October 29, 2019. 

MMG
counsel filed a motion to add four parties to a counterclaim (HCRN, M M, 360 IT, and US IT). The court approved our motion, and all four
parties were added. MMG has since released HCRN from the counterclaim. On July 24, 2024, the court denied SWC s motion for summary
judgement related to their counterclaim. 

However,
Healthcare Resource Network (HCRN) believed this motion violated a previous settlement agreement between Maslow and HCRN, dating back
to 2021, which offered broad indemnification language. HCRN provided support to Maslow that it had carved itself out of the SWC agreement
as it did not receive any support from SWC. On August 30, 2024, Maslow reimbursed HCRN for legal fees incurred to defend itself after
they were added to the lawsuit. 

As
for the SWC matter, at the present time, the counterclaim parties have reached a mutual understanding with an expectation of dismissal of the matter with
minimal contribution from the company which are in the process of executing.

In
June 2023, VREH was able to sell the property at 22 Baltimore Road, in Rockville, Maryland, leaving the Company with no liability with
respect to the building that MMG was signed as a guarantor without managements knowledge in 2017. The Company was entitled to cash in
the amount of as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings and sale of the building, which we received on August 31, 2024. The credit

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
This section includes several forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. All statements that address
expectations or projections about the future, including, but not limited to, statements about our plans, strategies, adequacy of
resources and future financial results (such as revenue, gross profit, operating profit, cash flow), are forward-looking statements.
Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by words like anticipates, believes, 
 expects, may, will, can, could, should, 
 intends, project, predict, plans, estimates, 
 goal, target, possible, potential, would, seek, 
and similar references to future periods. These statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve a number of risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and
assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control
or are subject to change, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to: our ability to access the capital markets by pursuing additional debt and equity
financing to fund our business plan and expenses; negative outcome of pending and future claims and litigation and our ability to
comply with our contractual covenants, including in respect of our debt; potential loss of clients and possible rejection of our
business model and/or sales methods; weakness in general economic conditions and levels of capital spending by customers in the
industries we serve; weakness or volatility in the financial and capital markets, which may result in the postponement or
cancellation of our customers projects or the inability of our customers to pay our fees; delays or reductions in U.S.
government spending; credit risks associated with our customers; competitive market pressures; the availability and cost of
qualified labor; our level of success in attracting, training and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff
employees; changes in tax laws and other government regulations, including the impact of health care reform laws and regulations;
the possibility of incurring liability for our business activities, including, but not limited to, the activities of our temporary
employees; our performance on customer contracts; and government policies, legislation or judicial decisions adverse to our
businesses. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
hereof. We assume no obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,
except as required by law. We recommend readers to carefully review the entirety of this Quarterly Report, the Risk
Factors in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the other
reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), particularly our
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, our expectations regarding the future performance
of our business and the other non-historical statements in the discussion and analysis are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, with the SEC. Our actual results may differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should read the following discussion together with our financial statements
and related notes thereto and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND COMMENTS RELATED TO OPERATIONS 

This
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses based on historical experience and various other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

There
have been no material changes or developments in the Company s evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions
or methodologies that it believes to be Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates as disclosed in its Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023. 

Management s
Discussion included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, includes discussion of various factors and items related to
the Company s results of operations and liquidity. There have been no other significant changes in most of the factors discussed
in the Form 10-K and many of the items discussed in the Form 10-K are relevant to 2024 operations; thus, the reader of this report should
read Management s Discussion included in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Revenues 

Revenues
for the three months ending September 30, 2024, were 6,230, which represented an increase of 889 over the 5,341 generated in the third
quarter of 2023. This was the first time we have enjoyed three quarters of consecutive revenue beats on comparative periods to a year
ago since 2019. Our top four clients all had increases in revenue when compared to the third quarter of a year ago of 1,394. 

Our
EOR segment continues to drive this year-over-year growth with third quarter revenue of its own of, which was 826 or.18.5 over 2023 s
third quarter EOR revenue of 4,467. Our top four revenue producing clients overall contributed 4,255 or 80.4 of EOR quarterly revenue
compared to 2,926 a year ago in the period ending September 30, 2023. The EOR segment revenue quarterly increase from these four clients
was a combined 1,329. 

Staffing
revenue at 822 increased over its performance a year ago by 112 or 15.8 , when the period ended September 30, 2023, resulted in 710.
One new client was the catalyst, adding 156 for the quarter. Otherwise, if one declining account is omitted, 13 clients were up 20
over the same period a year ago. 

Our
Video Production and Direct Hire segments were down comparatively to the third quarter of 2023 as revenue in the third quarter
2024 was 87 and 28, respectively, to 100 and 64 in revenue, respectively, in 2023. Thus, Video Production was down 13.7 and Direct
Hire 57 . 

Revenues
at 17,566 grew 1,574 for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024, versus the same period in 2023 with a total of 15,992. The
increase was driven by our top four revenue producers amassing 12,172 in the nine months ending September 30, 2024, which represents 69.3 
of our total revenue and a 3,542 increase over their revenue contributions in the same nine-month period ending September 30, 2023.
The aforementioned four clients have each surpassed the million-dollar mark year to date. 

EOR
drove the nine-month growth with 15,108 in revenue which was 1,868, or 14.1 more than this business garnered in the same period 2023 when it produced 13,240 in revenue. Otherwise, in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024, Staffing at 2,202 was off 2023 s
third quarter pace by 136, or 5.8 , which was about 5.7 better than the gap in the second quarter 2024. Video Production
at 177 was 122 or 40.9 away from 2023 s nine-month revenue of 299. Finally, Direct Hire revenue at 79 was 36 off the pace
of where it was to the same nine-month period in 2023 at 115. 

Cost
of Revenue / Gross Profit 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, gross profit at 834 saw a 62 or 8.0 improvement comparatively to the three-month
period ended September 30, 2023, when gross profit landed on 772. Gross margins, however, at 13.4 were not as strong as they were a
year ago at 14.5 . Several factors contributed to the margin drop, including the higher margin Direct Hire revenue being down by 36,
our EOR business increasing by 1.3 to 85.0 of revenue at 12.1 margins vs. 12.5 which was caused by a shift in our labor from W2 to
lower margin 1099. 

The
shift of revenue concentration by 1.3 to EOR at 12.1 margins alone resulted in a loss of gross profit by approximately 44 or seventy
basis points (.7). 

In
terms of gross profit, EOR and Staffing saw increases of 83 and 13 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, while Video Production
and Direct Hire were off the mark by 1 and 33, respectively. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, gross profit at 2,346 improved by 123 or 5.5 over the 2,223 earned comparatively
to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Gross
margins for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, were 13.4 , versus 13.9 where margins stood a year ago at the end of September
2023. The paradigm causing the deficiency is the same as the third quarter, as the nine-month revenue mix weighed heavier to EOR as the
business unit grew in gross profit by 201 while the other three declined by a combined gross margin of 125. This phenomenon alone caused
margins to compress by 42 basis points which explains 79 of the 53-basis point spread (13.4 to 13.95 ). 

EOR
margins declined 20 basis points (12.3 to 12.1 in the nine months ending September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in
2023, as a heavier use of 1099 labor of almost 1,500 at a 2.5 lower margin more than offset a W2 margin increase by 30 basis
points. When extending EOR contracts we continue to incorporate reasonable pricing markup increases which slowly should improve
margins. Additionally, our customer mix continues to be more weighted to clients that have favorable pricing terms than those that
previously dominated sales. This is why our EOR business is now seeing 12.1 margins as opposed to the 9.8 it did, four years
ago. 

17 

General
and Administrative G A 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ending September 30, 2024 were 958 compared to 998 in the same period in 2023,
representing a 40 or 4.0 favorable result. The decrease in spending when compared to 2023 s second quarter was rooted in 71
in lower legal costs than a year ago, 23 of which were reimbursed outside counsel fees for an employee matter that a client agreed to
take responsibility. 

Base
salaries, payroll tax and benefits were higher by 44, and benefits by 30 in the third quarter 2024 compared to the same period 2023.
Bonus and Commissions, though, saw reductions of 65. 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, were 2,891 compared to 2,843 a year ago, resulting in 48
or 1.7 more in costs 2024 when compared to the same year to date period ending September 30, 2023. Loaded Payroll was 221 higher with a 168 increase in salaries as we have continued to bolster our sales and client services departments. A continued increase in our
health insurance benefits and higher usage of our subsidy resulted in a 47 increase in the nine months ending September 2024 compared
to 2023. Non-salary SG A costs 173 or 18.5 favorable as approximately 97 of 103 in Legal cost savings were reclassed or booked
in 2024 to Other (See last paragraph of this section below for further details). 

Otherwise,
cost savings were realized in Contract Services by 77, Staff Events which were scaled back by 39, Payroll fees by 14, and Travel
and Meals and Entertainment by 9. Unfavorable changes in SG A expenses by category were Recruiting Software costs 34 (these
are allocated to COR if associated with Staffing or Direct Hire fulfillment), Business Insurance at 15, Communications at 8, and
Business License and Taxes at 10 which now consist of state minimum tax and franchise fees to states that are not deemed to be
state income taxes. Prior to 2024, we were booking these taxes and fees to state income taxes. 

On
December 29, 2023, we learned the Maryland Circuit court certified the arbitration award as a judgement. The costs related to the award
are now centered on collection and recovery. Since we began separating non-core operational expenses in 2023 and recording them to Other
Expense, MMG decided to begin recording all related Receiver expenses from SG A (operational) legal to Other Expense in the second
quarter. This practice continues, which lowers costs associated with non-operational legal obligations. 

Interest
Expense 

In
the three-month period ending September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 27 in interest charges for financing, factoring, and paying an
advance rate (BIP) against its invoices compared with 12 in the same period a year ago. 

In
the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 62 in interest charges for financing, factoring, and paying an
advance rate (BIP) against its invoices compared with 77 in the same period a year ago. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

These
non-operational costs, in the third quarter totaled 68 including 32 in Receiver and arbitration award related legal costs. This represented
 55 more than the 13 we incurred in the third quarter of 2023. In the three-month period ending September 30, 2024, we incurred 30
more in legal costs related to the SWC matter (see Note 6), and another 25 for a settlement with HCRN. We began booking these non-operational
fees to Other Income (Expense) last year in the second quarter. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other Expense was 297, which was 164 greater than a year ago when Other Expenses tallied
 133. Because approximately 97 of the 297 were Receiver related costs, the normalized Other Expense increase year to date in 2024 versus
2023 would have been 68. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our
working capital requirements are driven predominantly by EOR field talent payments, G A salaries, public company costs, interest
associated with financing, legal fees associated with the Vivos and related SWC matter and client accounts receivable receipts. Since
receipts from client payments are on average 60 days behind payments to field talent, working capital requirements can be periodically
challenged. To accelerate cash and ensure sufficient liquidity, we have both a Buyer Initiated Payment BIP agreement
with American Express Amex and a Factoring Facility with Gulf Coast Bank Gulf ). 

Our
BIP agreement with Amex enables MMG to be advanced 100 of purchase order approved invoices minus a flat interest rate percentage that
is based on that day s submitted invoice volume. The greater the volume the lower the interest rate charged. The implementation
of this program in the second quarter of 2023 profoundly impacted our ability to accelerate cash conversion and lower DSO as well as
our borrowing costs. Given our use of BIP is with 90-day terms clients, our approximate APR is 6.1 compared to Factoring average approximate
APR rate of 10.6 based on the current prime rate of 8 . 

18 

Gulf,
on the other hand, advances 93 of our eligible receivables at an advance rate of 15 basis points, an interest rate of prime plus
2 ., and our prime floor rate at 4 . Our Days Outstanding (DSO) remained strong for the trailing twelve months ending September 30, 2024,
at 49 compared to a 53 DSO for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023. 

These
programs, plus the portion of our business in which the client has elected or is required to pay in advance of payroll, approximately
 198 every two weeks, counteract the approximate 32 of our revenue from clients that are on 90-day terms, some of which were demanded
by larger clients, and have delays in providing receipt of purchase orders. 

When
looking at A/R aging in relation to payments to due date, as of September 30, 2024, 98.7 was 

Our
primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations via accounts receivable and borrowings under our Factoring Facility
with Gulf enabling access to the 7 unfactored portion. Because certain large clients have changed their payment practices
announcing 60- and 90-day terms amounting to a unilateral extension to contractual terms by 30-60 days, we would otherwise be
adversely impacted but not since we adopted Amex s BIP program which coupled with an increase in our client biweekly
prepayments (drawdowns) to 198 from 159, over the past 12 months, have been catalysts to our cash conversion success measured by
our DSO improving from 66 at the start of 2023 to 49 at the end of June and carried over to September 2024. 

Our
primary uses of cash are for payments to field talent, corporate and staff employees, related payroll liabilities, operating expenses,
public company costs, including but not limited to, general and professional liability and directors and officer s liability insurance
premiums; legal fees; filing fees; auditor and accounting fees; stock transfer services; and board compensation, followed by cash factoring
and other borrowing interest; cash taxes; and debt payments. 

Since
we are an EOR with the majority of contracted talent paid as W-2 employees who are paid known amounts, but on inconsistent schedules,
our cash inflows do not typically align with these required payments, resulting in temporary cash challenges, which is why we employ
factoring. 

Vivos
Debtors as of September 30, 2024, had notes receivable totaling 5,827, including default on a 3,000 promissory note and on a 750 tax
obligation in December 2019. 

It
was also anticipated that following the Merger, the Company would both access the capital markets by selling additional shares of Company
Common Stock and use shares of Company Common Stock as currency to acquire other business revenues. However, all 300 million authorized
shares of Company Common Stock were issued in connection with the Merger. No shares are expected to become available to the Company until
the legal dispute with the Vivos Debtors and Vivos Group is resolved. At that point, the Company can decide whether to amend the Company s
Certificate of Formation to increase the number of authorized shares of Company Common Stock or approve a reverse split of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock to provide additional shares for these purposes. No assurance can be given as to when this might take
place. 

On
April 22, 2024, MMG received a refund of 288 from the IRS. The proceeds were accrued in the first quarter since the credits were for
past tax events. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our working capital was 7,536 compared to 7,592 on June 30, 2024, 7,783 at the end of March 2024, to 7,913
at end of December 2023 and compared 8,040 at the end of September 2023. Our adjusted working capital, as of September 30, 2024, excluding
the notes receivable related to the Vivos Debtors, totals 1,709, compared to 1,826 compared at the end of June 2024, compared to 2,212
at the end of the first quarter, to 2,412 at the end of 2023, and finally compared to 2,623 at the end of September 2023. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Risk Controls and Procedures 

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the President
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report
were effective such that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide
absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial
reporting, known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, that occurred during the period covered by this report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

A
series of legal actions and hearings took place starting in March of 2020 with the Vivos Group over Merger agreement violations and Vivos
Group debt obligations. Arbitration was agreed to in the fall of 2021 by both the Vivos Group and MMG with the proceedings commencing
in February 2022. 

On
August 31, 2022, the arbitrator issued the Award with the Company and MMG prevailing on their claims. The awards included citing of fraud
damages. Supplemental awards were subsequently issued on May 17, 2023, October 10, 2023, and finally on October 27, 2023. Summarily,
MMG was awarded the totals of all notes the Vivos Group had with MMG for its borrowings, the contracted interest, attorneys fees
and expenses of 1,209, and a contract damage of 1,000, to be satisfied by the transfer of their shares of the Company Common Stock
to the Company equal in value to 1,000. The aggregate amount of the Awards totaled 7,779 as of September 30, 2024. 

The
May 17, 2023 award also appointed a Receiver whose primary function is to collect the contract and fraud damages, including costs,
expenses, and fees provided in the awards. 

On
December 29, 2023, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland signed orders entering all three arbitration awards as judgments
in Reliability s case against the Vivos Group. These orders became final on January 29, 2024, when the appeal period expired for
the defendants. The judgments are good for 12 years and can be enrolled in other states. Reliability has collectible judgments which
the Receiver is now eligible to pursue. 

The
following represents legal proceedings where Vivos Group borrowings impact MMG: 

In
September 2022, MMG learned that a Vivos IT, LLC lawsuit against SWC in May 2019 included MMG as a plaintiff. The lawsuit related to
a debt restructuring services agreement secured by Suresh Doki, Naveen Doki, and Silvija Valleru to assist the following then-owned Vivos
entities: Maslow Media Group, Inc., Health Care Resources Network, Inc., Mettler Michael, Inc., 360 IT Professionals, Inc., and
US IT Solutions, Inc. SWC countersued all plaintiffs on September 30, 2019 seeking to collect the balance of 403 not paid by the Vivos
Group. This was not disclosed to MMG management or to Reliability before the Merger which closed on October 29, 2019. 

MMG
counsel filed a motion to add 4 parties to a counterclaim (HCRN, M M, 360 IT and US IT). The court approved our motion, and all 4
parties were added. MMG has since released HCRN from the counterclaim. SWC filed a motion for summary judgement and on March 18, 2024,
MMG responded, opposing the motion. On July 24, 2024, the court denied SWC s motion for summary judgement related to their counterclaim. 

Item
1a. Risk Factors 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, shareholders should carefully consider the factors discussed in
Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business,
financial condition, or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

We
are currently engaged in litigation and collecting an arbitration award with the Vivos Group, the outcome
of which could materially harm our business and financial results. 

As
more fully described in Note 6 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, while we received a favorable arbitration outcome with the Vivos Group, but the ultimate collection of cash and shares is unknown. 

The
collection process is complex, and has caused and could continue to cause us to incur significant costs,
as well as distract our management over an extended period.

CERTIFICATIONS
UNDER SECTION 302 

I,
Nick Tsahalis, certify that: 

1.
I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-Q of Reliability Incorporated; 

2.
