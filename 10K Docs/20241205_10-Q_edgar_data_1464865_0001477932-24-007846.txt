Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. SPECIAL NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our security holders and to the public. This report, therefore, contains statements about future events and expectations which are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and prospects under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You can expect to identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may, might, could, would, will, anticipate, believe, plan, estimate, project, expect, intend, seek and other similar expressions. Any statement contained in this report that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be a forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the plans, objectives, expectations and prospects reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that our plans, objectives, expectations and prospects will be achieved. Important factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements are contained in the Risk Factors section of and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The following discussion of our results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Overview On February 6, 2019, the Company acquired trademarks and intellectual property, which included all rights and trade secrets to the hemp-derived CBD-infused line of consumer beverages sold under the Good Hemp brand. On April 30, 2019, the Company acquired the CANNA HEMP and CANNA trademarks including all rights and trade secrets and related inventory. On August 24, 2020, with an effective date of July 1, 2020, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Paul Hervey Hervey ), an individual, for the purpose of cultivating hemp on approximately 9 acres of farmland and in approximately 3,700 square feet of greenhouse space in North Carolina (referred to as Olin Farms ). In October 2021, Olin Farms ceased operations, and the limited liability company joint venture entity was dissolved. On February 9, 2021, the Company formed Good Hemp Wellness, LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of North Carolina, to sell CBD products to customers through chiropractic offices. In October 2021, this company was dissolved in North Carolina, and it is being treated as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. In February 2023, the Company sold all of its Good Hemp-related to JanBella Group, LLC, a company controlled by the Company s current controlling shareholder, William Alessi (then, a third-party). In consideration of such assets, Mr. Alessi forgave 5,000 of indebtedness of the Company. On April 1, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase Diamond Creek Group, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company which sells the Diamond Creek brand of high alkaline water products, for a total purchase price of 643,000. On April 2, 2021, the Company closed the acquisition and paid the initial 500,000 portion of the purchase price, and on April 23, 2021, paid the 143,000 purchase price balance. Effective May 11, 2022, the Company acquired, by merger, Petro X Solutions, Inc., a Wyoming corporation PXS ). In the transaction, the Company issued a total of 120,000,000 shares of its common stock. PXS markets competitively-priced, environmentally-friendly products that are designed to work as well as or better than their toxic competitors. Its primary product, EnviroXstreamTM, is a plant-based, non-toxic, safe, yet powerful, cleaner/degreaser technology that expedites the natural bio-degradation process of hydrocarbons and other compounds. EnviroXstreamTM is currently a California South Coast AQMD-Certified Clean Air Solvent, and in the past has been, an EPA-designated Safer Choice product. EnviroXstreamTM distinguishes itself by its efficacy, which is buttressed by its green credentials. 21 Table of Contents Effective June 1, 2023, the PXS acquisition was rescinded, such that all securities issued by the Company in connection with the PXS acquisition were cancelled and the ownership of PXS returned to its prior owners. PXS is being treated as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Current Plan of Business Since the June 1, 2023, rescission of the PXS acquisition, the Company has re-focused its operating plans on expanding its Diamond Creek Water business. However, without additional capital, it is unlikely that such business will expand rapidly, if at all. Results of Operations For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 Revenues We had 241,136 and 164,515 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue was lower in 2024 as a result of management focusing on revamping the operations and getting sales force and processes dialed in for future growth along with an aggressive marketing campaign in 2024. Cost of Sales We had 189,824 and 121,616 of cost of sales and a gross profit of 51,312 and 42,899 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 426,497 and 77,195 respectively. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to increased advertising and marketing expense and consulting expense. Other Income (Expenses) Other income (expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 4,647,187 and 216,675), respectively. The difference was caused by the change in the derivative liabilities of 4,683,044 and 169,306) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net Loss Net income (loss) from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 4,272,002 and 250,971), respectively. Net loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 0 and 0, respectively. Net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 4,272,002 and 250,971), respectively. For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues We had 452,837 and 543,116 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue was lower in 2024 as a result of management focusing on revamping the operations and getting sales force and processes dialed in for future growth. The Company began an advertising and marketing campaign during the third quarter of 2024. Cost of Sales We had 362,881 and 414,646 of cost of sales and a gross profit of 89,956 and 128,470 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 22 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 549,384 and 210,967, respectively. The increase in expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to increased advertising and marketing expense and consulting expense. Other Income (Expenses) Other income (expenses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 2,578,659 and 1,693,169), respectively. The difference was caused by the change in the derivative liabilities of 2,762, 559 and 1,623,455) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net Loss Net income (loss) from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 2,119,231 and 1,775,418), respectively. Net loss from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 0 and 197,251, respectively. Net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 2,119,231 and 1,972,669), respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources We had cash used in operations of 244,813 the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9,497 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We had cash used in investing activities of 0 and 541 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had cash provided by financing activities of 256,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by financing activities of 29,950 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 12,106. We do not have sufficient resources to effectuate our business. We expect to incur a minimum of 100,000 in expenses during the next twelve months of operations. We estimate that these expenses will be comprised primarily of general expenses including overhead, inventory purchases, legal and accounting fees. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has primarily been funded by the advances from related parties and convertible notes. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received related party advances of 9,000, funds from notes payable totaling 132,500, net of discounts, and funds from convertible notes payable totaling 130,000, net of discounts, respectively. The Company does not know of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonable likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. The Company does not know of any significant changes in expected sources and uses of cash. The Company does not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide it with any equity capital. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had a working capital deficit of 1,227,987 at September 30, 2024, a net income of 2,119,231 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 244,813 of cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of the interim financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources . 23 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. A smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this item. Item 4. Control and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean a company s controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its chief executive and chief financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the chief executive and interim chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of such date. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have determined that the Company continues to have the following deficiencies which represent a material weakness: The Company does not have a majority of independent directors; Lack of in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting issues surrounding certain complex or non-routine transactions. With material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions; Insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting; and Insufficient written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. To remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures: as funding permits, the Company will add sufficient accounting personnel to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements; the Company will hire staff technically proficient at applying U.S. GAAP to financial transactions and reporting; and upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and procedures. 24 Table of Contents The additional hiring is contingent upon the Company s efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt and the results of its operations. Management hopes to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able to do so. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls The Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 25 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. Other than disclosed herein, there were no pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of our operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors Not required. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None that have not otherwise been disclosed. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities None. Item 4.
