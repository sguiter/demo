 Valuation of Intangible Assets 
 For all acquisitions, the fair values of the trade name and manufacturing know-how intangible assets were determined by using an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty approach, which is a commonly accepted valuation approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset. Therefore, a portion of earnings, equal to the after-tax royalty that would have been paid for the use of the asset, can be attributed to our ownership. 
 The fair values of the customer relationships and backlog intangible assets were determined by using an income approach which is a commonly accepted valuation approach. Under this approach, the net earnings attributable to the asset or liability being measured are isolated using the discounted projected net cash flows. These projected cash flows are isolated from the projected cash flows of the combined asset group over the remaining economic life of the intangible asset or liability being measured. Both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective. Our estimates of market participant net cash flows considered historical and projected pricing, operational performance including market participant synergies, aftermarket retention, product life cycles, material and labor pricing, and other relevant customer, contractual and market factors. Where appropriate, the net cash flows were adjusted to reflect the potential attrition of existing customers in the future, as existing customers are expected to decline over time. The attrition-adjusted

 years is primarily driven by large customer relationships tied to long-duration aircraft platforms. 
 Intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis (which approximates the economic pattern of benefits). 
 Supplemental Pro Forma Data 
 The results of operations of CryoWorks, Vian and BAUM have been included in our financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the respective acquisition dates. Consolidated pro forma revenue and net income attributable to common shareholders related to these acquisitions have not been presented since their impact is not material to our financial results for the period.

 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of firm orders which have not yet been fulfilled, which we also refer to as total backlog. As of September 30, 2024, total backlog was million. We expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2024, an additional in 2025 and the balance thereafter. 
 Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities 
 Contract assets represent unbilled amounts that typically arise from contracts for customized products or contracts for products sold directly to the U.S. government or indirectly to the U.S. government through subcontracts, where revenue recognized using the cost-to-cost method exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Contract assets are assessed for impairment and recorded at their net realizable value. Contract liabilities represent advance payments from customers. Revenue related to contract liabilities is recognized when control is transferred to the customer. We report contract assets, which are included within Other current assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and contract liabilities, which are included within Accrued liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, on a contract-by-contract net basis at the end of each reporting period. 
 Contract liabilities

 Note 9 - 

Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, is lower than the prior year s comparable period primarily due to lower non-U.S. taxes and lower statutorily non-deductible costs, partially offset by the statutory U.S. deduction related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries income. 
 Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is higher than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates higher than the United States, expenses that are statutorily non-deductible for income tax purposes and the impact of U.S. state taxes, partially offset by excess share-based compensation benefits, tax credit utilization, and the statutory U.S. deduction related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries income. 
 Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
 During both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, increased by million, and million, respectively, primarily due to increases in tax positions taken in the current and prior period, and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 these items were partially offset by reductions from the expiration of statutes of limitations. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would cause our effective tax rate to increase by million and million, respectively. The difference between these amounts relates to (1) offsetting tax effects from other tax jurisdictions, and (2) interest expense, net of deferred taxes. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized million and million, respectively, of interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of accrued interest and penalty expense related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was million and million, respectively. 
 million due to expiration of statutes of limitations and settlements with tax authorities. However, if the ultimate resolution of income tax examinations results in amounts that differ from this estimate, we will record additional income tax expense or benefit in the period in which such matters are effectively settled.

 Intangibles with indefinite useful lives, consisting of trade names, are tested annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for impairment. If the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Fair value is calculated using the relief from royalty method. We amortize the cost of definite-lived intangibles over their estimated useful lives. We also review all of our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

 million, retaining only a small parcel on which our remediation and treatment systems are located. We will continue to be responsible for all remediation costs associated with the Goodyear Site. 
 On August 12, 2022, Crane Holdings, Co., Crane Company, a then wholly-owned subsidiary of Crane Holdings, Co., and Redco Corporation (f/k/a Crane Co., Redco )) a then wholly-owned subsidiary of Crane Company that held liabilities including asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Redco Purchase Agreement with Spruce Lake Liability Management Holdco LLC Redco Buyer ), an unrelated third party long-term liability management company specializing in the acquisition and management of legacy corporate liabilities, whereby Crane Company transferred to Redco Buyer all of the issued and outstanding shares of Redco (the Redco Sale ). Pursuant to the terms of the Redco Purchase Agreement, Crane Company and Redco Buyer will each indemnify the other for breaches of representations and warranties, breaches of covenants and obligations and certain liabilities, subject to the terms of the Redco Purchase Agreement. Such covenants and obligations include obligations of Crane Company to indemnify Redco and its affiliates for all other historical liabilities of Redco, which include certain potential environmental liabilities. Crane Holdings, Co. guaranteed the full payment and performance of Crane Company s indemnification obligations under the Redco Purchase Agreement. On April 3, 2023, Crane Holdings, Co. completed the Separation, pursuant to which, among other things, all outstanding shares of Crane Company were distributed to Crane Holdings, Co. s stockholders. Upon completion of the Separation, pursuant to the terms of the Redco Purchase Agreement, Crane Holdings, Co. was released from its guarantee of Crane Company s indemnification obligations under the Redco Purchase Agreement. Prior to the effective date of the Redco Sale, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed that Crane Holdings, Co. and, following completion of the Separation, Crane Company will be primarily liable for the Goodyear Site. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection agreed to transfer the liability of the Roseland Site to Crane Holdings, Co., and to further transfer this environmental liability to Crane Company upon effectiveness of the Separation. The potential liability for the Crab Orchard Site referenced below remains a direct obligation of Redco. As noted above, however, Crane Company has agreed to indemnify Redco and Redco Buyer against the Goodyear, Roseland, and Crab Orchard environmental liabilities. Thus, references below in this Note 12 to we , and us refer to Crane Company in its capacity as the primarily responsible party for the Goodyear and Roseland Sites, and as indemnitor to the Redco Buyer on the Crab Orchard Site. 
 Goodyear Site 
 The Goodyear Site was operated by UniDynamics/Phoenix, Inc. UPI ), which became an indirect subsidiary in 1985 when Crane Co. (n/k/a Redco) acquired UPI s parent company, UniDynamics Corporation. UPI was an indirect subsidiary of Crane Holdings, Co. pre-Separation and became an indirect subsidiary of Crane Company following completion of the Separation. UPI manufactured explosive and pyrotechnic compounds, including components for critical military programs, for the U.S. Government at the Goodyear Site from 1962 to 1993, under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other government agencies and certain of their prime contractors. In 1990, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued administrative orders requiring UPI to design and conduct certain remedial actions, which UPI has done. Groundwater extraction and treatment systems have been in operation at the Goodyear Site since 1994. On July 26, 2006, we entered a consent decree with the EPA with respect to the Goodyear Site providing for, among other things, a work plan for further investigation and remediation activities (inclusive of a supplemental remediation investigation and feasibility study). During the third quarter of 2014, the EPA issued a Record of Decision ROD amendment permitting, among other things, additional source area remediation resulting in us recording a charge of million, extending the accrued costs through 2022. Following the 2014 ROD amendment, we continued our remediation activities and explored an alternative strategy to accelerate remediation of the site. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we received conceptual agreement from the EPA on our alternative remediation strategy which is expected to further reduce the contaminant plume. Accordingly, in 2019, we recorded a pre-tax charge of million, net of reimbursements, to extend our forecast period through 2027 and reflect our revised workplan. The remediation of the PGA North Site comprises main remedial components: a plume management and remediation system (in accordance with the requirements of the 2006 Consent Decree) and source area remediation (to comply with the requirements of the 2014 ROD Amendment). The 2019 conceptual agreement and modified remedial approach focused on enhanced extraction of contaminated groundwater and targeted reinjection of treated groundwater and was designed to accelerate remedial progress at the site. The modified remedial approach required certain capital investments and infrastructure upgrades across the broader plume area, with the final components of this approach

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and as described below, a portion is reimbursable by the U.S. Government. The current portion of the total estimated liability was million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represents our best estimate, in consultation with our technical advisors, of total remediation costs expected to be paid during the next twelve-month period. It is not possible at this point to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation in excess of our current accruals through the 2027 forecast period because of the aforementioned uncertainties, in particular, the continued significant changes in the Goodyear Site conditions and additional expectations of remediation activities experienced in recent years. 
 On July 31, 2006, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy pursuant to which, among other things, the U.S. Government reimburses us for of qualifying costs of investigation and remediation activities at the Goodyear Site. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded a receivable of million and million, respectively, for the expected reimbursements from the U.S. Government in respect of the aggregate liability as at that date. The receivable is reduced as reimbursements and other payments from the U.S. Government are received. 
 Other Environmental Matters 
 Roseland, NJ Site 
 The Roseland Site was operated by Resistoflex Corporation Resistoflex ), which became an indirect subsidiary in 1985 when Crane Co. (n/k/a Redco) acquired Resistoflex s parent company, UniDynamics Corporation. Resistoflex manufactured specialty lined pipe and fittings at the site from the 1950s until it was closed in the mid-1980s. We undertook an extensive soil remediation effort at the Roseland Site following our closure and had been monitoring the Site s condition in the years that followed. In response to changes in remediation standards, in 2014 we began to conduct further site characterization and delineation studies at the Site. We have completed a comprehensive delineation of contaminants of concern in soil, groundwater, surface water, sediment, and indoor air in certain buildings, as well as required soil and groundwater remediation at the site all in accordance with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection guidelines and directives. We submitted our remediation completion reports to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and are awaiting feedback and acceptance. We anticipate that only periodic monitoring will be required at the site for the near to medium term. 
 Marion, IL Site 
 Crane Co. (n/k/a Redco) has been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP with respect to environmental contamination at the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge Superfund Site (the Crab Orchard Site ). The Crab Orchard Site is located near Marion, Illinois, and consists of approximately acres. Beginning in 1941, the United States used the Crab Orchard Site for the production of ordnance and other related products for use in World War II. In 1947, about half of the Crab Orchard Site was leased to a variety of industrial tenants whose activities (which continue to this day) included manufacturing ordnance and explosives. UniDynamics Corporation formerly leased portions of the Crab Orchard Site and conducted manufacturing operations at the Crab Orchard Site from 1952 until 1964. General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, Inc. GD-OTS is in the process of conducting a remedial investigation and feasibility study RI-FS for portions of the Crab Orchard Site, which include areas where UniDynamics maintained operations, pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent (the AOC ). A remedial investigation report was approved in February 2015, and work on the feasibility study is underway. It is unclear when the final feasibility study will be completed, or when a final Record of Decision ROD may be issued. As noted above, we have agreed to indemnify Redco against the Crab Orchard environmental liabilities, and accordingly we act as Redco s agent with respect to such liabilities. 
 GD-OTS asked Crane Co. (n/k/a Redco) to participate in a voluntary, multi-party mediation exercise with respect to response costs that GD-OTS has incurred or will incur in performing its obligations under the AOC, and Crane Co. (n/k/a Redco), the U.S. Government, and other PRPs entered into a non-binding mediation agreement in 2015 (we have since stepped into Redco s position as a participant in the mediation). The first phase of the mediation, involving certain former munitions or ordnance

 victims of a 2021 chemical leak incident that occurred at a LyondellBasell facility in La Porte, Texas. The multi-district lawsuits were consolidated for proceedings in state court in Harris County, Texas, and have been pending since 2021, when the initial set of defendants were sued. Crane is alleged to have manufactured a valve involved in the incident. Plaintiffs also added other defendants to the suits in July 2023 who allegedly either sold or serviced the subject valve or a valve accessory, and discovery for the newly added defendants began moving forward in February 2024. Crane has valid defenses, and insurance coverage that attaches after a modest self-insured retention. All of our insurance providers have been notified of this potential liability and have been cooperating with Crane as it engages in the litigation process. We have entered into a preliminary agreement to settle with a portion of the claimants. There is still uncertainty related to the ongoing litigation with the remaining claimants. We have recognized a liability as of September 30, 2024 for the settled claims, as well as an estimate for the remaining claims. The amount recognized to date and the ultimate settlement of the remaining claims is not expected to be material to Crane's financial statements. In conjunction with the liability, a corresponding receivable was recorded as these matters are fully insured. There is no material loss related to this matter as it is covered by insurance. 
 We regularly review the status of lawsuits, claims and proceedings that have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, including government contracting violations, patent infringement, commercial, employment, employee benefits, environmental and stockholder matters. We record a provision for a liability for such matters when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions, if any, are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as additional information becomes available. If either or both of the criteria are not met, we assess whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional losses, may have been incurred. If there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred for such matters, we disclose the estimate of the amount of loss or range of loss, disclose that the amount is immaterial, or disclose that an estimate of loss cannot be made, as applicable. Other than as stated above, there were no additional liabilities to report.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains information about Crane Company some of which includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements about our current condition. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of terms such as believes, contemplates, expects, may, could, should, would, or anticipates, other similar phrases, or the negatives of these terms. 
 
 Reference herein to Crane, the Company, we, us and our refer to Crane Company and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically states or implies otherwise. References to changes in core sales or core growth in this report include the change in sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures from closing up to the first anniversary, of such acquisitions or divestitures. Amounts in the following discussion are presented in millions, except employee, share and per share data, or unless otherwise stated. 
 
 We have based the forward-looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about us and the markets we serve. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the discussion in Part I, the information set forth under Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: 
 
 The effect of changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including financial market conditions, end markets for our products, fluctuations in raw material prices, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and access to key raw materials, higher interest rates and the financial condition of our customers and suppliers; 
 Economic, social and political instability, currency fluctuation and other risks of doing business outside of the United States; 
 The impact of commercial air traffic levels which are affected by a different array of factors including general economic conditions and global corporate travel spending, or terrorism; 
 Competitive pressures, including the need for technology improvement, successful new product development and introduction and any inability to pass increased costs of raw materials to customers;

 Recent Transactions and Events 
 Marion Site Hurricane and Recovery 
 In September 2024, our manufacturing site in Marion, North Carolina was directly affected by flooding from Hurricane Helene. Our insurance generally covers the repair or replacement of assets that suffered damage or loss and also provides business interruption coverage, including lost profits, and reimbursement for other expenses and costs that have been incurred relating to the damages and losses suffered. The extent of the damage to the facility is still being assessed but the loss, net of insurance recoveries is not expected to be material. The recovery related to business interruption will be recognized when realized and received. We are working with our insurance carrier to assess the damage and ascertain the amount of insurance recoveries due to us as a result of the damage and loss we incurred, as such the timing of insurance proceeds may lag behind actual losses incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred losses of 3.7 million related to the write-off of damaged property, equipment and inventory and have recorded an insurance receivable of 3.2 million, which is net of the 0.5 million deductible. These costs and insurance recoveries are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Acquisitions 
 Effective May 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of CryoWorks, Inc. CryoWorks for 60.7 million on a cash-free and debt-free basis. On April 29, 2024, we borrowed approximately 50 million under the Company s existing Revolving Facility to fund the CryoWorks acquisition. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company received 1.6 million from the seller related to a final working capital adjustment. CryoWorks, a leading supplier of vacuum insulated pipe systems for hydrogen and cryogenic applications, has been integrated into the Process Flow Technologies segment. 
 On January 2, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Vian Enterprises, Inc. Vian for 102.5 million on a cash-free and debt-free basis subject to potential additional payments of up to 7.5 million depending on the resolution of outstanding contingencies. On January 2, 2024, we borrowed 100 million under the Company s existing Revolving Facility to fund the Vian acquisition. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company received 3.0 million from the seller related to a final working capital adjustment. Vian, a global designer and manufacturer of multi-stage lubrication pumps and lubrication system components technology for critical aerospace and defense applications with sole-sourced and proprietary content on the highest volume commercial and military aircraft platforms, has been integrated into the Aerospace Electronics segment. 
 Outlook 
 Our sales depend heavily on industries that are cyclical in nature or are subject to market conditions, which may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile and unpredictable. Demand in these industries is affected by fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions, as well as currency fluctuations, commodity costs, and a variety of other factors. 
 For 2024, we expect a total year-over-year sales increase of approximately 11 , driven by approximately 5 to 7 core growth, and approximately 5 sales contribution from the Baum, Vian and CryoWorks acquisitions. We expect an improvement in operating profit driven primarily by lower transaction related expenses, productivity benefits, operating leverages on higher volumes, higher pricing net of inflation and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable mix. 
 Aerospace Electronics 
 In 2024, we expect Aerospace Electronics sales to increase in the mid-teens range compared to 2023, and inclusive of a 5 contribution from the Vian Enterprises, Inc. acquisition. We expect a substantial improvement in our commercial OEM business driven by higher aircraft build rates, and we expect an improvement in our commercial aftermarket business given continued recovery in airline flight hours. We expect our defense OEM sales to grow modestly, but the defense aftermarket businesses are expected to grow significantly given continued global geopolitical uncertainty which is driving increased demand to replace legacy product sales. We expect segment operating profit and operating margin to increase compared to 2023 driven primarily by the impact of operating leverage on higher volumes, higher pricing and productivity benefits. 
 Process Flow Technologies 
 In 2024, we expect Process Flow Technologies sales to increase low double-digits driven by contribution from the Baum lined piping GmbH and CryoWorks acquisitions, along with a mid-single digit increase in core sales. 
 We expect Process Valves and Related Products sales to increase in the low double-digit range compared to 2023, driven by mid- to high-single digit contribution from acquisitions, with mid-single digit cores sales growth driven primarily by sales to chemical and pharmaceutical end markets. We expect Commercial Valves sales to increase in the low- to mid-teens range as end markets in the U.K. begin to improve from the depressed levels, and we expect Pumps and Systems sales to increase

 in the low-single digit range compared to 2023. We expect an improvement in segment operating profit and operating margin compared to 2023, driven primarily by productivity, higher pricing net of inflation, partially offset by unfavorable mix. 
 Engineered Materials 
 In 2024, we expect Engineered materials sales to decline in the mid-single digit range, and operating profit, and operating margin are expected to be lower compared to last year driven by the deleverage on lower volumes, partially offset by higher productivity.

 Results from Continuing Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 
 The following information should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. All comparisons below refer to the third quarter 2024 versus the third quarter 2023, unless otherwise specified.

Sales increased by 67.1 million, or 12.7 , to 597.2 million in 2024. The period-over-period change in sales included: 
 an increase in core sales of 31.8 million, or 6.0 , which was driven primarily by higher pricing, offset by lower volumes; 
 an increase in sales related to the BAUM, Vian and CryoWorks acquisitions of 34.0 million, or 6.4 ; and 
 favorable foreign currency translation of 1.3 million, or 0.3 . 
 Cost of sales increased by 32.3 million, or 9.9 , to 359.2 million in 2024. The increase is primarily related to the impact from the BAUM, Vian and CryoWorks acquisitions of 26.4 million, or 8.1 , unfavorable mix of 13.1 million, or 4.0 , coupled with higher material, labor and other manufacturing costs 8.6 million, or 2.6 , partially offset by strong productivity gains 13.0 million, or 4.0 , and impact from lower volumes of 3.2 million, or 1.0 . 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 5.9 million, or 4.6 , to 132.8 million in 2024, primarily driven by the impact from the BAUM, Vian and CryoWorks acquisitions. 
 Operating profit increased by 28.9 million, or 37.9 , to 105.2 million in 2024. The increase is primarily due to higher pricing net of inflation of 24.7 million, or 32.4 , strong productivity gains of 14.1 million, or 18.5 , partially offset by unfavorable mix of 13.1 million, or 17.2 . 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is lower than the prior year s comparable period primarily due to lower non-U.S. taxes and lower statutorily non-deductible costs, partially offset by the statutory U.S. deduction related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries income. 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is higher than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates higher than the United States, expenses that are statutorily non-deductible for income tax purposes and the impact of U.S. state taxes, partially offset by excess share-based compensation benefits, tax credit utilization, and the statutory U.S. deduction related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries income.

 Sales increased by 190.2 million, or 12.2 , to 1,743.7 million in 2024. The year-over-year change in sales included: 
 an increase in core sales of 99.8 million, or 6.4 , which was driven primarily by higher pricing, and to a lesser extent, higher volume; and 
 an increase in sales related to the BAUM, Vian and CryoWorks acquisitions of 88.6 million, or 5.7 . 
 Cost of sales increased by 119.0 million, or 12.6 , to 1,061.3 million in 2024. The increase is primarily related to the impact from the BAUM, Vian and CryoWorks acquisitions of 74.1 million, or 7.9 , coupled with higher material, labor and other manufacturing costs of 61.3 million, or 6.5 , unfavorable mix of 16.0 million, or 1.7 , and higher volumes of 4.5 million, or 0.5 , partially offset by strong productivity gains of 37.7 million, or 4.0 . 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 3.1 million, or 0.8 , to 391.2 million in 2024, primarily driven by a decrease in administrative expenses of 15.5 million, or 3.9 , related to the absence of expenses related to the Separation, offset by higher selling costs of 12.4 million, or 3.1 . 
 Operating profit increased by 74.3 million, or 34.3 , to 291.2 million in 2024. The increase is primarily due to strong productivity gains of 40.9 million, or 18.9 , the absence of expenses related to the Separation and net higher pricing to a lesser extent of 33.2 million, or 15.3 , coupled with higher volumes of 12.9 million, or 5.9 , and, partially offset by unfavorable mix of 16.0 million, or 7.4 . 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is lower than the prior year s comparable period primarily due to lower non-U.S. taxes and lower statutorily non-deductible costs, partially offset by the statutory U.S. deduction related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries income. 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is higher than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates higher than the United States, expenses that are statutorily non-deductible for income tax purposes and the impact of U.S. state taxes, partially offset by excess share-based compensation benefits, tax credit utilization, and the statutory U.S. deduction related to our non-U.S. subsidiaries income.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash (used for) provided by: Operating activities from continuing operations 63.8 33.9 Investing activities from continuing operations (181.6) (29.1) Financing activities 44.5 (415.7) Discontinued operations 30.5 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 1.9 (3.4) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (71.4) (383.8) 
 
 Our operating philosophy is to deploy cash provided from operating activities, when appropriate, to provide value to shareholders by reinvesting in existing businesses, by making acquisitions that will strengthen and complement our portfolio, by divesting businesses that are no longer strategic or aligned with our portfolio and where such divestitures can generate capacity for strategic investments and initiatives that further optimize our portfolio, and by paying dividends and/or repurchasing shares. At any given time, and from time to time, we may be evaluating one or more of these opportunities, although we cannot assure you if or when we will consummate any such transactions. 
 Our current cash balance, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations and borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility, is expected to be sufficient to finance our short- and long-term capital requirements, as well as to fund expected pension contributions. 
 We have available borrowing capacity of 800 million under a 5-year revolving credit facility Revolving Facility through March 2028 and a 300 million, 3-year term loan facility Term Facility through March 2026. At September 30, 2024, there was 247 million outstanding under the Term Facility and 85 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility. For more information regarding our borrowings under the Revolving Facility in connection with our acquisitions, see Recent Transactions Acquisitions above. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 63.8 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 33.9 million during the same period last year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by the 61.7 million increase in net income from continuing operations adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash items, partially offset by an increase in working capital investments of 26.1 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows relating to investing activities from continuing operations consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses. Cash used for investing activities from continuing operations was 181.6 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 29.1 million in the comparable period of 2023. The increase in cash used for investing activities is primarily related to the acquisition of Vian for 99.5 million and the acquisition of CyroWorks for 59.1 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Financing cash flows consist primarily of dividend payments to shareholders, repayments of indebtedness, proceeds from our Credit Facilities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee stock plans. During the first nine months of 2023, financing cash flows also includes activities associated with the distribution of Crane NXT, Co. in support of the Separation. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 44.5 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to cash used for financing activities of 415.7 million in the comparable period of 2023. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was driven by: 
 
 578.1 million related to the Distribution of Crane NXT, Co. in the prior year; 
 11.9 million decrease in dividends paid, reflecting a lower dividend per share established on April 3, 2023 in connection with the Separation; 
 7.5 million decrease in payments for debt issuance costs; offset by 
 118.1 million decrease in net borrowings; and
