 and a future payment contingent on the Almost Famous business achieving certain earnings before interest and tax ("EBIT") targets. In connection therewith, we recorded an initial short-term liability of and a long-term liability of as of the date of acquisition to reflect the estimated fair value of the contingent purchase price. The fair value of the contingent payments liability was estimated on the date of acquisition using the risk neutral simulation method, which included significant unobservable Level 3 inputs, such as projected EBIT over the earn-out period and a discount rate of . Changes in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The maximum consideration which can be paid over the consideration period of is and there are minimum payments required. The liability will be remeasured at each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. After the effect of closing adjustments, the total purchase price of the acquisition was .

During the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the trademark was impaired and recognized an impairment charge of for the remaining carrying value of the trademark. See Note K Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information. 
 The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805 ("Business Combinations"), which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. 
 
 The Company recorded goodwill for the acquisition based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired, which consists largely of the synergies expected from the acquisitions. For tax purposes, goodwill will be amortized over a year period. 
 
 The fair value of the trademark was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which presumes the owner of the asset avoids hypothetical royalty payments that would need to be made for the use of the asset if the asset was not owned. Key assumptions and estimates used are forecasted revenue, a royalty rate of , and a discount rate of . Such assumptions included significant unobservable inputs and changes in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The useful life of the trademark was estimated to be years and amortization for the trademark has been recorded in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the trademark was impaired and recognized an impairment charge of for the remaining carrying value of the trademark. See Note K Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information. 
 
 The fair value of the customer relationships was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. The excess earnings methodology is an income approach methodology that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the customer relationships, net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. Key assumptions and estimates used in deriving the projected cash flows are forecasted revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") margin of , customer attrition rate of , and discount rates in the range of to . Such assumptions include significant unobservable inputs and such changes in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The

 On August 13, 2024, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to one of its subsidiaries, Greats Brand Inc.

Prior to the divestiture, GREATS was part of our Direct-to-Consumer segment. 
 
 The Company determined that its minority interest in UCG does not give the Company significant influence over UCG. Consequently, the Company accounted for the investment under ASC 321, Investments Equity Securities, and elected to apply the measurement alternative, which allows the Company to initially record the investment at cost and subsequently

2023 Balance at January 1, 2023 Acquisitions Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2023 Liabilities: Contingent payment liability 
 (1) In 2024, amount consists of an adjustment of that was included as an expense related to the change in valuation of the contingent payment liability in connection with the acquisition of Almost Famous. The adjustment was recorded in the Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the contingent payment liability was and , respectively, in connection with the October 20, 2023 acquisition of Almost Famous. The fair value of the contingent payments was estimated using a risk neutral simulation method to model the probability of different financial results of Almost Famous during the earn-out period, utilizing a discount rate of and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The change in valuation for the contingent payment liability was a result of updates to the forecasted operating results for the earn-out period. 
 
 The fair values of goodwill and intangibles are measured on a non-recurring basis and are determined using Level 3 inputs, including forecasted cash flows, discount rates, and implied royalty rates (see Note C Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Purchases and Sales of Joint Ventures and Note K Goodwill and Intangible Assets ). 
 
 The fair values of lease right-of-use assets and fixed assets related to company-owned retail stores are measured on a non-recurring basis and are determined using Level 3 inputs, including estimated discounted future cash flows associated with the assets using sales trends, market rents and market participant assumptions (see Note F Leases). 
 
 The carrying value of certain financial instruments such as cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, factor accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of their underlying terms. Fair value of the notes receivable held by the Company approximates their carrying value based upon their imputed or actual interest rate, which approximates applicable current market interest rates. Some assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (non-recurring). These assets can include long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when impaired. Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.

 Note H Net Income Per Share of Common Stock 
 
 shares for the period ended September 30, 2024, compared to shares for the period ended September 30, 2023. Diluted net income per share reflects: (a) the potential dilution assuming shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of outstanding in-the-money options and the assumed proceeds, which are deemed to be the proceeds from the exercise plus compensation cost not yet recognized attributable to future services using the treasury method, were used to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at the average market price during the period, and (b) the vesting of granted non-vested restricted stock awards for which the assumed proceeds upon vesting are deemed to be the amount of compensation cost not yet recognized attributable to future services using the treasury stock method, to the extent dilutive. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. Basic net income per share Diluted net income per share Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic Effect of dilutive securities: Stock awards and options to purchase shares of common stock Diluted 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, options to purchase approximately and shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share as the result would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, options to purchase approximately and shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share as the result would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and restricted shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share, as compared to approximately and shares that were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the result would have been anti-dilutive. The Company had contingently issuable performance awards outstanding that did not meet the performance conditions as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and, therefore, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The number of potentially dilutive shares that could be issued upon vesting for these performance awards were immaterial as of both September 30, 2024 and 2023. These amounts were also excluded from the computation of weighted average potentially dilutive securities.

 The difference between the Company s effective tax rates of and and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, is primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates. 
 
 The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits, and interest and penalty expense are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. for federal, state, and local purposes, and in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company's tax years 2021 through 2023 remain open to examination by most taxing authorities. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was signed into law, which contains certain revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15 corporate minimum income tax for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. While the 15 corporate minimum income tax has no effect on the Company s results of operations in the near term, we will continue to evaluate its impact on future years. The IRA also assesses a 1 excise tax on repurchases of corporate stock which impacts the Company s stock repurchases effective January 1, 2023. The excise tax is recorded as an incremental cost in treasury stock on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has implemented the global minimum tax rate of at least 15 for large multinational companies as of 2024 Pillar Two ). Under Pillar Two, a top-up tax will be required for any jurisdiction that has enacted Pillar Two and whose effective tax rate falls below the 15 global minimum rate. Additionally, the OECD issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. Under the safe harbor, companies would be excluded from Pillar Two requirements provided certain criteria are met. Based on preliminary analysis, the enactment of Pillar Two legislation is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position. The Company will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such legislative changes in future periods, as appropriate.

 The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted, which requires several assumptions. The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on the historical experience of similar awards. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The dividend yield is based on the Company's annualized dividend per share amount divided by the Company's stock price. The following weighted average assumptions were used for stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 secured revolving credit agreement (as amended to date, the Credit Agreement with various lenders and Citizens Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Agent ), which replaced the Company s existing credit facility provided by Rosenthal Rosenthal, Inc. Rosenthal ). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility scheduled to mature on July 22, 2025. 
 The initial maximum availability under the Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation consisting of certain eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables, inventory, and in-transit inventory. Availability under the Credit Facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit. The Company may from time-to-time increase the maximum availability under the Credit Agreement by up to if certain conditions are satisfied. 
 On March 25, 2022, an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment replaced the London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR with the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index BSBY as the interest rate benchmark. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to a specified margin, which is based upon the average availability under the Credit Facility from time to time, plus, at the Company s election (i) BSBY for the applicable interest period, or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the prime rate announced by the Agent, (b) the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus , and (c) the sum of the one-month BSBY rate plus ). Furthermore, the Amendment reduced the specified margin used to determine the interest rate under the Credit Agreement and reduced the commitment fee paid by the Company to the Agent, for the account of each lender. Additionally, the Amendment reduced the frequency of the Company s borrowing base reporting requirements when no loans are outstanding. The Amendment also extended the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to March 20, 2027. As amended on April 3, 2023, on October 23, 2023, the Credit Agreement was further amended to accommodate changes made to the Company s factoring arrangement with CIT pursuant to the Notification Factoring Rider as described in Note P Factoring Agreements. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, the Company must also pay (i) a commitment fee to the Agent, for the account of each lender, which accrues at a rate equal to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the commitment of such lender, (ii) a letter of credit participation fee to the Agent, for the account of each lender, ranging from to per annum, based upon average availability under the Credit Facility from time to time, multiplied by the average daily amount available to be drawn under the applicable letter of credit, and (iii) a letter of credit fronting fee to each issuer of a letter of credit under the Credit Agreement, which will accrue at a rate per annum separately agreed upon between the Company and such issuer. 
 The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. Among other requirements, availability under the Credit Facility must, at all times, (i) prior to the occurrence of the permanent borrowing base trigger (as defined in the Credit Agreement), equal or exceed the greater of and of the line cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (ii) after the occurrence of the permanent borrowing base trigger, equal or exceed the greater of and of the line cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Other than this minimum availability requirement, the Credit Agreement does not include any financial maintenance covenants. 
 The Credit Agreement requires the Company and various subsidiaries of the Company to guarantee each other s obligations arising from time to time under the Credit Facility, as well as obligations arising in respect of certain cash management and hedging transactions. Subject to customary exceptions and limitations, all borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and each subsidiary guarantor. 
 The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Credit Agreement occurs and is continuing, then the Agent may, and at the request of the required lenders shall, terminate the loan commitments under the Credit Agreement, declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, or require the Company to adequately cash collateralize outstanding letter of credit obligations. If the Company or, with certain exceptions, a subsidiary becomes the subject of a proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar law, then the loan commitments under the Credit Agreement will automatically terminate, and any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement and the cash collateral required under the Credit Agreement for any outstanding letter of credit obligations will become immediately due and payable.

As with monies due and to become due under the Factoring Agreement generally, monies due and to become due to the Company and DMFA under the Notification Factoring Rider are pledged in favor of the Agent to secure obligations under or in connection with the Credit Agreement.

 Recent Developments 
 
 On August 13, 2024, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to one of its subsidiaries, Greats Brand Inc. ("GREATS " ), to an unrelated third party, Unified Commerce Group Ltd. ("UCG"), in exchange for a minority interest in UCG with an estimated fair value of approximately 4,020. The Company determined that GREATS met the definition of a business under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The transaction resulted in the deconsolidation of GREATS from the consolidated financial statements and the recognition of a loss on sale in the amount of 3,199, which was included within operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Prior to the divestiture, GREATS was part of our Direct-to-Consumer segment. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company decided to discontinue the use of its Almost Famous brand and transition its marketing and sales efforts under the Madden Girl brand. As a result of this decision, the Company reassessed the carrying amount of its Almost Famous trademark for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that the estimated future cash flows related to the Almost Famous trademark was less than its carrying value, and therefore, the asset was impaired. As such, the Company recognized an impairment charge of 8,635, representing the remaining carrying amount of the asset, which was recorded within Impairment of intangibles in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Prior to writing off the Almost Famous trademark, it was recorded within our Wholesale Apparel/Accessories segment.

Economic Conditions and Industry Trends 
 
 The global economy and retail sector are influenced by a range of factors. Ongoing economic challenges, especially persistent inflation, high interest rates, substantial foreign currency fluctuations, bank failures, and recession fears continue to affect consumer discretionary income, spending habits, and overall sentiment in the U.S. and beyond. In response to these pressures, many retailers, particularly in the U.S., have adopted more promotional strategies to combat declines in foot traffic and boost conversion rates, while also addressing high inventory levels. 
 
 The department store sector has seen significant changes, including consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies, and an increase in store closures. The geopolitical landscape remains uncertain, with over 60 countries, including the U.S., set to hold national elections in 2024. These elections could lead to shifts in international trade relations, legislative changes (including tax and import regulations), and potential diplomatic tensions, all of which may negatively affect the global economy and our business performance. 
 
 Ongoing military conflicts, notably the wars in Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas, as well as recent violence in the Middle East and attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea, have also had a detrimental impact on the global economy. Although our voluntary suspension of operations in Russia and our limited presence in Israel have not materially affected our financial statements, the broader economic ramifications of these conflicts such as inflation, unfavorable currency exchange rates, rising energy prices, food shortages, and financial market volatility have influenced consumer confidence and sentiment. While the Red Sea crisis has led to some shipping delays, its long-term effects on inventory receipt and freight costs remain uncertain. 
 
 In light of these challenges, we are executing the following key strategic initiatives, which are aimed at driving growth and improving operational efficiency: 
 
 Product Diversification: Expanding our product offerings across various categories, including footwear, accessories, and apparel, to attract a broader customer base. 
 Digital Expansion: Enhancing our online presence remains a priority, with investments in e-commerce capabilities and digital marketing to increase direct-to-consumer sales. 
 Sustainability Focus: Committing to sustainability initiatives, incorporating eco-friendly materials and practices into our product lines to meet consumer demand for responsible fashion. 
 Global Market Penetration: Looking to strengthen our international footprint, exploring opportunities in key global markets to capture additional revenue streams. 
 Operational Efficiency: Efforts to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve supply chain management are ongoing, aimed at enhancing overall profitability. 
 Brand Building: Continued investment in marketing and brand positioning to elevate the Steven Madden brand and engage with consumers effectively.

Gross profit in the first nine months of 2024 was 237,581, or 63.5 of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, compared to 214,693, or 62.4 of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a reduction in promotional activity. Operating expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were 221,317, or 59.1 of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, as compared to 198,870, or 57.8 of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was attributable to higher marketing expense and occupancy related costs, partially offset by savings in logistics and fulfillment expenses. The first nine months of 2024 operating expenses also included an expense of 3,199 related to a loss on the divestiture of a business and 2,268 related to acquisition costs and the formation of joint ventures. In the same period of 2023, operating expenses included 259 of expense related to certain severances, termination benefits, a corporate office relocation, and a benefit of 2,174 related to the dissolution of an entity in Asia. In the 2024 period, we also recorded a charge of 1,700 related to the impairment of an intangible. In the first nine months of 2024, income from operations for the Direct-to-Consumer segment was 14,564, or 3.9 of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, as compared to 15,823, or 4.6 of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, in the same period last year. 
 
 Licensing Segment: 
 
 Royalty income generated by the Licensing segment accounted for 7,163, or 0.4 of total revenue, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 7,448, or 0.5 of total revenue, in the first nine months of 2023. Operating expenses decreased to 1,239 in the current period compared to 2,201 in the same period of the prior year. Income from the Licensing segment was 5,924 in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 5,247 in the same period last year. 
 
 Corporate: 
 
 Corporate does not constitute a reportable segment and includes costs not directly attributable to the segments. These costs are primarily related to expenses associated with corporate executives, corporate finance, corporate social responsibility, legal, human resources, information technology, cyber security, and other shared services. Corporate operating expenses amounted to 72,781 or 4.3 of total revenue in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 66,836 or 4.6 of total revenue in the same period last year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled 150,478 and 219,813 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024, 104,674, or approximately 70 , was held in our foreign subsidiaries, and of the total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on December 31, 2023, 134,745, or approximately 61 , was held in our foreign subsidiaries. 
 On July 22, 2020, we entered into a 150,000, five-year, asset-based revolving credit facility with various lenders and Citizens Bank, N.A (the Credit Agreement ). On March 25, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which replaced the London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR with the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index BSBY as the interest rate benchmark, among other changes. On April 3, 2023, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement, which reflects CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc. CIT as an additional receivables collection agent for us and certain guarantors. Further, on October 23, 2023, we entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement in order to accommodate certain changes made to our existing factoring arrangement with CIT. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 491,880, cash and cash equivalents of 139,414, short-term investments of 11,064, no cash borrowing, and 504 in letters of credit outstanding unrelated to the Credit Agreement. 
 We believe that based on our current financial position and available cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, we will meet all our financial commitments and operating needs for at least the next twelve months. In addition, our 150,000 asset-based revolving credit facility provides us with additional liquidity and flexibility on a long-term basis. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 A summary of our cash provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities was as follows: 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operations was 94,245 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 77,756 in the same period of the prior year. The increase in cash provided by operations, as presented in the statement of cash flow, was primarily driven by favorable changes in accounts payable, impairment of intangibles, and net income, partially offset by unfavorable changes in inventories and receivables. 

Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 16,715 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of purchases of 12,840 of short-term investments; capital expenditures of 16,642 for leasehold improvements, new stores, and systems enhancements; the acquisition of a hosiery business for 4,259 partially offset by 16,654 from the proceeds of sales of short-term investments. 

Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 140,582, which primarily consisted of share repurchases and net settlements of stock awards of 95,788, as well as cash dividends paid of 45,880. 
 
 36 

Contractual Obligations 
 
 Our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Payment due by period Contractual Obligations Total Remainder of 2024 2025-2026 2027-2028 2029 and after Operating lease obligations (1) 
 184,366 13,467 88,982 49,024 32,893 Purchase obligations 245,573 187,526 58,047 Future minimum royalty and advertising payments (2) 
 13,500 1,500 6,000 6,000 Transition tax 4,884 4,884 Total 448,323 207,377 153,029 55,024 32,893 
 (1) Refer to Note F Leases to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for further information. 
 (2) Refer to Note M Commitments, Contingencies and Other to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for further information. 
 Substantially all our products are produced by independent manufacturers at overseas locations, the majority of which are located in China, with a growing percentage located in Cambodia, Mexico, Vietnam, India, Italy, Brazil, Tunisia, and various other European and Asian countries. We have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply contracts with any of these foreign manufacturers. We believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist outside of the United States for the manufacture of our products. Purchases are made primarily in United States dollars. 
 As of the date of this report, we have employment agreements with our Founder and Creative and Design Chief, Steven Madden, and certain executive officers, which provide for the payment of compensation aggregating to approximately 2,672 through the remainder of 2024, 10,368 in 2025, 9,396 in 2026, 8,589 in 2027, 8,549 in 2028, 7,942 in 2029, and 7,746 in each of the years 2030 and 2031. In addition, some of these employment agreements provide for incentive compensation based on various performance criteria and some provide for discretionary bonuses as well as other benefits, including stock-based compensation. 
 Transition tax of 4,884 was the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"). Excluded from the contractual obligations table above are long-term taxes payable of 238 as of September 30, 2024 primarily related to an uncertain tax position, for which we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond one year due to uncertainties in the timing and outcome of tax audits. 
 Dividends 
 On November 6, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend. The quarterly dividend of 0.21 per share is payable on December 27, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 13, 2024. 
 
 Future quarterly cash dividend payments are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and contingent upon future earnings, our financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors. Therefore, we can give no assurance that dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock in the future. 

Inflation 
 
 Actual results could be negatively and materially impacted due to risks and uncertainties, including the impacts of inflationary pressures globally and the war in Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, and the related broader macroeconomic implications. Consumer spending has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by inflationary pressures, and other macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. All these factors have negatively impacted, and might continue to negatively impact, our direct sales to end consumers and our sales to our wholesale customers. Historically, we have minimized the impact of product, wages, and logistic cost increases by raising prices, renegotiating costs, changing suppliers, and improving operating efficiencies. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future. 
 
 37 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In addition to the commitments included in the Contractual Obligations table above, we have outstanding letters of credit of 504 outstanding as of September 30, 2024 related to the purchase of inventory. These letters of credit expire at various dates through 2030. 
 We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note M Commitments, Contingencies and Other to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for further information. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and the Use of Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and the use of estimates from the disclosures reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 in thousands) 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We do not engage in the trading of market risk sensitive instruments in the normal course of business. Our financing arrangements are subject to variable interest rates, primarily based on the prime rate and the BSBY. The terms of our 150,000 asset-based revolving credit agreement (the Credit Facility and our collection agency agreements with Rosenthal Rosenthal, Inc. and CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc. can be found in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 2 and in Note O Credit Agreement and Note P Factoring Agreements, respectively, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report. Because we had no cash borrowings under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, a 10 change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have an immaterial effect on our reported interest expense. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held short-term investments valued at 11,064, which consist of certificates of deposit. We have the ability to hold these investments until maturity. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We face market risk to the extent that our U.S. or foreign operations involve the transaction of business in foreign currencies. In addition, our inventory purchases are primarily done in foreign jurisdictions and inventory purchases may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currencies of our contract manufacturers, which could have the effect of increasing the cost of goods sold in the future. We manage these risks primarily by denominating these purchases in U.S. dollars. To mitigate the risk of purchases, that are denominated in foreign currencies, we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts for terms of no more than two years. A description of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note L Derivative Instruments to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling 63,086. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign exchange contracts that were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, a 10 increase or decrease of the U.S. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under forward foreign exchange contracts, with all other variables held constant, would result in a net increase or decrease in the fair value of our derivatives portfolio of approximately 64, which is immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In addition, we are exposed to translation risk in connection with our foreign operations in Canada, Mexico, Latin America, Europe, South Africa, China, Taiwan, Israel, Malaysia, and the Middle East because our subsidiaries and joint ventures in these countries utilize the local currency as their functional currency, and those financial results are translated into U.S. dollars. As currency exchange rates fluctuate, foreign currency exchange rate translation adjustments reflected in our financial statements with respect to our foreign operations affects the comparability of financial results between years. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflationary factors generally affect us by reducing consumer spending, increasing our labor and overhead costs, and negatively impacting our direct sales to end consumers and our sales to our wholesale customers, which may adversely affect our results of operations, and financial position. We have historically been able to minimize the impacts of inflation by raising prices, renegotiating costs, changing suppliers, and improving operating efficiencies. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary impacts in the future. 
 39 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were, as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report, effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated our internal controls over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, due to the timing of the closing of the acquisition, our management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Turn On Products Inc. d/b/a Almost Famous, which we acquired on October 20, 2023. The acquired business constituted 8.0 of consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2024, and 7.5 of consolidated total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Otherwise, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 40 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we have various pending cases involving contractual disputes, employee-related matters, distribution matters, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, and other matters. In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, the liabilities, if any, resulting from these legal proceedings should not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 You are encouraged to review the discussion of Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors appearing in this report at Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results, earnings, or stock price, in various ways. The risks described in the 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K.
