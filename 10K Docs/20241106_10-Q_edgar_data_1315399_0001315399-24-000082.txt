 On at least a quarterly basis, we review all debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position for a credit loss. An investment security is deemed impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. Amortized cost includes adjustments (if any) made to the cost basis of an investment for accretion, amortization, and previous other-than-temporary impairments. For individual debt securities classified as available for sale, we determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. If the decline in fair value is due to credit, we will record the portion of the impairment loss relating to credit through an allowance for credit losses. Impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. 
 
 The Company s unrealized loss for the debt securities classified as available for sale is comprised of securities in the less than 12 months loss position and securities in the 12 months or greater loss position at September 30, 2024. These securities are mortgage-backed securities that had unrealized losses issued or guaranteed by the US government or US government sponsored entities. The unrealized losses associated with those mortgage-backed securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates and are not due to credit losses given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government. Because the Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, the Company does not consider the unrealized loss in these securities to be credit losses at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company classifies the held-to-maturity debt securities into the following major security types: residential mortgage backed, and state and political subdivisions. These securities are highly rated with a history of no credit losses, and are assigned ratings based on the most recent data from ratings agencies depending on the availability of data for the security. Credit ratings of held-to-maturity debt securities, which are a significant input in calculating the expected credit loss, are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Based on the credit ratings of our held-to-maturity securities and our historical experience including no losses, we have determined that an allowance for credit loss on the held-to-maturity portfolio is not required. Because the Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, the Company does not consider the unrealized loss in these securities to be credit losses at September 30, 2024.

 Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures 
 
 The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted through the provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was thousand and thousand, respectively, on exposures totaling million and million, respectively. The provision (recovery) for credit losses on off balance sheet exposures during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 were ) thousand and thousand, and and ) thousand, respectively.

During the quarter, the increase to the Commercial Owner Occupied portfolio was due to an increase in the portfolio balance that increased the loan exposure and also caused changes to the qualitative factors related to concentration levels within the portfolio segments. The decrease to the Commercial Non-Owner Occupied is due to a decrease in problem loan qualitative factor, partially offset by an increase in the economic condition factor. The decrease in the Residential 1 to 4 Family Investment portfolio is due to a downward adjustment of the derived historical loss rate which better reflects the problem loan risk of loss of the portfolio. 
 
 For the year to date, the increase in the Construction, Commercial Owner Occupied, and Residential Multifamily portfolios was due to increases in the portfolio balances that increased the loan exposure and also caused changes to the qualitative factors related to concentration levels within the portfolio segments. The decrease to the Commercial Non-Owner Occupied portfolios was due to a decrease in the portfolios internally classified problem loan balance that decreased the problem loan qualitative factor.

 During the quarter, the increase to the Residential 1 to 4 Family and Residential 1 to 4 Family Investment portfolio's was due to 
 an increase in the portfolio balances as well as an increase in the qualitative factor for the Residential 1 to 4 Family Residential 
 portfolio driven by an increase in delinquent loan balances. The credit provision during the quarter to the Construction segment 
 was mainly due to a decrease in the portfolio balance. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase to the provision for the Residential 1 to 4 Family portfolio was 
 mainly driven by an increase in the qualitative factor due to an increase in delinquent loan balances. The credit provision to the 
 Construction and Residential 1 to 4 Family Investment segments was largely driven by declines or slowdowns to growth within 
 the portfolio that lowered loan exposure and also caused changes to the qualitative factors related to loan volume within the 
 portfolio segments, partially offset by an increase in the balance of the Residential 1 - 4 Family Investment segment. The credit 
 provision for the Commercial Owner Occupied portfolio is attributed to a decrease in the historical vintage reserve rate.

 Credit Quality Indicators : As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company's loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to the risk grades of loans, the level of classified loans, net charge-offs, nonperforming loans (see details above) and the general economic conditions in the region. 
 
 The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each of its loans. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 7. Grades 1 through 4 are considered Pass . A description of the general characteristics of the seven risk grades is as follows: 
 
 1. Good : Borrower exhibits the strongest overall financial condition and represents the most creditworthy profile. 
 2. Satisfactory (A) : Borrower reflects a well-balanced financial condition, demonstrates a high level of creditworthiness and typically will have a strong banking relationship with the Bank. 
 3. Satisfactory (B) : Borrower exhibits a balanced financial condition and does not expose the Bank to more than a normal or average overall amount of risk. Loans are considered fully collectable. 
 4. Watch List : Borrower reflects a fair financial condition, but there exists an overall greater than average risk. Risk is deemed acceptable by virtue of increased monitoring and control over borrowings. Probability of timely repayment is present. 
 5. Other Assets Especially Mentioned (OAEM) : Financial condition is such that assets in this category have a potential weakness or pose unwarranted financial risk to the Bank even though the asset value is not currently individually evaluated. The asset does not currently warrant adverse classification but if not corrected could weaken and could create future increased risk exposure. Includes loans that require an increased degree of monitoring or servicing as a result of internal or external changes. 
 6. Substandard : This classification represents more severe cases of #5 (OAEM) characteristics that require increased monitoring. Assets are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral. Asset has a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that impairs the ability to repay debt and jeopardizes the timely liquidation or realization of the collateral at the asset s net book value. 
 7. Doubtful : Assets which have all the weaknesses inherent in those assets classified #6 (Substandard) but the risks are more severe relative to financial deterioration in capital and/or asset value; accounting/evaluation techniques may be questionable and the overall possibility for collection in full is highly improbable. Borrowers in this category require constant monitoring, are considered work-out loans and present the potential for future loss to the Bank.

million and million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was thousand and thousand, respectively, an increase of thousand, mainly due to the increase in the unused commitment balance. 
 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, standby letters of credit with customers were million and million, respectively. 
 
 On September 26, 2024, the Bank entered into an agreement with the FHLBNY for a Municipal Letter of Credit ("MLOC") of million. The MLOC is used to pledge against public deposits and the MLOC expires on December 26, 2024. There were outstanding borrowings on the letters of credit as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company also has entered into an employment contract with the President of the Company, which provides for continued payment of certain employment salary and benefits prior to the expiration date of the agreement and in the event of a change in control, as defined. The Company has also entered in Change-in-Control Severance Agreements with certain officers which provide for the payment of severance in certain circumstances following a change in control. 
 
 We provide banking services to customers that are licensed by various States to do business in the cannabis industry as growers, processors and dispensaries. Cannabis businesses are legal in these States, although they are not legal at the federal level. The U.S. Department of the Treasury s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN published guidelines in 2014 for financial institutions servicing state legal cannabis businesses. A financial institution that provides services to cannabis-related businesses can comply with Bank Secrecy Act BSA disclosure standards by following the FinCEN guidelines. We maintain stringent written policies and procedures related to the acceptance of such businesses and to the monitoring and maintenance of such business accounts. We conduct a significant due diligence review of the cannabis business before the business is accepted, including confirmation that the business is properly licensed by the applicable state. Throughout the relationship, we continue monitoring the business, including site visits, to ensure that the business continues to meet our stringent requirements, including maintenance of required licenses and periodic financial reviews of the business. 
 
 While we believe we are operating in compliance with the FinCEN guidelines, there can be no assurance that federal enforcement guidelines will not change. Federal prosecutors have significant discretion and there can be no assurance that the federal prosecutors will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis. Any change in the Federal government s enforcement position, could cause us to immediately cease providing banking services to the cannabis industry.

 Throughout this report, "Parke Bancorp" and "the Company" refer to Parke Bancorp Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company is collectively referred to as "we", "us" or "our". Parke Bank is referred to as the "Bank". 
 
 The Company may from time to time make written or oral "forward-looking statements" including statements contained in this Report and in other communications by the Company which are made in good faith pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements, such as statements of the Company's plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions, involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company's control). The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's financial performance to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements: the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which the Company conducts operations; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"), inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; the potential adverse effects of the Consent Orders and any additional regulatory restrictions that may be imposed by banking regulators; the timely development of, and acceptance of, new products and services of the Company and the perceived overall value of these products and services by users, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors' products and services; the impact of changes in financial services laws and regulations (including laws concerning taxes, banking, securities and insurance); the effect of any change in federal government enforcement of federal laws affecting the cannabis industry; technological changes; acquisitions; changes in consumer spending and saving habits; and the success of the Company at managing the risks involved in the foregoing. 
 Financial institutions can be affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets. The effects of geopolitical instability, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the war in Israel, foreign currency exchange volatility, volatility in global capital markets, inflationary pressures, and higher interest rates may meaningfully impact loan production, income levels, and the measurement of certain significant estimates such as the allowance for credit losses. Moreover, in a period of economic contraction, we may experience elevated levels of credit losses, reduced interest income, impairment of financial assets, diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources, and reduced demand for our products and services. Volatility in the housing markets, real estate values and unemployment levels results in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. Our lending relationships are primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and individual consumers residing in and around s outhern New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We focus our lending efforts primarily in three lending areas: residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and construction loans. As a result of this geographic concentration, a significant broad-based deterioration in economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse impact on the quality of our loan portfolio, results of operations and future growth potential. 
 
 Our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding our exposure to changes in the interest rate environment. Earnings and liquidity depend to a great extent on our interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions, geopolitical tensions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. The nature and timing of any changes in interest rates or general economic conditions and their effect on us cannot be controlled and are difficult to predict. If the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, could contract and be materially adversely affected. Our earnings could also be materially adversely affected if the rates on interest-earning assets fall more quickly than those on our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates could also create competitive pressures, which could impact our liquidity position. 
 
 Changes in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans, our ability to obtain and retain deposits, and the value of interest-earning assets, and the ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets, which could all negatively impact shareholder's equity and regulatory capital. 
 
 The Company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. The Company also cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's analysis only as of the date on which they are given. The Company is not obligated to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after any such date.

Overview 
 The following discussion provides information about our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and asset quality. We intend that this information facilitates your understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and results of operations. You should read this section in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 We are a bank holding company and are headquartered in Washington Township, New Jersey. Through the Bank, we provide personal and business financial services to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses primarily in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Bank has branches in Galloway Township, Northfield, Washington Township, Collingswood, New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and a loan office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The vast majority of our revenue and income is currently generated through the Bank. 
 
 We manage our Company for the long term. We are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our commitments to our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities where we do business. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships across our businesses that meet our risk/return measures. 
 
 We focus on small to mid-sized business and retail customers and offer a range of loan products, deposits services, and other financial products through our retail branches and other channels. The Company's results of operations are dependent primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning-assets and the interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities. In our operations, we have three major lines of lending: residential real estate mortgage, commercial real estate mortgage, and construction lending. Our interest income is primarily generated from our lending and investment activities. Our deposit products include checking, savings, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. T he majority of our deposit accounts are obtained through our retail banking business, which provides us with low cost funding to grow our lending efforts. The Company also generates income from loan and deposit fees and other non-interest related activities. The Company's non-interest expense primarily consists of employee compensation, administration, and other operating expenses. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 2.07 billion, and total equity of 296.5 million. Net income available to common shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.5 million and 20.1 million, respectively. 

Results of Operations 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net Income : Our net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2024 increased 6.5 million, or 634.1 , to 7.5 million, compared to 1.0 million for the same period last year. Earnings per share were 0.63 per basic common share and 0.62 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.09 per basic common share and 0.08 per diluted common share for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in non-interest expense and an increase in interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense, and a decrease in non-interest income. 
 
 Net Interest Income : Our net interest income was 14.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 15.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 1.0 million, or 6.1 . Net interest income decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits and borrowings, partially offset by an increase in interest and fees on loans. Interest income increased 3.0 million, or 10.3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of 2.9 million in interest and fees on loans, due to higher loan balances and market interest rates. The increase in interest income was offset by an increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 4.0 million, or 29.5 , primarily due to an increase in market interest rates on deposits and the overall mix of deposits of 3.6 million, and increase in market interest rates. 
 
 Provision for credit losses : For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was a recovery of 0.1 million, compared to a provision of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision recovery for the 
 25 

three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease in the 1 - 4 family investment property loan portfolio qualitative factor rate from the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-interest Income : Our non-interest income was 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.9 million, compared to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in service fees on deposit accounts of 0.7 million due to a decrease in cannabis deposit fee income, and a decrease in other non-interest income of 0.3 million. 
 
 Non-interest Expense : Our non-interest expense decreased 9.5 million, or 59.8 , to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a non-recurring 9.5 million loss recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax : Income tax expense was 1.9 million on income before taxes of 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.1 , compared to income tax expense of 0.3 million on income before taxes of 1.4 million for the same period of 2023, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.8 . 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income : Our net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.2 million, or 0.8 , to 20.1 million compared to 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per share were 1.68 per basic common share and 1.66 per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.70 per basic common share and 1.67 per diluted common share for the same period last year. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders primarily resulted from an decrease in net interest income of 5.6 million, an increase in provision for credit losses of 2.1 million, and a decrease in non-interest income of 2.1 million, partially offset by an decrease in non-interest expense of 9.8 million. 
 
 Net interest income : Our net interest income decreased 5.6 million, or 11.5 , to 43.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 48.7 million for the same period last year. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 9.4 million to 91.8 million, or 11.4 , from 82.4 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on loans of 9.4 million, primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and balances outstanding. Interest expense increased 15.0 million, or 44.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest paid on deposits of 14.1 million, or 50.2 , primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and a shift in deposit mix. Further contributing to the increase in interest expense was an increase in interest on borrowings of 0.9 million, or 16.2 , due to an increase in borrowing levels and higher market interest rates. 
 
 Provision for credit losses : The provision for credit losses was 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a recovery of provision for credit losses of 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the outstanding loan balance of 52.6 million from the balance at December 31, 2023, specifically in the construction 1 - 4 family, and multi-family loan portfolios . The provision recovery of 1.6 million during the same period in 2023 was primarily related to decreases in loss factors related to the construction, commercial owner occupied, and residential 1 to 4 family investment portfolios . For more information about our provision for credit losses and our allowance for loan and lease losses and loss experience, see Financial Condition-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses below and Note 4 - Loans And Allowance For Credit Losses on Loans to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Non-interest income : Our non-interest income was 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.0 million, or 39.3 , compared to 5.2 million for the same period last year. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in service fees on deposit accounts of 2.1 million. Fee income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily from commercial deposit accounts of depositors who do business in the cannabis-related industry totaled 0.8 million, compared to 2.9 million for the same period last year. Fee income is included in service fees on deposit accounts in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 Non-interest expense: Our non-interest expense decreased 9.8 million to 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 29.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a 9.5 million non-recurring loss recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 26 

Income Tax : Income tax expense was 6.5 million on income before taxes of 26.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.3 , compared to income tax expense of 6.2 million on income before taxes of 26.5 million for the same period of 2023, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.5 . 

Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income is the interest earned on investment securities, loans and other interest-earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the average yield of net interest income on average earning assets. Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. 
 The following tables presents the average daily balances of assets, liabilities and equity and the respective interest earned or paid on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as average annualized rates, for the periods indicated.

Financial Condition 
 General 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s total assets were 2.07 billion, an increase of 41.9 million, or 2.1 , from December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to an increase in loans receivable and an increase in FHLBNY restricted stock, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalent, investment securities, and other assets. Loans increased 52.6 million, primarily due to increases in the construction, multi-family, and CRE owner portfolios. FHLBNY restricted stock increased 1.0 million due to an increase in FHLBNY advances. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 7.9 million, or 4.4 , primarily due to the increase in loans, partially offset by the increase in deposits and borrowings. Other assets decreased 3.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 7.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 10.5 million at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in prepaid taxes. 
 
 Total liabilities were 1.77 billion at September 30, 2024. This represented a 29.8 million, or 1.7 , increase, from 1.74 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deposits of 6.1 million, or 0.4 , to 1.56 billion at September 30, 2024, from 1.55 billion at December 31, 2023, and an increase in borrowings of 20.1 million, or 16.0 , to 188.3 million at September 30, 2024. The increase in deposits was primarily due to an increase in brokered time deposits of 48.4 million, and time deposits of 21.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest demand deposits of 33.7 million, and a decrease in savings deposits of 25.5 million. The increase in borrowings was due to additional FHLBNY advances. 
 
 28 

Total equity was 296.5 million and 284.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, an increase of 12.1 million from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the retention of earnings, partially offset by the payment of 6.4 million of cash dividends, and the repurchase of Company common stock of 2.0 million. 
 
 The following table presents certain key condensed balance sheet data as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 : 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 172,449 180,376 (7,927) (4.4) Investment securities 15,269 16,387 (1,118) (6.8) Loans, net of unearned income 1,839,929 1,787,340 52,589 2.9 Allowance for credit losses (32,318) (32,131) (187) 0.6 Total assets 2,065,409 2,023,500 41,909 2.1 Total deposits 1,558,883 1,552,827 6,056 0.4 FHLBNY borrowings 145,000 125,000 20,000 16.0 Subordinated debt 43,253 43,111 142 0.3 Total liabilities 1,768,949 1,739,183 29,766 1.7 Total equity 296,460 284,317 12,143 4.3 Total liabilities and equity 2,065,409 2,023,500 41,909 2.1 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased 7.9 million to 172.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 180.4 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 4.4 . The decrease was primarily due to an increase in loans, partially offset by an increase in deposits and borrowings. 
 
 Investment securities 
 
 Total investment securities decreased to 15.3 million at September 30, 2024, from 16.4 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 1.1 million or 6.8 . The decrease was attributed to normal pay downs. For detailed information on the composition and maturity distribution of our investment portfolio, see NOTE 3 - Investment Securities in the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

Loans 
 
 Our lending relationships are primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and individual consumers residing in and around Southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We have also expanded our lending footprint in other areas, including New York and South Carolina. We focus our lending efforts primarily in three lending areas: residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and construction loans. 
 We originate residential mortgage loans with adjustable and fixed-rates that are secured by 1- 4 family and multifamily residential properties. These loans are generally underwritten under terms, conditions and documentation acceptable to the secondary mortgage market. A substantial majority of such loans can be pledged for potential borrowings. 
 We originate commercial real estate loans that are secured by commercial real estate properties that are owner and non-owner occupied real estate properties. These loans are typically larger in dollar size and are primarily secured by office buildings, retail buildings, warehouses and general purpose business space. The commercial mortgage loans generally have maturities of twenty years, but re-price within five years. 
 The construction loans we originate provide real estate acquisition, development and construction funds to individuals and real estate developers. The loans are secured by the properties under development. The construction loan funds are disbursed periodically at pre-specified stages of completion. 
 29 

We also originate commercial and industrial loans, which provide liquidity to businesses in the form of lines of credit and may be secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets. In addition, we have a consumer loan portfolio which provides loans to individual borrowers. 
 
 Loans receivable : Loans receivable increased to 1.84 billion at September 30, 2024, from 1.79 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 52.6 million, or 2.9 . T he increase was primarily due to increases in the construction, CRE-owner occupied, and Residential - Multifamily loan portfolios. Loans receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, consisted of the following: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount Percentage of Loans to total Loans Amount Percentage of Loans to total Loans Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Commercial and Industrial 34,812 1.9 35,451 2.0 (639) (1.8) Construction 176,534 9.6 157,556 8.8 18,978 12.0 Real Estate Mortgage: Commercial Owner Occupied 150,209 8.2 141,742 7.9 8,467 6.0 Commercial Non-owner Occupied 365,563 19.9 369,909 20.7 (4,346) (1.2) Residential 1 to 4 Family 452,723 24.6 449,682 25.2 3,041 0.7 Residential 1 to 4 Family Investment 517,777 28.1 524,167 29.3 (6,390) (1.2) Residential Multifamily 137,282 7.5 103,324 5.8 33,958 32.9 Consumer 5,029 0.3 5,509 0.3 (480) (8.7) Total Loans 1,839,929 100.0 1,787,340 100.0 52,589 2.9 

Deposits 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total deposits increased to 1.56 billion from 1.55 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 6.1 million, or 0.4 . The increase in deposits was primarily due to an increase in brokered time deposits of 48.4 million and an increase in time deposits of 21.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest demand deposits and savings deposits of 33.7 million and 25.5 million, respectively . The increase in our brokered time deposits was primarily due to our increased usage of brokered funds. The increase in our time deposit balance is primarily due to an increase in twelve month certificates of deposit of 157.8 million and an increase of 60.0 million in six month certificates of deposit, partially offset by a decrease of 120.3 million and 52.9 million in fifteen month and twenty one month certificates of deposit, respectively. The decrease in the noninterest-bearing deposit balance was primarily due to a 29.6 million decrease in cannabis checking account. The decrease in the savings deposits was primarily due to a 11.2 million decrease in our preferred savings accounts, as well as a 6.8 million and 4.0 million decrease in our platinum plus and statement savings accounts, respectively.

Borrowings 
 
 Total borrowings were 188.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 168.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in borrowings is due to an increase of 20.0 million in FHLBNY advances. At September 30, 2024, 125.0 million of the outstanding FHLBNY advances have short-term maturities. 
 
 Equity 
 
 Total equity increased to 296.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 284.3 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 12.1 million, or 4.3 , primarily due to the retention of earnings from the period, partially offset by the payment of 6.4 million of cash dividends, and the repurchase of Company common stock of 2.0 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate cash to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals, satisfy other contractual obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2024, our cash position was 172.4 million. We invest cash that is in excess of our immediate operating needs primarily in our interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve. 
 Our primary source of funding has been deposits. Funds from other operations, financing arrangements, investment securities available-for-sale also provide significant sources of funding. The Company seeks to rely primarily on core deposits from customers to provide stable and cost-effective sources of funding to support loan growth. We focus on customer service which we believe has resulted in a history of customer loyalty. Stability, low cost and customer loyalty comprise key characteristics of core deposits. 
 
 We also use brokered deposits as a funding source. The Bank joined the IntraFi Financial Network to secure an additional alternative funding source. IntraFi provides the Bank an additional source of external funds through their weekly CDARS settlement process, as well as their ICS money market product. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 13.2 million of brokered deposits sourced from IntraFi. Additionally, we have access to other brokered deposit funding sources that we utilize as a source of additional liquidity. In addition to IntraFi, we utilize Wells Fargo and Piper Sandler to obtain brokered deposits, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had 183.7 million sourced from these broker relationships. While deposit accounts comprise the vast majority of our funding needs, we maintain secured borrowing lines with the FHLBNY and the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB"). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had lines of credit with the FHLBNY of 930.5 million, of which 145.0 million was outstanding, and an additional 50.0 million from a letter of credit for securing public funds. The remaining borrowing capacity was 735.5 million at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a borrowing capacity through the FRB discount window of 76.3 million. There were no balances outstanding with the FRB as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We had outstanding loan commitments of 121.5 million at September 30, 2024. Our loan commitments are normally originated with the full amount of collateral. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The funding requirements for such commitments occur on a measured basis over time and would be funded by normal deposit growth. 
 
 The following is a discussion of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 26.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the decrease in accrued interest receivable and other assets, the increase in accrued interest payable, and the increase in provision for credit losses, partially. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 52.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in investing activities of 48.0 million in the same period last year. The increase in cash used in the investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the increase in cash outflow from the origination of loans. 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 17.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in financing activities of 21.4 million in the same period last year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to lower decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits, and the increase in FHLBNY short-term borrowings, partially offset by lower increase in interest-bearing deposits, the decrease in FHLBNY long-term borrowings, and the decrease in Federal Reserve short-term borrowings.

Capital Adequacy 
 We utilize a comprehensive process for assessing the Company s overall capital adequacy. We actively review our capital strategies in light of current and anticipated business risks, future growth opportunities, industry standards, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, earnings stability, competitive forces, economic conditions, and strength of management. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. We primarily manage our capital through the retention of earnings. We also use other means to manage our capital. Total equity increased 12.1 million at September 30, 2024, from December 31, 2023, primarily from the Company s net income of 20.1 million for the period, net of common and preferred stock dividends of 6.5 million and treasury stock repurchases of 2.0 million. 
 Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank and the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under the regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in regulatory actions. 
 Under the capital rules issued by the Federal banking agencies, the Company and the Bank elected to exclude the effects of certain Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI items from its regulatory capital calculation. At September 30, 2024, the Bank and the Company were both considered well capitalized . 
 The following table presents the tier 1 regulatory capital leverage ratios of the Company and the Bank at September 30, 2024: 
 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in thousands except ratios) Company Parke Bank Tier 1 leverage 309,806 15.46 338,926 16.91 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Company s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company s most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses : Our allowances for credit losses represents management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in our investment and loan portfolios, excluding those loans accounted for under fair value. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 Our determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors, broken down into vintage based on year of origination. These critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and other qualitative, and quantitative data. These evaluations are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change. Our allowance for credit losses is comprised of two components, a specific allowance and a general calculation. A specific allowance is calculated for loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, and include collateral dependent loans. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when foreclosure of the underlying collateral is probable. Parke has elected to apply the practical expedient to measure expected credit losses of a collateral dependent asset using the fair value of the collateral, less any estimated costs to sell, when foreclosure is not probable but repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The general based component covers loans and leases on which there are expected credit losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes 
 32 

in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, projected industry outlook, and economic conditions. 
 
 The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for loan and lease losses may be required that would reduce future earnings.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the "Exchange Act")), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms. 
 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Absecon Gardens Condominium Association v. Parke Bank Matter 
 
 Absecon Gardens Condominium Association v. Parke Bank, One Mechanic Street, et al, Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, Docket No. ATL-L-2321-21. The Company is the successor to the interests of the developer of the Absecon Gardens Condominium project in Absecon NJ. Some of the unit owners have suggested that the Company is responsible for contributions and/or repair for alleged damages purportedly relating to construction. The owners filed a Complaint, alleging that the damages total approximately 1.7 million. The matter is in discovery so it is difficult to determine whether that amount accurately reflects the claimed damages, or whether the Company is in any way culpable for the damages. At this time it is too early to predict whether an unfavorable outcome will result. The Company is vigorously defending this matter. 

Mori Restaurant LLC v. Parke Bank Matter 
 
 On May 20, 2014, Parke Bank (the "Bank") loaned Voorhees Diner Corporation ("VDC") the original principal sum of 1.0 million for purposes of tenant fit out, and operation, of the Voorhees Diner situated at 320 Route 73, Voorhees, New Jersey 08043. VDC leased the Diner property under that certain Lease with Mori Restaurant LLC ("Mori") dated May 20, 2014. In connection with the loan from the Bank and as security therefor, VDC pledged its leasehold interest to the Bank. On March 6, 2015, the loan was modified, and the principal amount of the loan was increased to 1.4 million. On January 8, 2020, the Bank declared VDC in default of its loan obligations. Judgment was entered against VDC and in favor of the Bank, and the court appointed Alan I. Gould, Esquire, as the Receiver for the Voorhees Diner Corporation. Mr. Gould subsequently caused VDC's leasehold interest in the Diner property to be sold at sheriffs sale. The Bank's REO subsidiary, 320 Route 73 LLC, was the successful bidder and took title thereto. Mori Restaurant has filed counterclaims against 320 Route 73 LLC and the Bank for rent allegedly accruing due during the period that the Receiver was in possession of the premises. As to all of Mori Restaurant s claims, the Bank defendants primary, but not exclusive, defense in this matter is that, pursuant to that certain Fee Owner Consent executed by and between Mori Restaurant and the Bank, in November 2014, the lease between VDC and Mori Restaurant was terminated as a matter of law and neither the Bank nor 320 Route 73 LLC have liability to Mori Restaurant under the lease or 
 33 

otherwise. The Bank believes this suit is without merit, denies any and all liability and intends to vigorously defend against this matter. 
 
 In the normal course of business, there are outstanding various contingent liabilities such as claims and legal action, which are not reflected in the financial statements. In the opinion of management, no material losses are anticipated as a result of these actions or claims. 
 
 Other than the foregoing, there were no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is the subject.
