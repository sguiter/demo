purchased an additional Units at per Unit pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option, generating additional
gross proceeds to the Company of . Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the Private Placement
of an aggregate of units to G-Star Management Corporation (the Sponsor at a purchase price of per Private
Placement Unit (the Private Units ), generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of (See Note 4). 

Offering
costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting commissions (which are
held in the Trust Account as defined below), and of other offering costs. As described in Note 6, the of deferred
underwriting commissions is contingent upon the consummation of a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

On
September 16, 2023, Golden Star entered into a Merger Agreement with Gamehaus Inc., Gamehaus Holdings Inc. Pubco ), and
their wholly owned subsidiaries for a business combination. The merger involves multiple steps and will result in the cancellation and
conversion of various shares into Pubco s Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares. After the closing of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement (the Closing ), Golden Star will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco. The deal is expected
to close in the first half of 2024, subject to various conditions, including shareholder approvals and regulatory clearances. Additionally,
related agreements such as the Shareholder Support Agreement, Founder Lock-Up Agreement, Seller Lock-Up Agreement, and Registration Rights
Agreements have been executed. A press release announcing the merger agreement was also issued. 

Upon
the Closing, after giving effect to the redemption and any PIPE investment that has been funded prior to or at the Closing, if any, the
combined entity shall have net tangible assets of at least . 

On
April 1, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting First Extraordinary General Meeting and approved to
change the monthly extension contribution paid by the Sponsor (or its designee) to extend the deadline for completing the initial Business
Combination from per outstanding public share, or in total per month into per outstanding public share, or in total
 per month by the 4 th of each month (the Amended Monthly Extension Fee commencing April 4, 2024. 

On
July 3, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting Second Extraordinary General Meeting and approved to
the reduction of the monthly extension contribution paid by the Sponsor (or its designee) to extend the deadline for completing the initial
Business Combination to the lesser of per outstanding public share, or in total per month commencing July 4, 2024. 

The
Trust Account 

As
of May 4, 2023, a total of of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement transaction completed with the Sponsor,
was deposited in a trust account (the Trust Account established for the benefit of the Company s public shareholders
with Wilmington Trust, National Association, acting as trustee. The amount of funds currently in the Trust Account in excess of 
and the related interest and dividends earned that are subject to redemption is available to the Company for use as its working capital. 

The
funds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of
185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), and that invest solely in United States government treasuries. Except
with respect to interest and dividends earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay income
or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of the completion of a Business
Combination or the Company s liquidation. 

In
connection with the First and Second Extraordinary General Meeting held on April 1, 2024, and July 3, 2024, holders of 
and 
ordinary shares of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately
 and 
per share, for an aggregate redemption of approximately 
and ,
respectively. The redemption payments were settled in May 2024 and July 2024 respectively. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and
 marketable
securities held in Trust Account, respectively, and there was a and
 ) overdraft of the available working
capital not subject to redemption. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital deficit of including of the available cash held in the Trust
Account for marketable securities, which indicated a lack of liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time,
which was considered to be one year from the issuance date of the unaudited financial statements. 

The
Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur
significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the issuance date of the unaudited financial statements. In
order to finance transaction cost in connection a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company s
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company related party loans. On July 28, 2023, the Company has secured
additional funding of up to from the Sponsor through the issuance of a promissory note which were amended on April 1, 2024 with
increased funding up to (see Note 5). There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination
will be successful within the Prescribed Time Frame. The unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation
of Financial Statements Going Concern, management has determined that mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination
not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the unaudited financial statements. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are
required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out
of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election
to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard
is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company,
can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the
Company s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company
which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting
standards used.

During

unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and no amounts were accrued for
interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals,
or material deviation from its position. 

The
Company may be subject to potential examination by foreign taxing authorities in the area of income taxes. These potential examinations
may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with
foreign tax laws. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change
over the next twelve months. 

The
Company is considered to be an exempted Cayman Islands company with no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently
not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. As such, the Company s
tax provision was zero for the periods presented. 

On
August 16, 2022, the U.S. Government enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act. The main provisions of
the Inflation Reduction Act (the IR Act that we anticipate may impact us is a excise tax on share repurchases. Any
redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise,
may be subject to the excise tax. Because there is possibility that the Company may acquire a U.S. domestic corporation or engage in
a transaction in which a domestic corporation becomes parent or affiliate to the Company and the Company may become a covered
corporation as a listed Company in Nasdaq. The management team has evaluated the IR Act as of September 30, 2024 and does not
believe it would have a material effect on the Company, and will continue to evaluate its impact.

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 

We
completed the IPO in May 2023. Upon the closing of the IPO and exercise of over-allotment option by underwriters as well as the sale
of the private placement units, a total of 70,337,513, including 1,725,000 of deferred underwriting commissions and after deducting
of the other underwriting commissions and expenses for the IPO, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the Trust Account maintained by Wilmington Trust National Association, acting as trustee, and will be invested only in specified U.S. government treasury
bills or in specified money market funds, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption
of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within the time period within which we must complete our initial business combination, which is up to 21
months from the closing of the IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination in accordance with our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association, which may be accomplished only if the Sponsor deposits additional funds into the
Trust Account (the Prescribed Time Frame or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights
or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within the Prescribed Time Frame, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject
to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public shareholders. 

We
will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our
initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by
means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a
tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction
and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement.
The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be 10.10 per public share (subject to increase of up to an additional 0.40
per public share in the event that the Sponsor elects to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination). The per-share
amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions
we will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect
to our rights. The Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to
waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares they may acquire during
or after our initial public offering (the IPO in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 

We
will have up to 21 months from the closing of the IPO to complete our initial business combination if we extend the period of time to
consummate a business combination, which may be accomplished only if the Sponsor deposits additional funds into the Trust Account. The
Sponsor may extend the deadline for completion of an initial business combination from February 4, 2024 up to 12 times, each by an additional
one month until February 4, 2025, subject to the Sponsor and/or its designee depositing additional funds into the Trust Account with
a monthly extension fee (the Monthly Extension Fee of 230,000 (equivalent to 0.033 per public share). On April 1, 2024,
we held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, which approved the proposal by our board of directors to amend the Monthly
Extension Fee to an amount equal to 0.02 for each outstanding public share. On July 3, 2024, we held an extraordinary general meeting
of shareholders, which approved the proposal by our board of directors to further amend the Monthly Extension Fee to an amount equal
to the lesser of (1) 50,000 for all outstanding public shares and (2) 0.02 for each outstanding public share (the Amended Monthly
Extension Fee ). The Amended Monthly Extension Fee has become operative for each month beginning on July 4, 2024. The Sponsor subsequently
caused the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth monthly extension fee of 50,000 each to be deposited into the Trust
Account for July, August, September, October and November 2024, respectively. The Sponsor intends to continue to extend
such deadline to complete an initial business combination till February 4, 2025. 

15 

If
we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the Prescribed Time Frame, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible
but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account
and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board
of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the rights will be worthless. 

Proposed
Gamehaus Business Combination 

On
September 16, 2023, we entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the Merger Agreement for a business combination
(the Proposed Gamehaus Business Combination with (i) Gamehaus Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability
in the Cayman Islands Gamehaus ), (ii) Gamehaus Holdings Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability
in the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gamehaus Pubco ), (iii) Gamehaus 1 Inc., an exempted company incorporated
with limited liability in the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco First Merger Sub (iv) Gamehaus 2
Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco Second
Merger Sub and, together with Pubco and First Merger Sub, each, individually, an Acquisition Entity and, collectively,
the Acquisition Entities and (v) G-Star Management Corporation, a British Virgin Islands company, in the capacity as,
from and after the Closing, our representative and our shareholders representative. The Merger Agreement may be terminated under
certain customary and limited circumstances prior to the consummation of the Mergers, including: (i) by mutual written consent of us
and Gamehaus; (ii) by either us or Gamehaus if any law or governmental order (other than a temporary restraining order) is in effect
that permanently restrains, enjoins, makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Mergers; (iii) by either us or Gamehaus
if any of the conditions to Closing have not been satisfied or waived by June 30, 2024 (the Termination Date (iv) by
either us or Gamehaus upon a breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement
by the other party if such breach gives rise to a failure of certain closing conditions to be satisfied and cannot or has not been cured
within the earlier of 20 days following the receipt of notice from the non-breaching party and the Termination Date; (v) by either
us or Gamehaus if our shareholder approval is not obtained at its shareholder meeting; or (vi) by us if the Gamehaus shareholder approval
is not obtained or is revoked or sought to revoke by such shareholders. See Item 1. Business Proposed Gamehaus Business
Combination in Form 10-K filed by us on March 29, 2024 for details. On June 30, 2024, we, Gamehaus, the Sponsor, and the Acquisition
Entities entered into an amendment to the Merger Agreement solely to amend Section 9.1(b) of the Merger Agreement to extend the Termination
Date from June 30, 2024 to February 4, 2025 to allow more time for the parties to meet the closing conditions, including the receipt of the requisite regulatory
approval, under the Merger Agreement. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had working capital deficit of 2,428,668 including a 7,479 of the available cash held in the
Trust Account for marketable securities, indicating a lack of liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time,
which was considered to be one year from the issuance date of the unaudited financial statements. 

We
have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant
transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a business combination. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern one year from the issuance date of the unaudited financial statements. In order to finance transaction
cost in connection a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or our officers and directors may, but are not
obligated to, provide us related party loans. On July 28, 2023, we have secured additional funding of up to 500,000 from the Sponsor
through the issuance of a promissory note which was amended on April 1, 2024 with an increased funding up to 1,000,000. There is no
assurance that our plans to consummate a business combination will be successful within the Prescribed Time Frame. The unaudited financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

In
connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial
Statements Going Concern, management has determined that mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur,
and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period
of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the unaudited financial statements. 

16 

Our
management plans to address this uncertainty through the initial business combination as discussed above. There is no assurance that
our plans to consummate the initial business combination will be successful or successful by the deadline of completing an initial business
combination as described above. The unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

We
are currently experiencing a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by
geopolitical instability and economic uncertainties. For example, United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption
following the geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent escalation of the Israel-Hamas
conflict. In response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO deployed additional
military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various
sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial
institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. Certain countries, including
the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and to Israel, increasing
geopolitical tensions among a number of nations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the escalation of the Israel Hamas conflict and the
resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European
Union, Israel and its neighboring states and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on
regional and global economies. Although the length and impact of the ongoing conflicts are highly unpredictable, they could lead to market
disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions
and increased cyber-attacks against U.S. companies. Additionally, any resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and
financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets . 

In
addition, the political and economic intense between the United States and China may also affect the business of the target of our Proposed
Gamehaus Business Combination. 

Our
search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially
adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in geopolitical tensions
and economic uncertainties. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through September
30, 2024 were organizational activities, and those necessary to prepare for the IPO, as described below and identifying a target company
for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination.
We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the IPO. We have incurred and expect
that we will continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and
auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a business combination. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 248,075 and 1,198,563, which consisted of operating costs
of 207,994 and 996,737, respectively. 

For
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 450,979 and 779,968, which consisted of operating
costs of 458,376 and 634,097, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
sold 6,900,000 units in the IPO (including the exercise in full of the over-allotment option by the underwriters in the IPO) at 10.00
per unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one right to receive two-tenths (2/10)
of an ordinary share upon the consummation of a business combination. Simultaneously with the IPO, we sold to the Sponsor 307,000 units
at 10.00 per unit in a private placement generating total gross proceeds of 3,070,000. Offering costs amounted to 3,752,890 consisting
of 1,380,000 of underwriting fees, 1,725,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and 647,890 of other offering costs. 

17 

Except
for the funds available for using as working capital, we intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account established
for the benefit of the public shareholders, including any amounts representing interest and dividends earned on the Trust Account (less
income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part,
as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital
to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was nil, which mainly consisted net income of 1,198,563,
off-setting by the increase of the prepaid expenses and investment income earned and reinvested in the Trust Account, and increase of
accrued liabilities. Net cash used in financing activities in the amount of 46,418,731 mainly consisted of the proceeds received of
Sponsor loan and redemption of shares. Net cash provided by investing activities is 46,418,731 consisted of 47,346,935 withdrawn from
Trust Account to redeem public shares, and 928,204 extension contributions which was invested into the marketable securities held in
the Trust Account. As of September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 27,831,371 of which the amount
of 7,479 can be used as available working capital not subject to redemption. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had working capital deficit of 2,428,668, including a 7,479 of the available cash
held in the Trust Account for marketable securities, indicating a lack of liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable
period of time, which was considered to be one year from the issuance date of the unaudited financial statements. 

On
July 28, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the Second Promissory Note ). Pursuant to the Second
Promissory Note, we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 500,000, which is non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation
of our initial business combination. The Second Promissory Note have no conversion feature, and no collateral. The Sponsor waives any
and all right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any distribution of or from the Trust Account, and agrees not to seek resources,
reimbursement, payment or satisfaction for any claim against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever. On April 1, 2024, we amended
and restated the Second Promissory Note solely to amend and restate the aggregate principal amount we may borrow to up to 1,000,000. 

Our
Sponsor also paid our outstanding invoices on behalf of us for operating purposes, as an additional source of liquidity. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Sponsor paid operating expenses on behalf of the Company in the amount of 850,992 and 328,821,
respectively. The payments made by the Sponsor were not considered as drawdown of the Second Promissory Note. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an
affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If
we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may
use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from the Trust Account
would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units at a price of 10.00 per unit (which,
for example, would result in the holders being issued 180,000 ordinary shares if 1,500,000 of notes were so converted (including 30,000
shares upon the closing of our initial business combination in respect of 150,000 rights included in such units) at the option of the
lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units issued to the Sponsor. The terms of such loans by our officers and
directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans
from parties other than the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds
and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in the Trust Account. 

We
believe we may have insufficient funds to meet the required expenditures of operation prior to our initial business combination. Moreover,
we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant
number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt
in connection with such business combination. we have determined that insufficient working capital, mandatory liquidation, should a business
combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance of the unaudited financial statements. 

18 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not
participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable
interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered
into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other
entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than agreements
to pay the Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative
services, provided to us. We began incurring such fees on May 1, 2023 and will continue to incur such fees monthly until the earlier
of the completion of a business combination and our liquidation. 

On
August 11, 2021, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor which was later amended on January 12, 2022 and January 4, 2023.
Pursuant to the promissory note and its amendments (the Promissory Note ), we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount
of 500,000, which is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2023 or (ii) the consummation of the IPO. We
drew down of 500,000 proceeds before February 14, 2023. On April 6, 2023, we transferred all cash balance of 181,573 in the escrow
account to the Sponsor, which deemed to be a partial repayment of the principal under the Promissory Note. On May 4, 2023, the remaining
balance was fully repaid upon the consummation of the IPO. On July 28, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor. Pursuant
to the promissory note (the Second Promissory Note ), we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 500,000, which
is non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. The Second Promissory Notes have no conversion
feature, and no collateral. The Sponsor waives any and all right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any distribution of or
from the Trust Account, and agrees not to seek resources, reimbursement, payment or satisfaction for any claim against the Trust Account
for any reason whatsoever. On April 1, 2024, we amended and restated the Second Promissory Note solely to amend and restate the aggregate
principal amount we may borrow to up to 1,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowed an aggregate amount of 928,204 under the
Amended Second Promissory Note. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company drew down 100,000 from the Amended Second Promissory Note
to pay the extension contribution of 50,000 each month for October and November 2024, respectively. The full amounts were deposited
into the Trust Account immediately. 

Pursuant
to a registration rights agreement we entered into with the Sponsor on May 1, 2023, the holders of the founder shares, private placement
units, and units that may be issued on conversion of working capital loans (and any securities underlying the private placement units
and the working capital loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior
to or on the effective date of the IPO requiring us to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities are entitled
to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back 
registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination and
rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. We will bear the expenses
incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

On
May 4, 2023, we paid a cash underwriting commission of two percent (2.0 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 1,380,000. The underwriter
is added entitled to a deferred fee of two and one-half percent (2.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 1,725,000 as the underwriter s
over-allotment option is exercised in full. The deferred fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of a business combination from the
amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting
discount of 2.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO upon the completion of our initial business combination. 

19 

On
September 16, 2023, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Gamehaus, the Sponsor, and the Acquisition Entities for a business combination.
The merger involves multiple steps and will result in the cancellation and conversion of various shares into Pubco s Class A and
Class B Ordinary Shares. After the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Closing ), we will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco. The Closing is subject to various conditions, such as shareholder approvals and regulatory
clearances (including the necessary approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission). Additionally, related agreements such
as the shareholder support agreement, founder lock-up agreement, seller lock-up Agreement, and registration rights agreements have been
executed. See Item 1. Business Proposed Gamehaus Business Combination in Form 10-K filed by us on March 29, 2024
for details. 

See
our financial statement included in this Quarterly Report for more information relating to our contractual obligation. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Critical
accounting policies 

The
preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the
periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

Offering
costs associated with the Initial Public Offering 

We
comply with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A Expenses of Offering . Offering
costs consisted of principally of professional and registration fees incurred that were directly related to the IPO. Upon completion
of the IPO, offering costs were allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the IPO based on a relative fair value basis,
compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs allocated to the rights were charged to the shareholders equity. Offering
costs allocated to the ordinary shares were charged against the carrying value of ordinary shares subject to possible redemption upon
the completion of the IPO. 

Ordinary
shares subject to possible redemption 

We
account for our ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability
instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption
rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. Our
ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain
future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside
of the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet. 

We
recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal
the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary shares
are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero. The
interest and dividends earned by the marketable security held in trust, and the extension fee invest into the marketable security held
in trust, were also recognizes in redemption value against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit immediately. The proceeds
on the deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to 50,000 of interest
to pay dissolution expenses) will be used to fund the redemption of the public shares. 

20 

Net
income (loss) per share 

We
comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. In order to determine the
net income (loss) attributable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, we first considered the undistributed income
(loss) allocable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares and the undistributed income (loss) is calculated using the
total net income (loss) less any dividends paid. We then allocated the undistributed income (loss) ratably based on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding between the redeemable and non-redeemable shares. Any remeasurement of the accretion to redemption value
of the ordinary shares subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public shareholders. 

The
calculation of diluted net income (loss) per ordinary shares and related weighted average of the ordinary shares does not consider the
effect of the rights issued in connection with the (i) Initial Public Offering, and (ii) the private placement since the exercise of
the rights are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any dilutive securities or
other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares in our earnings. As a result, diluted net income
(loss) per ordinary shares is the same as basic net income (loss) per ordinary share for the periods presented. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from
those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Our
management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting updates, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on our financial statements. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements
for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply
with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We elected to
delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards
on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

As
an emerging growth company , we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report
on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure
that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii)
comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s
report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose
certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of
the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion
of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

This
item is not applicable as we are a smaller reporting company. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, relating to ineffective
review and approval procedures over journal entries and financial statement preparation which resulted in errors not being timely identified
in prior period financial statements. For further information and details, we have fully disclosed under the Annual Report 10-K for 2023
filed on March 29, 2024. We are currently in process of improve our internal control over financial reporting, and we can offer no assurance
that our improvement will ultimately have the intended effects. 

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting 

Other
than as discussed above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against
us or any of our officers or directors in their corporate capacity. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our
material risk factors are disclosed in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on 10-K filed with the SEC
on March 29, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the aforementioned
annual report and registration statement. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time
to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

Unregistered
Sales or Repurchase of Equity Securities 

We
have not sold or repurchased any equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Use
of Proceeds 

On
May 4, 2023, we consummated the IPO consisting of 6,900,000 Public Units, including 900,000 Public Units as a result of the underwriter s
exercise in full of their over-allotment option. Each Public Unit consists of one Ordinary Share, 0.001 par value and one right to receive
two-tenths (2/10th) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination. The Public Units were sold at an
offering price of 10.00 per unit, and the IPO generated aggregate gross proceeds of 69,000,000. 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 307,000 Private Placement Units
to our Sponsor, at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of 3,070,000. 

Of
the proceeds we received from the IPO and the exercise of over-allotment option by underwriters as well as the sale of the private placement
units, a total of 70,337,513 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement transaction completed with the Sponsor, including
 1,725,000 of deferred underwriting commissions and after deducting of the other underwriting commissions and expenses for the IPO, was
deposited in the Trust Account. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the proposal to amend the Monthly Extension Fee at the extraordinary general meeting held on April
1, 2024, holders of 1,596,607 ordinary shares of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash. In connection
with the vote to approve the Amended Monthly Extension Fee at the extraordinary general meeting held on July 3, 2024, holders of 2,801,372
ordinary shares of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash. As of September 30, 2024, we had proceeds
of 7,479 that were available for working capital not subject to redemption. 

There
has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from such use as described in our prospectus filed with the SEC on May 3,
2023 pursuant to Rule 424b(4).
