Credit Agreement Debt: On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A. BMO that provided for the assignment and assumption of the previously existing loans between the Company and Bank of Montreal (the 2016 Credit Agreement and subsequent amendments into a term loan (the Term Loan and revolving credit loans (each a Revolving Loan and, collectively, the Revolving Loans, and, together with the Term Loan, the Loans ). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make the Term Loan to the Company in a principal amount not to exceed million and the Company may, from time to time prior to the maturity date, enter into Revolving Loans in amounts not to exceed, in the aggregate, million (the Revolving Credit Commitment ), subject to a Borrowing Base based on Eligible Inventory and Eligible Receivables. Subsequent amendments to the Credit Agreement reduced the Term Loan to million, extended the maturity date of the Term Loan to April 1, 2027, and require the Company to make principal installment payments on the Term Loan of million per quarter. In addition, under subsequent amendments to the Credit Agreement, BMO s Revolving Credit Commitment is currently million. The Credit Agreement also allows the Company to obtain Letters of Credit from BMO, which if drawn upon by the beneficiary thereof and paid by BMO, would become Revolving Loans. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company may not pay cash dividends on its common stock in excess of million in any fiscal year. The term of the Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement currently runs through April 1, 2027. 

Under the Credit Agreement as amended, interest rates are based on either the secured overnight financing rate SOFR or the euro interbank offered rate (the EURIBO Rate ). Loans are designated either as SOFR Loans, which accrue interest at an Adjusted Term SOFR plus an Applicable Margin, or Eurodollar Loans, which accrue interest at the EURIBO Rate plus an Applicable Margin. Amounts drawn on a Letter of Credit that are not timely reimbursed to the Bank bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Company also pays a commitment fee on the average daily Unused Revolving Credit Commitment equal to an Applicable Margin. Currently, the Applicable Margins are between and for Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit and for Term Loans and and for the Unused Revolving Credit Commitment (each depending on the Company s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio). 
 
 The Credit Agreement, as amended, requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants. Specifically, the Company s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed to 1.00, and the Company s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may not be less than to 1.00. In determining whether the Company is in compliance with its Total Funded Debt/EBITDA Ratio, the Company s EBITDA will include transaction expenses of up to million for the Katsa acquisition, as well as pro-forma EBITDA of Katsa as permitted by the Bank. The Company s Tangible Net Worth may not be less than million plus 50 of positive Net Income for each fiscal year ending on or after June 30, 2023. 
 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company s personal property, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and intellectual property. The Company has also pledged of its equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries and of its equity interests in certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company also entered into a Collateral Assignment of Rights under Purchase Agreement for its acquisition of Veth Propulsion. To effect these security interests, the Company entered into various amendment and assignment agreements that consent to the assignment of certain agreements previously entered into between the Company and the Bank of Montreal in connection with the 2016 Credit Agreement. The Company also amended and assigned to BMO a Negative Pledge Agreement that it has previously entered into with Bank of Montreal, pursuant to which it agreed not to sell, lease or otherwise encumber real estate that it owns except as permitted by the Credit Agreement and the Negative Pledge Agreement. 
 
 The Company has also entered into a Deposit Account Control Agreement with the Bank, reflecting the Bank s security interest in deposit accounts the Company maintains with the Bank. The Bank may not provide a notice of exclusive control of a deposit account (thereby obtaining exclusive control of the account) prior to the occurrence or existence of a Default or an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement or otherwise upon the occurrence or existence of an event or condition that would, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice, constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, BMO may take the following actions upon written notice to the Company: 1 terminate its remaining obligations under the Credit Agreement 2 declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and 3 demand the Company to immediately Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in an amount equal to of the aggregate L/C Obligations or a greater amount if BMO determines a greater amount is necessary. If such Event of Default is due to the Company s bankruptcy, BMO may take the three actions listed above without notice to the Company. 
 
 The Company remains in compliance with its liquidity and other covenants. 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, current maturities include of term loan payments due within the coming year.

As of September 27, 2024, the notional amount was . This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.

 The primary purpose of the Company s cash flow hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value associated with interest payments on the Company s SOFR-based indebtedness. The Company records gains and losses on interest rate swap contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent that these hedges are effective and until the Company recognizes the underlying transactions in net earnings, at which time these gains and losses are recognized in interest expense on its condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from financing activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. These contracts generally have original maturities of greater than twelve months. 
 
 Net unrealized after-tax gains related to cash flow hedging activities that were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss were and 504 as of September 27, 2024, and June 30, 2024, respectively. The unrealized amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts during each reporting period. 
 
 The Company estimates that of net unrealized losses related to cash flow hedging activities included in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. 
 
 Derivatives Designated as Net Investment Hedges 
 
 The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its investment in net assets in foreign countries. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company designated its euro denominated Revolving Loan, with a notional amount of 13,000, as a net investment hedge to mitigate the risk of variability in its euro denominated net investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. All changes in the fair value of the euro revolver were then recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those foreign investments. Net unrealized after-tax gains related to net investment hedging activities that were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss were and as of September 27, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.

Comparison of the First Quarter of Fiscal 2025 with the First Quarter of Fiscal 2024 
 
 Net sales for the first quarter increased 14.7 , or 9.3 million, to 72.9 million from 63.6 million in the same quarter a year ago. The acquisition of Katsa Oy Katsa ), completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, contributed 9.2 million of additional revenue in the quarter. This was partially offset by the sale of the boat management system product line in the prior year, reducing revenue by 1.8 million in the quarter. The remaining increase of 1.9 million reflects continued growth in demand for the company s Veth propulsion systems, along with improved revenue from the European and Australian distribution entities. The Company experienced a decline in demand for oilfield transmissions in China, negatively impacting revenue for the quarter. Global sales of marine and propulsion products improved 17.0 from the prior year, while shipments of industrial products improved by 61.3 . Shipments of off-highway transmission products declined by 7.0 , with a slow-down in the Chinese oil market. The European region saw a significant increase in revenue 7.7 million or 35.6 thanks primarily to the acquisition of Katsa. Sales into North America decreased 5.6 , or 1.0 million, on softer commercial marine shipments in the quarter. The Asia Pacific region declined 15.3 , or 3.0 million, on weaker demand for oilfield transmissions into China. Currency translation had a favorable impact on first quarter fiscal 2025 sales compared to the first quarter of the prior year totaling 0.7 million primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Sales at our manufacturing segment increased 14.8 , or 8.1 million, versus the same quarter last year. The Company s new acquisition in Finland, Katsa, contributed 9.2 million of incremental revenue. The U.S. manufacturing operations experienced a 1.8 , or 0.5 million, increase in sales versus the first fiscal quarter of 2024, with some improvement in demand for industrial products. The Company s operation in the Netherlands saw increased revenue of 0.7 million (4.5 compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2024, as this operation continues to experience record demand for its propulsion systems. The Company s Belgian operation saw a decrease compared to the prior year first quarter (7.3 or 0.4 million), with weaker demand for its marine transmission products. The Company s Italian manufacturing operation was down 2.1 million, 41.0 , compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due primarily to the sale of the boat management product line in the prior year. The Company s Swiss manufacturing operation, which supplies customized propellers for the global mega yacht and patrol boat markets, was up 0.2 million, 12.1 , compared to the prior year first quarter. 

19

Our distribution segment experienced a decrease in sales of 2.6 million, 7.8 , in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company s Asian distribution operations in Singapore, China and Japan were down 34.6 or 6.3 million from the prior year on delayed deliveries for energy related products into China. The Company s North America distribution operation saw a slight decrease 0.3 million or 6.2 on timing of supply of product from the manufacturing operations. The Company s European distribution operation saw a significant increase 2.1 million or 58.8 on a strong backlog of commercial marine projects. The Company s distribution operation in Australia and New Zealand, which provides boat accessories, propulsion and marine transmission systems for the pleasure craft market, saw an increase in revenue (22.6 increase from the prior year first fiscal quarter), primarily due to strong pleasure craft demand and a favorable currency impact. 
 
 Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 improved to 26.5 , compared to 26.2 for the same period last year. The improvement in the current year first quarter compared to the prior year result reflects the impact of additional volume partially offset by a negative mix impact. 
 
 For the fiscal 2025 first quarter, marketing, engineering and administrative ME A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 26.7 , compared to 26.6 for the fiscal 2024 first quarter. ME A expenses increased 2.6 million, 15.2 , over the same period last fiscal year. The increase in ME A spending for the quarter was comprised of the addition of Katsa 1.4 million), a stock-based compensation adjustment 0.5 million), a legal settlement 0.4 million) and a general inflationary impact 0.3 million). 
 
 Interest expense was up 0.2 million to 0.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with a higher average outstanding revolver balance following the Katsa acquisition. 
 
 Other expense of 1.3 million for the first fiscal quarter was primarily attributable to a currency loss 1.1 million) and pension amortization expense 0.2 million). 
 
 The fiscal 2025 first quarter effective tax rate was (29.2 compared to (101.9 in the prior fiscal year first quarter. The full domestic valuation allowance, along with the mix of foreign earnings by jurisdiction, resulted in the change to the effective tax rate. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Comparison between September 27, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, the Company had net working capital of 126.6 million, which represents an increase of 6.5 million, or 5.4 , from the net working capital of 120.1 million as of June 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash decreased by 3.4 million to 16.7 million as of September 27, 2024, versus 20.1 million as of June 30, 2024. As of September 27, 2024, the majority of the cash is at the Company s overseas operations in Europe 7.0 million) and Asia-Pacific 9.5 million). 
 
 Trade receivables of 51.5 million were down 0.7 million, or 1.3 , when compared to last fiscal year-end. The impact of foreign currency translation was to increase accounts receivable by 1.4 million versus June 30, 2024. As a percent of sales, trade receivables finished at 70.7 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 62.6 for the comparable period in fiscal 2024 and 61.8 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Inventories increased by 13.4 million, or 10.3 , versus June 30, 2024 to 143.9 million. The impact of foreign currency translation was to increase inventories by 4.2 million versus June 30, 2024. The largest increase came at our operation in the Netherlands 4.6 million) in support of growing backlog for the Veth product, also impacted by timing of shipment of several large projects. The Singapore distribution entity experienced a 2.3 million increase related to customer delays of deliveries on oilfield transmissions into China. Additional increases were seen at our facilities in Lufkin 1.5 million) Belgium 1.0 million) and Australia 0.9 million). The global operations team is focused on driving inventory improvements in the second fiscal quarter and beyond, with several large orders expected to ship within the quarter. On a consolidated basis, as of September 27, 2024, the Company s backlog of orders to be shipped over the next six months approximates 144.3 million, compared to 133.7 million at June 30, 2024 and 122.5 million at September 29, 2023. As a percentage of six-month backlog, inventory has increased from 98 at June 30, 2024 to 100 at September 27, 2024. 

20

Net property, plant and equipment increased 0.9 million (0.1 to 59.0 million versus 58.1 million at June 30, 2024. The Company had capital spending of 2.2 million in the quarter, and a favorable exchange impact of 0.8 million. These increases were offset by depreciation of 1.9 million. Capital spending occurring in the first quarter was primarily related to replacement capital, along with capital to drive growth and operating efficiencies. In total, the Company expects to invest between 13 and 15 million in capital assets in fiscal 2025. The Company continues to review its capital plans based on overall market conditions and availability of capital, and may make changes to its capital plans accordingly. The Company s capital program is focused on modernizing key core manufacturing, assembly and testing processes and improving efficiencies at its facilities around the world. 
 
 Accounts payable as of September 27, 2024 of 31.1 million was down 1.5 million, or 4.5 , from June 30, 2024. The impact of foreign currency translation was to increase accounts payable by 1.0 million versus June 30, 2024. The remaining decrease is primarily related to the timing of inventory receipts within the quarter. 
 
 Total borrowings and long-term debt as of September 27, 2024 increased 4.0 million to 29.8 million versus 25.8 million at June 30, 2024. During the first quarter, the Company reported negative free cash flow of 6.7 million (defined as operating cash flow less acquisitions of fixed assets), driven by unfavorable working capital movement related primarily to inventory, the payment of the annual bonus for fiscal 2024 and capital spending. The Company ended the quarter with total debt, net of cash, of 13.1 million, compared to 5.7 million at June 30, 2024, for a net degradation of 7.4 million. 
 
 Total equity increased 2.7 million, or 1.8 , to 157.4 million as of September 27, 2024. The net loss during the first quarter decreased equity by 2.9 million, offset by a favorable foreign currency translation of 7.0 million. The net change in common stock and treasury stock resulting from the accounting for stock-based compensation decreased equity by 1.9 million. The net remaining decrease in equity of 0.7 million primarily represents the amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service cost on the Company s defined benefit pension plans, along with the unrealized loss on cash flow hedges. 
 
 On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A. BMO that provided for the assignment and assumption of the previously existing loans between the Company and Bank of Montreal (the 2016 Credit Agreement and subsequent amendments into a term loan (the Term Loan and revolving credit loans (each a Revolving Loan and, collectively, the Revolving Loans, and, together with the Term Loan, the Loans ). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make the Term Loan to the Company in a principal amount not to exceed 35.0 million and the Company may, from time to time prior to the maturity date, enter into Revolving Loans in amounts not to exceed, in the aggregate, 50.0 million (the Revolving Credit Commitment ), subject to a Borrowing Base based on Eligible Inventory and Eligible Receivables. Subsequent amendments to the Credit Agreement reduced the Term Loan to 20.0 million, extended the maturity date of the Term Loan to April 1, 2027, and require the Company to make principal installment payments on the Term Loan of 0.5 million per quarter. In addition, under subsequent amendments to the Credit Agreement, BMO s Revolving Credit Commitment is currently 45.0 million. The Credit Agreement also allows the Company to obtain Letters of Credit from BMO, which if drawn upon by the beneficiary thereof and paid by BMO, would become Revolving Loans. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company may not pay cash dividends on its common stock in excess of 5.0 million in any fiscal year. The term of the Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement currently runs through April 1, 2027. 
 
 Under the Credit Agreement as amended, interest rates are based on either the secured overnight financing rate SOFR or the euro interbank offered rate (the EURIBO Rate ). Loans are designated either as SOFR Loans, which accrue interest at an Adjusted Term SOFR plus an Applicable Margin, or Eurodollar Loans, which accrue interest at the EURIBO Rate plus an Applicable Margin. Amounts drawn on a Letter of Credit that are not timely reimbursed to the Bank bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Company also pays a commitment fee on the average daily Unused Revolving Credit Commitment equal to an Applicable Margin. Currently, the Applicable Margins are between 2.00 and 3.50 for Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit; 2.125 and 3.625 for Term Loans; and 0.15 and 0.30 for the Unused Revolving Credit Commitment (each depending on the Company s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio). 
 
 The Credit Agreement, as amended, requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants. Specifically, the Company s Total Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed 3.50 to 1.00, and the Company s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may not be less than 1.10 to 1.00. In determining whether the Company is in compliance with its Total Funded Debt/EBITDA Ratio, the Company s EBITDA will include transaction expenses of up to 0.6 million for the Katsa acquisition, as well as pro-forma EBITDA of Katsa as permitted by the Bank. The Company s Tangible Net Worth may not be less than 100.0 million plus 50 of positive Net Income for each fiscal year ending on or after June 30, 2023. 

21

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company s personal property, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and intellectual property. The Company has also pledged 100 of its equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries and 65 of its equity interests in certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company also entered into a Collateral Assignment of Rights under Purchase Agreement for its acquisition of Veth Propulsion. To effect these security interests, the Company entered into various amendment and assignment agreements that consent to the assignment of certain agreements previously entered into between the Company and the Bank of Montreal in connection with the 2016 Credit Agreement. The Company also amended and assigned to BMO a Negative Pledge Agreement that it has previously entered into with Bank of Montreal, pursuant to which it agreed not to sell, lease or otherwise encumber real estate that it owns except as permitted by the Credit Agreement and the Negative Pledge Agreement. 
 
 The Company has also entered into a Deposit Account Control Agreement with the Bank, reflecting the Bank s security interest in deposit accounts the Company maintains with the Bank. The Bank may not provide a notice of exclusive control of a deposit account (thereby obtaining exclusive control of the account) prior to the occurrence or existence of a Default or an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement or otherwise upon the occurrence or existence of an event or condition that would, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice, constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, BMO may take the following actions upon written notice to the Company: (1) terminate its remaining obligations under the Credit Agreement; (2) declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable; and (3) demand the Company to immediately Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in an amount equal to 105 of the aggregate L/C Obligations or a greater amount if BMO determines a greater amount is necessary. If such Event of Default is due to the Company s bankruptcy, BMO may take the three actions listed above without notice to the Company. 
 
 The Company remains in compliance with its liquidity and other covenants. 
 
 Management believes that available cash, the Credit Agreement, the unsecured lines of credit, cash generated from future operations, and potential access to debt markets will be adequate to fund the Company's cash and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Other significant contractual obligations as of September 27, 2024 are disclosed in Note N "Lease Liabilities" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There are no material undisclosed guarantees. As of September 27, 2024, the Company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant, and equipment, which generally have terms of less than 90 days. The Company has long-term obligations related to its postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in Note G "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Postretirement medical claims are paid by the Company as they are submitted. In fiscal 2025, the Company expects to contribute 0.5 million to postretirement benefits based on actuarial estimates; however, these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the Company is self-insured.
