At December 31, 2023, debt securities had unrealized losses with aggregate depreciation of approximately from the Company s amortized cost basis. These unrealized losses have not been recognized into income because management does not intend to sell these securities, and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Furthermore, the unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions and were not reflective of credit events. To make this determination, consideration is given to such factors as the credit rating of the issuer, level of credit enhancement, changes in credit ratings, market conditions such as current interest rates, any adverse conditions specific to the security, and delinquency status on contractual payments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was allowance for credit losses carried on the Company s securities portfolio. Accrued interest receivable on securities, which is recorded within accrued interest on the balance sheet, totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The Company has entered into a fair value hedging transaction to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on the fair value of U.S. treasury securities. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for disclosure of the gains and losses recognized on derivative instruments and the cumulative fair value hedging adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged securities.

The Company analyzes all loans individually to assign a risk rating, grouped into five major categories defined as follows: Pass: A pass loan is a credit with no known or existing potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention. Watch: Loans classified as watch have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, this potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company s credit position at some future date. Watch loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. Well defined weaknesses include a borrower s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time, or the failure to fulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were and shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock reserved for future grants under the 2023 EIP. Stock Options The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatilities are based on an industry index as described below. The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account the fact that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Historically, the Company has not paid a dividend on its common stock and does not expect to do so in the near fut ure The Co mpany used the S P 600 CM Bank Index as its historical volatility index. The S P 600 CM Bank Index is an index of publicly traded small capitalization, regional, commercial banks located throughout the United States.

 Mortgage-Backed Securities Corporate Securities SBA Securities Asset-Backed Securities Interest Rate Caps Interest Rate Swaps Total Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities: Interest Rate Swaps Total Fair Value of Financial Liabilities Investment Securities When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment securities; such items are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. For the Company s investments, when quoted prices are not available for identical securities in an active market, the Company determines fair value utilizing vendors who apply matrix pricing for similar bonds where no price is observable or may compile prices from various sources. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, current market, and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially, all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Fair values from these models are verified, where possible, against quoted market prices for recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the security being valued. Such methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, when prices from independent sources vary, or cannot be obtained or corroborated, a security is generally classified as Level 3. Interest Rate Caps The fair value of the caps is calculated by determining the total expected asset or liability exposure of the derivatives. Total expected exposure incorporates both the current and potential future exposure of the derivative, derived from using observable inputs, such as yield curves and volatilities, and accordingly are valued using Level 2 inputs. Interest Rate Swaps Interest rate swaps are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. For those interest rate swaps, fair value is determined using internally developed models of a third party that uses primarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities, and accordingly are valued using Level 2 inputs. Nonrecurring Basis Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment or a change in the amount of previously recognized impairment.

 Totals 

December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loss Individually Evaluated Loans Totals Individually Evaluated Loans The Company records certain loans at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Individually evaluated loans for which an allowance is established, or a write-down has occurred during the period, based on the fair value of collateral require classification in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the loan s collateral is determined by appraisals, independent valuation and other techniques. When the fair value of the loan s collateral is based on an observable market price the Company classifies the fair value of the individually evaluated loans within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. For loans in which the valuation has unobservable inputs, the Company classifies these within the Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, collateral values were estimated using a combination of observable inputs, including recent appraisals, and unobservable inputs, including internally determined values based on cost adjusted for depreciation and customized discounting criteria on appraisals which ranged from - . Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, fair values of individually evaluated loans have been classified as Level 3. Fair Value Disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate that value, is required whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value of cash flow or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Certain financial instruments with a fair value that is not practicable to estimate and all non-financial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not necessarily represent the underlying value of the Company. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters that could affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on existing on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business. Deposits with no stated maturities are defined as having a fair value equivalent to the amount payable on demand. This prohibits adjusting fair value derived from retaining those deposits for an expected future period of time. This component, commonly referred to as a deposit base intangible, is neither considered in the above amounts nor is it recorded as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as a part of the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since December 31, 2023. Certain policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect the reported results and financial position for the current period or in future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded or adjusted to reflect fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the future financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed each critical accounting policy and the methodology for the identification and determination of critical accounting policies with the Company s Audit Committee. Recent Developments On August 28, 2024, the Company and FMB jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Bridgewater Bank will acquire First Minnetonka City Bank, the wholly-owned banking subsidiary of FMB, in an all-cash transaction. On October 23, 2024, the Company announced the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals for the transaction. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to the satisfaction of remaining closing conditions. At the closing of the transaction, First Minnetonka City Bank will merge with and into Bridgewater Bank, with Bridgewater Bank as the surviving entity. The combined organization is expected to have approximately 4.9 billion in total assets, 4.0 billion in deposits, 3.9 billion in loans and leases, and nine full-service branches across the Twin Cities.

 Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations Net Income Net income was 8.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of 9.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Earnings per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2024 were 0.27, compared to 0.30 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2023. Net income was 24.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 31.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.77, compared to 0.99 per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net Interest Income The Company s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is impacted by the level of interest earning assets and related funding sources, as well as changes in interest rates. The difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. Noninterest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders equity, also support earning assets. The impact of the noninterest bearing sources of funds is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. Both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to pretax-equivalent income, assuming a 21 federal tax rate. Management s ability to respond to changes in interest rates by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to managing net interest margin and the Company s primary source of earnings.

Table of Contents 
 Interest Rates and Operating Interest Differential Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table presents the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period s average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous period s volume. The changes not attributable specifically to either volume or rate have been allocated to the changes due to volume. The following tables present the changes in the volume and rate of interest bearing assets and liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 :

The increase in net interest income was primarily due to increased cash balances, growth and higher yields in the securities portfolio, and higher yields on loans, offset partially by growth and higher rates on deposits. Net interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.24 , an eight basis point decline from 2.32 in the third quarter of 2023. Core net interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis), a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of loan fees, was 2.16 for the third quarter of 2024, an eight basis point decline from 2.24 in the third quarter of 2023. The decline in the margin was primarily due to higher funding costs, offset partially by higher earning asset yields. Average interest earning assets were 4.60 billion for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 179.1 million, or 4.1 , compared to 4.42 billion for the third quarter of 2023. This increase in average interest earning assets was primarily due to increased cash balances and purchases of investment securities. Average interest bearing liabilities were 3.49 billion for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 226.6 million, or 6.9 , compared to 3.26 billion for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in all deposit types and FHLB advances, offset partially by a decrease in federal funds purchased. Average interest earning assets produced a tax-equivalent yield of 5.48 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 5.14 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to the purchase of higher yielding securities and the repricing of the loan and securities portfolios in the higher interest rate environment. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 4.27 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 3.81 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to continued deposit repricing in the higher rate environment. Interest Income. Total interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 63.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 57.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 6.1 million, or 10.7 , increase in total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was primarily due to purchases of investment securities and higher earning asset yields in the higher interest rate environment. Interest income on the investment securities portfolio, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased 2.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a 105.0 million, or 17.6 , increase in average balances between the two periods and higher rates earned on securities. Interest income on loans, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 52.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 49.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 2.8 million increase was primarily due to the repricing of the loan portfolio in the higher interest rate environment. Loan interest income and loan fees remained one of the primary contributing factors to the changes in the yield on interest earning assets. The aggregate loan yield increased to 5.57 in the third quarter of 2024, which was 31 basis points higher than 5.26 in the third quarter of 2023. The core loan yield continued to rise as new loans originated at higher yields and the existing portfolio reprice in the higher rate environment. The following table presents a summary of interest and fees recognized on loans for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Interest 5.47 5.42 5.31 5.25 5.16 Fees 0.10 0.08 0.07 0.08 0.10 Yield on Loans 5.57 5.50 5.38 5.33 5.26 Interest Expense. Interest expense on interest bearing liabilities was 37.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 6.0 million, from 31.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth and upward repricing of the deposit portfolio in the higher interest rate environment. Interest expense on deposits was 34.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 7.0 million, from 27.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to upward repricing of the deposit portfolio in the higher interest rate environment and the average balance of interest bearing deposits increasing by 231.8 million, or 8.1 . The cost of total deposits was 3.58 in the third quarter of 2024, a 59 basis point increase, compared to 2.99 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the upward repricing of the deposit portfolio in the higher interest rate environment. Interest expense on borrowings was 3.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 921,000, compared to 4.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decreased utilization of federal funds purchased and a decrease in the rate on FHLB advances. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net interest income was 75.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 4.6 million, or 5.8 , compared to 79.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to growth and higher rates paid on deposits, offset partially by growth and higher earning asset yields in the higher interest rate environment. Net interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.24 , a 23 basis point decline from 2.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Core net interest margin (on a fully

 tax-equivalent basis), a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of loan fees, was 2.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 22 basis point decline from 2.39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average interest earning assets were 4.54 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 166.2 million, or 3.8 , compared to 4.38 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in average interest earning assets was primarily due to organic growth in the loan portfolio, continued purchases of investment securities, and an increase in cash balances. Average interest bearing liabilities were 3.44 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 225.8 million, or 7.0 , compared to 3.22 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in interest bearing transaction deposits, time deposits, brokered deposits, and FHLB advances, offset partially by a decrease in federal funds purchased. Average interest earning assets produced a tax-equivalent yield of 5.39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 4.16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Income. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was 183.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 165.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 18.5 million increase in total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was primarily due to an increase in cash balances, organic growth in the loan portfolio, purchases of investment securities and higher earning asset yields in the higher interest rate environment. Interest income on the investment securities portfolio, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased 5.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 83.1 million, or 13.9 , increase in average balances and a 63 basis point increase in yield between the periods. Interest income on loans, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 153.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 142.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 10.9 million increase was primarily due to a 1.4 increase in the average balances of loans outstanding and a 31 basis point increase in yield. Interest Expense. Interest expense on interest bearing liabilities was 107.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 23.4 million, compared to 83.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth and continued deposit repricing in the higher interest rate environment, offset partially by decreased utilization of federal funds purchased. Interest expense on deposits increased to 96.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 29.4 million increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to upward repricing of the deposit portfolio in the higher interest rate environment. Interest expense on borrowings was 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower average balances of federal funds purchased. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses on loans was -0- for both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses on loans was 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Although loans decreased during the quarter, increased loss rates and other qualitative factor adjustments resulted in no provision for the quarter. The allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 1.38 at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.36 at December 31, 2023.

No provision was recorded during the third quarter of 2024 due to unfunded commitments remaining stable as the migration to funded loans was offset by the volume of newly originated loans with unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet exposures was a negative provision of 100,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a negative provision of 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The negative provision for both periods was due to a reduction in outstanding unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was 2.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.0 million as of December 31, 2023.

The decrease was primarily due to 493,000 of FHLB prepayment income recognized in the previous year which did not reoccur, offset partially by higher letter of credit fees, an increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance and an increase in other income. Noninterest income was 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 249,000 from 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower letter of credit fees and 792,000 of FHLB prepayment income recognized in the previous year which did not reoccur, offset partially by an increase in net gain on sale of securities and an increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance.

The increase was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits, higher professional and consulting fees relating to the acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank, increases in information technology and telecommunications, and marketing and advertising expense, offset partially by a decrease in the FDIC insurance assessment and lower derivative collateral fees. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Noninterest expense was 46.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.9 million, from 43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits and higher professional and consulting fees driven by the acquisition of First Minnetonka City Bank. The Company had 265 full-time equivalent employees at the end of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 255 at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Efficiency Ratio. The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, reports total noninterest expense, less amortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of net interest income plus total noninterest income, less gains (losses) on sales of securities. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides a meaningful comparison of operational performance and facilitates investors assessments of business performance and trends in comparison to peers in the banking industry. The efficiency ratio was 58.0 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 56.1 for the third quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 58.3 and 51.2 , respectively. The efficiencies of the Company s branch-light model have positioned the Company well to continue navigating a challenging environment for a more spread-based revenue model.

Fluctuations in effective tax rates reflect the differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income and expenses for income tax purposes and the recognition of tax credits. The Company s future effective income tax rate will fluctuate based on the mix of taxable and tax-free investments and loans, the recognition and availability of tax credit investments, and overall taxable income. Income tax expense was 2.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The effective combined federal and state income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.6 , compared to 23.0 for the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense was 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective combined federal and state income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 23.6 and 24.7 , respectively. The fluctuations in the effective tax rate across both periods was primarily due to the timing and delivery of tax credits. Financial Condition Assets Total assets at September 30, 2024 were 4.69 billion, an increase of 79.5 million, or 1.7 , over total assets of 4.61 billion at December 31, 2023, and an increase of 134.4 million, or 3.0 , over total assets of 4.56 billion at September 30, 2023. The year-to-date and year-over-year growth were primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and purchases of investment securities. Investment Securities Portfolio The investment securities portfolio is used to make various term investments and is intended to provide the Company with adequate liquidity, a source of stable income, and at times, serve as collateral for certain types of deposits or borrowings. Investment balances in the investment securities portfolio are subject to change over time based on funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. The liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to ensure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs. The investment securities portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities, municipal securities, and corporate securities comprised primarily of subordinated debentures of banks and financial holding companies. In addition, the Company also holds U.S. treasury securities, other mortgage backed and other debt

 securities. The investment securities portfolio has varying contractual maturities, some of these maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as the securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities. All investment securities are held as available for sale. Securities available for sale were 664.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 604.1 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 60.6 million, or 10.0 . At September 30, 2024, U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities represented 15.5 of the portfolio, municipal securities represented 16.8 of the portfolio, corporate securities represented 20.8 of the portfolio, U.S. treasury securities represented 15.9 of the portfolio, SBA securities represented 2.2 of the portfolio, other mortgage-backed securities represented 16.1 of the portfolio, and asset-backed securities represented 12.7 of the portfolio. The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale, by type, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

The Company lends primarily to commercial customers, consisting of loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties, multifamily residential properties, land, and non-real estate business assets. Responsive service, local decision making, and an efficient turnaround time from application to closing have been significant factors in growing the loan portfolio. The Company manages concentrations of credit exposure through a risk management program which implements formalized processes and procedures specifically for managing and mitigating risk within the loan portfolio. The processes and procedures include board and management oversight, commercial real estate exposure limits, portfolio monitoring tools, management information systems, market reports, underwriting standards, internal and external loan review, and stress testing. Total gross loans at September 30, 2024 were 3.69 billion, a decrease of 38.7 million, or 1.0 , over total gross loans of 3.72 billion at December 31, 2023, and a decrease of 36.7 million, or 1.0 , over total gross loans of 3.72 billion at September 30, 2023. T he decrease in the loan portfolio during both periods was primarily due to elevated loan payoffs, offset partially by loan originations. The pace of loan growth has moderated in recent quarters, when compared to historical levels, due to active balance sheet management to continue to align loan growth with the funding outlook and ultimately the impact of the higher interest rate environment on the number of prospective deals that meet underwriting standards.

The composition of the portfolio has remained relatively consistent with prior periods and the Company does not expect any significant changes in the composition of the loan portfolio or the emphasis on real estate lending in the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, investor CRE loans totaled 2.58 billion, consisting of 1.03 billion of loans secured by nonowner occupied CRE, 1.38 billion of loans secured by multifamily residential properties, 45.8 million of 1-4 family construction loans and 118.6 million of construction and land development loans. Investor CRE loans represented 69.9 of the total gross loan portfolio and 449.1 of the Bank s total risk-based capital at September 30, 2024, compared to 71.8 and 482.4 , respectively, at December 31, 2023.

Federal regulations and internal policies require the use of an asset classification system as a means of managing and reporting problem and potential problem assets. The Company has incorporated an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent with federal banking regulations, as a part of the credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the financial institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly 

 55 

Table of Contents 
 questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated watch. The following table presents information on loan classifications at September 30, 2024. The Company had no assets classified as doubtful or loss at September 30, 2024.

Loans that warranted a substandard risk rating at September 30, 2024 totaled 31.6 million, compared to 35.9 million at December 31, 2023. Management continues to actively work with these borrowers and closely monitor substandard credits. Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming loans include loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and loans 90 days past due and still accruing. Nonaccrual loans totaled 8.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and 919,000 as of December 31, 2023. There were no loans 90 days past due and still accruing as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there were 434,000 of foreclosed assets. There were no foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2023. The overall increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to one central business district office loan, which previously had a substandard risk rating. The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets, by category, at the dates indicated: 

September 30, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Total Nonaccrual Loans 8,378 919 Total Nonperforming Loans 8,378 919 Plus: Foreclosed Assets 434 Total Nonperforming Assets (1) 8,812 919 Nonaccrual Loans to Total Loans 0.23 0.02 Nonperforming Loans to Total Loans 0.23 0.02 Nonperforming Assets to Total Loans Plus Foreclosed Assets (1) 0.24 0.02 

 (1) Nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans and loans greater than 90 days past due still accruing plus foreclosed assets. There were no loans greater than 90 days past due still accruing for any period shown. The balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. The Company has established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on a loan (that is, to place the loan on nonaccrual status) after it has become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loan is considered to be well-collateralized and is actively in the process of collection. In addition, a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of interest is expected. Interest previously accrued but

 uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against current income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. If management believes that a loan will not be collected in full, an increase to the allowance for credit losses on loans is recorded to reflect management s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied directly to principal. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the gross income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans was 116,000 and 152,000, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, gross income that would have been recorded on nonacrrual loans was 20,000 and 51,000, respectively. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses on loans is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level management considers adequate to provide for expected lifetime losses in the portfolio. Although management strives to maintain an allowance it deems adequate, future economic changes, deterioration of borrowers creditworthiness, and the impact of examinations by regulatory agencies, among other factors, all could cause changes to the allowance for credit losses on loans. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans was 51.0 million, an increase of 524,000 from 50.5 million at December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs totaled 931,000 during the third quarter of 2024 and 116,000 during the third quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs totaled 926,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 111,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans was 1.38 at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.36 at December 31, 2023. The following table presents a summary of net charge-offs for the periods indicated:

Core deposits, defined as total deposits excluding brokered deposits and time deposits greater than 250,000, increased 131.2 million, or 6.9 annualized, from December 31, 2023. Growth in core deposits was primarily due to increased balances of existing clients and new client acquisitions. Based on the nature of the Company s client base, management believes core deposits could fluctuate in future periods as deposit growth is not always linear. The Company relies on increasing the deposit base to fund loans and other asset growth. The Company is in a highly competitive market and competes for local deposits by offering attractive products with competitive rates. The Company expects to have a higher average cost of funds for local deposits compared to competitor banks due to the lack of an extensive branch network. The Company s strategy is to offset the higher cost of funding with a lower level of operating expense. When appropriate, the Company utilizes alternative funding sources such as brokered deposits. The brokered deposit market provides flexibility in structure, optionality and efficiency not afforded in traditional retail deposit channels. As of September 30, 2024, total brokered deposits were 901.0 million, a decrease of 123.5 million, compared to total brokered deposits of 1.02 billion at December 31, 2023. Brokered deposits continue to be used as a supplemental funding source, as needed, to support loan portfolio growth.

The Company had additional borrowing capacity under this credit facility of 509.2 million and 498.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has an outstanding Loan and Security Agreement and revolving note with a third party correspondent lender, which is secured by 100 of the issued and outstanding stock of the Bank. On September 1, 2024, the Company entered into a third amendment to the agreement which extended the maturity date of the Company s existing revolving line of credit with a maximum principal amount of 40.0 million from September 1, 2024 to September 1, 2026. The amendment also increased the floor rate from 3.85 to 4.50 . As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 13.8 million of outstanding balances under the revolving line of credit. Additionally, the Company has borrowing capacity from other sources. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was eligible to use the Federal Reserve discount window for borrowings. Based on assets pledged as collateral as of the applicable date, the Bank s borrowing availability was approximately 868.0 million and 979.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding advances from the discount window.

The Company expects to maintain adequate cash levels through earnings, loan and securities repayments and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. As described above, the Company has in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Capital Total shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 452.2 million, an increase of 26.7 million, or 6.3 , compared to total shareholders equity of 425.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to net income retained and a decrease in unrealized losses in the securities portfolio, offset partially by a decrease in unrealized gains in the derivatives portfolio, preferred stock dividends, and stock repurchases. Tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 13.96 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 8.8 from 12.84 as of December 31, 2023. Tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 8.17 at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.73 at December 31, 2023. Stock Repurchase Program . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased no shares of its common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 446,509 shares of its common stock, representing 1.6 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares at that time. Shares were repurchased during this period at a weighted average price of 11.60 per share, for a total of 5.2 million. All shares repurchased under the stock repurchase program were converted to authorized but unissued shares. On July 23, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the Company s previously announced stock repurchase program (the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program from August 16, 2024 to August 20, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount that could be used to repurchase shares under the stock repurchase program was 15.3 million . The Company remains committed to maintaining strong capital levels while enhancing shareholder value as it strategically executes its stock repurchase program based on various factors including valuation, capital levels and other uses of capital. Regulatory Capital. The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s and Bank s business.

A banking organization with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, stock repurchases and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At September 30, 2024, the ratios for the Company and the Bank were sufficient to meet the conservation buffer. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions to meet the financing needs of clients, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in the consolidated balance sheets. These transactions include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and the standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon. All off-balance sheet commitments are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold.

 The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company decreases its exposure to losses under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. The Company assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establishes a liability for probable credit losses. The following table presents credit arrangements and financial instruments whose contract amounts represented credit risk as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fixed Variable Fixed Variable (dollars in thousands) Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit 162,664 361,034 164,880 381,752 Letters of Credit 5,745 106,324 6,780 96,509 Totals 168,409 467,358 171,660 478,261 The Company had outstanding letters of credit with the FHLB of 133.9 million and 114.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, on behalf of customers and to secure public deposits. Liquidity Liquidity is the Company s capacity to meet cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the Company s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting either daily operations or financial condition. The Bank s Asset Liability Management, or ALM, Committee, which is comprised of members of senior management, is responsible for managing commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving the Company s financial objectives. The ALM Committee meets regularly to review balance sheet composition, funding capacities, and current and forecasted loan demand. The Company manages liquidity by maintaining adequate levels of cash and other assets from on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. Specifically, on-balance sheet liquidity consists of cash and due from banks and unpledged investment securities available for sale, which are referred to as primary liquidity. In regards to off-balance sheet capacity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and a correspondent lender, as well as unsecured lines of credit for the purpose of overnight funds with various correspondent banks, which the Company refers to as secondary liquidity. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company elected not to renew its membership and discontinued its use of the American Financial Exchange, or AFX. This had no impact on liquidity ratios as the availability of funds changed daily and therefore was not previously included in secondary liquidity. The Company had no borrowings outstanding through the AFX as of December 31, 2023. Total on- and off-balance sheet liquidity was 2.29 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2.23 billion at December 31, 2023. The Company did not utilize the Federal Reserve Discount Window during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Secondary liquidity decreased by 101.0 million as of September 30, 2024, when compared to December 31, 2023, due to a 111.5 million decrease in the borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank, offset partially by a 10.5 million increase in the borrowing capacity with the FHLB. In addition to primary liquidity, the Company generates liquidity from cash flows from the loan and securities portfolios and from the large base of core deposits, defined as noninterest bearing transaction, interest bearing transaction, savings, non-brokered money market accounts and non-brokered time deposits less than 250,000. At September 30, 2024, core deposits totaled approximately 2.68 billion and represented 71.5 of total deposits. These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company, which promote long-standing relationships and stable funding sources. The Company uses brokered deposits, the availability of which is uncertain and subject to competitive market forces and regulation, for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes. At September 30, 2024, brokered deposits totaled 901.0 million, consisting of 761.5 million of brokered time deposits and 139.5 million of non-maturity brokered money market and transaction accounts. At December 31, 2023, brokered deposits totaled 1.02 billion, consisting of 850.5 million of brokered time deposits and 174.0 million of non-maturity brokered money market and transaction accounts. The Company s liquidity policy includes guidelines for On-Balance Sheet Liquidity (a measurement of primary liquidity to total deposits plus borrowings), Total On-Balance Sheet Liquidity with Borrowing Capacity (a measurement of primary and secondary liquidity to total deposits plus borrowings), Wholesale Funding Ratio (a measurement of total wholesale funding to total deposits plus borrowings), and other guidelines developed for measuring and maintaining liquidity.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk As a financial institution, the Company s primary market risk is interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of loss of net interest income or net interest margin because of changes in interest rates. The Company continually seeks to measure and manage the potential impact of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk occurs when interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities mature or re-price at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rate risk also arises when assets and liabilities each respond differently to changes in interest rates. The Company s management of interest rate risk is overseen by its ALM Committee, based on a risk management infrastructure approved by the board of directors that outlines reporting and measurement requirements. In particular, this infrastructure sets limits and management targets for various metrics, including net interest income simulation involving parallel shifts in interest rate curves, steepening and flattening yield curves, and various prepayment and deposit duration assumptions. The Company s risk management infrastructure also requires a periodic review of all key assumptions used, such as identifying appropriate interest rate scenarios, setting loan prepayment rates

 based on historical analysis and noninterest bearing and interest bearing transaction deposit durations based on historical analysis. The Company does not engage in speculative trading activities relating to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, equities or credit. The Company manages the interest rate risk associated with interest earning assets by managing the interest rates and terms associated with the investment securities portfolio by purchasing and selling investment securities from time to time. The Company manages the interest rate risk associated with interest bearing liabilities by managing the interest rates and terms associated with wholesale borrowings and deposits from customers which the Company relies on for funding. For example, the Company occasionally uses special offers on deposits to alter the interest rates and terms associated with interest bearing liabilities. The Company has entered into certain hedging transactions including interest rate swaps and caps, which are designed to lessen elements of the Company s interest rate exposure. Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. The Company utilizes cash flow hedges to manage interest rate exposure for the brokered deposit and wholesale borrowing portfolios. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these cash flow hedges had a total notional amount of 308.0 million. Fair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or value. The Company utilizes fair value hedges to manage fair value exposure for the U.S. treasury security portfolio. At September 30, 2024, these fair value hedges had a total notional amount of 97.7 million. There were no fair value hedges at December 31, 2023. In the event that interest rates do not change in the manner anticipated, such transactions may adversely affect the Company s results of operations. Net Interest Income Simulation The Company uses a net interest income simulation model to measure and evaluate potential changes in net interest income that would result over the next 12 months from immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as of the measurement date. This model has inherent limitations and the results are based on a given set of rate changes and assumptions as of a certain point in time. For purposes of the simulation, the Company assumes no growth in either interest-sensitive assets or liabilities over the next 12 months; therefore, the model s results reflect an interest rate shock to a static balance sheet. The simulation model also incorporates various other assumptions, which the Company believes are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results, such as: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2) shifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) re-pricing characteristics for market-rate-sensitive instruments, (4) differing sensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying rate indices, (5) varying loan prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios, (6) the effect of interest rate limitations in assets, such as floors and caps, and (7) overall growth and repayment rates and product mix of assets and liabilities. Because of the limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on the results, but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset-liability management strategies and to manage interest rate risk. Potential changes to the Company s net interest income in hypothetical rising and declining rate scenarios calculated as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in the table below. The projections assume an immediate, parallel shift downward of the yield curve of 100, 200, and 300 basis points and immediate, parallel shifts

Table of Contents 
 upward of the yield curve of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points. In the current interest rate environment, a downward shift of the yield curve of 400 basis points does not provide us with meaningful results and thus is not presented. 

(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change (basis points) Forecasted Percentage Forecasted Percentage in Interest Rates Net Interest Change Net Interest Change (12-Month Projection) Income from Base Income from Base +400 109,509 (6.58) 118,597 (2.39) +300 110,994 (5.31) 118,983 (2.08) +200 112,118 (4.35) 119,395 (1.74) +100 114,416 (2.39) 119,916 (1.31) 0 117,218 121,504 100 120,865 3.11 125,138 2.99 200 124,853 6.51 128,643 5.87 300 130,226 11.10 132,269 8.86 The table above indicates that as of September 30, 2024, in the event of an immediate and sustained 400 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 6.58 decrease in net interest income. In the event of an immediate 300 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Company would experience an 11.10 increase in net interest income. The results of this simulation analysis are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted. For example, if the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes differ from those projected, net interest income might vary significantly. Non-parallel yield curve shifts such as a flattening or steepening of the yield curve or changes in interest rate spreads would also cause net interest income to be different from that depicted. An increasing interest rate environment could reduce projected net interest income if deposits and other short-term liabilities re-price faster than expected or re-price faster than the Company s assets. Actual results could differ from those projected if the Company grows assets and liabilities faster or slower than estimated, if the Company experienced a net outflow of deposit liabilities, or if the mix of assets and liabilities otherwise changes. Actual results could also differ from those projected if the Company experienced substantially different repayment speeds in the loan portfolio than those assumed in the simulation model. Finally, these simulation results do not contemplate all the actions that the Company may undertake in response to potential or actual changes in interest rates, such as changes to the Company s loan, investment, deposit, or funding strategies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party, and no property of these entities is subject, to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Bank s business. The Company does not know of any proceeding contemplated by a governmental authority against the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Item 1.A. Risk Factors Other than disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. Transaction-Related Risks The Company May Fail to Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Proposed Merger with First Minnetonka City Bank. Bridgewater Bank and First Minnetonka City Bank have operated and, until the consummation of the proposed merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend on, among other things, the Company s ability to combine the businesses of Bridgewater Bank and First Minnetonka City Bank in a manner that permits growth opportunities, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies, and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of Bridgewater Bank and First Minnetonka City Bank nor result in decreased revenues due to any loss of customers. If the Company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation s business, financial condition, operating results, prospects and stock price. While individuals employed by First Minnetonka City Bank immediately prior to the effective time will automatically become employees of Bridgewater Bank following the merger, certain employees may not be retained by Bridgewater Bank after the merger. In addition, certain employees that the Company wishes to retain may elect to terminate their employment as a result of the merger, which could delay or disrupt the integration process. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of the Company s or FMB s ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of Bridgewater Bank and First Minnetonka City Bank to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. Among the factors considered by the boards of directors of both the Company and FMB in connection with their respective approvals of the merger agreement were the anticipated benefits that could result from the merger. There can be no assurance that these benefits will be realized within the time periods contemplated or at all.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities The following table presents stock purchases made during the third quarter of 2024: 

Period Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (2) Maximum Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs July 1 - 31, 2024 1,078 11.52 15,281,253 August 1 - 31, 2024 15,281,253 September 1 - 30, 2024 2,633 13.60 15,281,253 Total 3,711 13.00 15,281,253 

 (1) The total number of shares repurchased during the periods indicated includes shares repurchased as part of the Company s stock repurchase program and shares withheld for income tax purposes in connection with vesting of restricted stock and stock options. The shares were purchased or otherwise valued at the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of purchase and/or withholding. (2) On August 17, 2022, the Company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 25.0 million of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions. On July 23, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the stock repurchase program from August 16, 2024 to August 20, 2025. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock, and other than repurchases that have been completed to date, there is no assurance that the Company will do so. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares of common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, regulatory requirements, availability of funds, and other relevant considerations, as determined by the Company. The Company may, in its discretion, begin, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time prior to the Program s expiration, without any prior notice . Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None. Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the quarter ended , of the Company s directors or executive officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule b5-1(c) or any non-Rule b5-1 trading arrangement.
