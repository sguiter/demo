Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation:

 changes in the general interest rate environment;

 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 risks associated with the demand for liquidity under our share repurchase program and the continued approval of quarterly tender offers by the Board of Trustees (the Board ); 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with Blackstone Credit BDC Advisors LLC (the Adviser or any of its affiliates; 
 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 
 our use of financial leverage, including the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments and the availability of equity and debt capital on favorable terms or at all;

 the impact on our business of U.S. and international financial reform legislation, rules and regulations; 
 the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; and 
 the tax status of the enterprises in which we may invest. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of any projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in the section entitled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as updated by the Company's periodic filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).

 million and million, respectively, in non-recurring interest income (e.g., prepayment premiums, accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts, etc.). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded million and million, respectively, in non-recurring interest income. 
 PIK Income 
 The Company has loans in its portfolio that contain Payment-in-kind PIK provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. Such income is included in Payment-in-kind interest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest is generally reversed through Payment-in-kind interest income. To satisfy the Company s annual RIC distribution requirements, this non-cash source of income must be included in determining the amounts to be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected cash. 
 Dividend Income 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities and on the Company s equity interests in its joint ventures are recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.

 term and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the independent trustees. The Company may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon days written notice. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations. The Investment Advisory Agreement was renewed and approved by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, on May 1, 2024, for a period ending on May 31, 2025. 
 The Company pays the Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of components: a management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders. Substantial additional fees and expenses may also be charged by the Administrator to the Company, which is an affiliate of the Adviser. 
 Base Management Fees 
 The management fee is payable monthly and is settled and paid quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of the Company s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, net assets means the Company s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. The management fee calculation will be prorated for any partial months, including the first calendar month in which the Company commenced operations. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, base management fees were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, base management fees were million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, was payable to the Adviser relating to management fees. 
 Incentive Fees

 per quarter annualized). 
 The Company pays its Adviser an income based incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 No incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized); 
 of the dollar amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the catch-up. This catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 of the dollar amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of annualized). 
 These calculations are prorated for any period of less than three months, including the first quarter the Company commenced operations, and are adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. 
 (ii) Capital gains incentive fees 
 The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued income based incentive fees of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company accrued income based incentive fees of million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was million and million, respectively, payable to the Adviser for the income based incentive fees.

 of the NAV of the Company s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, such target amount is assessed each calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time (including to offer to purchase fewer shares) if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the best interest of shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect the Company s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, or may only be available in an amount less than of our Common Shares outstanding. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. Additionally, pursuant to Rule 23c-1(a)(10) under the 1940 Act, the Company may also repurchase its outstanding Common Shares outside of the share repurchase program. All shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The holding period will be satisfied if at least one year has elapsed from (a) the issuance date of the applicable Common Shares to (b) the subscription date immediately following the valuation date used in the repurchase of such Common Shares. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder; in the event that a shareholder s shares are repurchased because the shareholder has failed to maintain the 500 minimum account balance; due to trade or operational error; and repurchases of shares submitted by discretionary model portfolio management programs (and similar arrangements) as approved by the Company. In addition, the Company s Common Shares are sold to certain feeder vehicles primarily created to hold the Company s Common Shares that in turn offer interests in such feeder vehicles to non-U.S. persons. For such feeder vehicles and similar arrangements in certain markets, the Company will not apply the Early Repurchase Deduction to the feeder vehicles or underlying investors, often because of administrative or systems limitations. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders.

 Overview and Investment Framework 
 We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on February 11, 2020, we are externally managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser is registered as investment adviser with the SEC. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. 
 Under our investment advisory agreement dated October 5, 2020 (as amended and restated, the Investment Advisory Agreement ), we have agreed to pay the Adviser an annual management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Also, under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs. 
 Most of our investments are in U.S. private companies, but (subject to compliance with BDCs requirement to invest at least 70 of its assets in U.S. private companies), we also expect to invest to some extent in European and other non-U.S. companies, but we do not expect to invest in emerging markets. We may invest in companies of any size or capitalization. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other Blackstone Credit Insurance funds. We generally will co-invest with other Blackstone Credit Insurance funds. 
 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on loans and securities, including syndicated loans, of U.S. private companies. Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.

Table of Contents 

 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 In addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, and possibly consulting fees. 
 Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (a) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (b) our allocable portion of compensation, overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals (including information technology professionals) at the Administrator that perform duties for us; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of Blackstone or any of its affiliates; and (c) all other expenses of our operations, administrations and transactions. 
 From time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services on our behalf. We will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts. From time to time, the Adviser or the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 We have entered into the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. For additional information see Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions .

 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including acquisitions, the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. As a result, comparisons may not be meaningful. 
 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income, was as follows (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest income 1,535,300 1,310,101 4,392,412 3,816,495 Payment-in-kind interest income 93,679 61,432 281,578 153,916 Dividend income 64,649 84,286 224,941 227,074 Fee income 3,528 1,108 9,982 2,489 Total investment income 1,697,156 1,456,927 4,908,913 4,199,974 
 Total investment income increased to 1,697.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 240.2 million or 16 compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily driven by an increase in the average investments at fair value. Average investments at fair value increased by 23 to 59,028.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 47,925.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by a decrease in dividend income from our Emerald JV and Verdelite JV joint ventures which was 64.2 million as compared to 84.1 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 Total investment income increased to 4,908.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 708.9 million or 17 compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily driven by an increase in the average investments at fair value. Average investments at fair value increased by 15 to 55,168.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 48,105.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Additionally, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 3.9 million of non-recurring interest income (e.g., prepayment premiums, accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts, etc.) as compared to 1.6 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily a result of increased prepayments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 37.7 million of non-recurring interest income (e.g., prepayment premiums, accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts, etc.) as compared to 8.1 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily a result of increased prepayments.

Table of Contents 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Payment-in-kind interest income represented 5.5 and 4.2 of total investment income, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Payment-in-kind interest income represented 5.7 and 3.7 of total investment income, respectively. We expect that Payment-in-kind interest income will vary based on the elections of certain borrowers. 
 We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations, repayments and changes in interest rates. 
 While elevated interest rates continued to favorably impact our investment income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest rates have begun to decline, with the first Federal Reserve interest rate reduction in September 2024 and a further reduction in November 2024. Future decreases in benchmark interest rates may adversely impact our investment income. Conversely, future increases in benchmark interest rates and the resulting impacts to cost of capital have the potential to negatively impact the free cash flow and credit quality of certain borrowers which could impact their ability to make principal and interest payments. If such interest rate fluctuations occur concurrently with a period of economic weakness or a slowdown in growth, our borrowers and/or our portfolio performance may be negatively impacted. Further, significant market dislocation as a result of changing economic conditions could limit the liquidity of certain assets traded in the credit markets, and this could impact our ability to sell such assets at attractive prices or in a timely manner.

This was primarily driven by an increase in our average principal of debt outstanding to 24,471.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 23,929.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Our weighted average interest rate (including unused fees, accretion of net discounts on unsecured debt, and the impact of the application of hedge accounting and excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) remained flat at 7.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

This was primarily driven by an increase in our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings relative to the prior period, partially offset by a decrease in our average principal of debt outstanding. 
 Our weighted average interest rate (including unused fees, accretion of net discounts on unsecured debt, and the impact of the application of hedge accounting and excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) increased to 7.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.71 for the same period in the prior year.

 Management fees increased to 312.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 83.4 million or 36 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in weighted average net assets to 33,467.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24,557.6 million for the same period in the prior year.

 Income based incentive fees increased to 139.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 25.7 million or 23 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income. Pre-incentive fee net investment income increased to 1,115.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 909.8 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 Income based incentive fees increased to 399.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 75.0 million or 23 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income. Pre-incentive fee net investment income increased to 3,191.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,591.8 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 Capital Gains Based Incentive Fees 
 We accrued no capital gains incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. 
 Other Expenses 
 Total other expenses increased to 34.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.3 million as compared to the same period in the prior year. Total other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are primarily comprised of 25.3 million of distribution and shareholder servicing fees paid with respect to Class S and Class D investors, 3.9 million of general and administrative expenses (including insurance, filing, research, and fees paid to our sub-administrator and transfer agent), and 2.8 million of professional fees (including legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees related to management of the Company). The increase compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the costs attributable to increased subscriptions to our Class S and Class D shares.

The increase compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the costs attributable to increased subscriptions to our Class S and Class D shares. 
 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for and maintain qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for taxation as a RIC, we must distribute to our shareholders, in each taxable year, generally at least 90 of the sum of (i) our investment company taxable income for that year (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses and (ii) our net tax-exempt income. 
 In addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, we are subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98 of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (iii) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued 7.0 million and 9.7 million, respectively, of U.S. federal excise tax. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued 25.4 million and 23.1 million, respectively, of U.S. federal excise tax. 
 
 Net Unrealized Gain (Loss)

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net change in unrealized losses of 81.8 million was primarily driven by a decrease in the fair value of our debt investments. The fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal decreased by 0.1 from 97.9 as of June 30, 2024 to 97.8 as of September 30, 2024, driven by changes in portfolio company fundamentals and changes in the economic outlook. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net change in unrealized losses of 8.5 million and 7.6 million on derivative instruments and foreign currency and other transactions, respectively, were primarily as a result of fluctuations in the EUR and GBP exchange rates vs. USD.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net change in unrealized gains of 45.1 million was primarily driven by the increase in the fair value of our debt investments. The fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal increased by 0.4 from 97.4 as of December 31, 2023 to 97.8 as of September 30, 2024, driven by improved portfolio company fundamentals and changes in the economic outlook. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net change in unrealized gains of 9.4 million and 2.6 million on foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency transactions, respectively, were primarily as a result of fluctuations in the NOK, EUR and DKK exchange rates vs. USD.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated net realized losses on investments of 62.0 million and 126.5 million, respectively,which was primarily from full or partial sales and restructures of our debt investments. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated net realized losses of 14.2 million and 14.6 million, respectively, on derivative assets and derivative liabilities as a result of the settlement of our foreign currency derivative transactions. 
 The net realized losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were partially offset by the net realized gains of 7.9 million and 12.0 million, respectively, on foreign currency and other transactions, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP and EUR exchange rates vs. USD.

 With respect to distributions, we have adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan for shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared cash distribution or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the distribution reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional Common Shares rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of Common Shares will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 For additional information on our distributions and dividend reinvestment plan, see Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9. Net Assets . 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 The Company has implemented a share repurchase program under which, at the discretion of the Board, the Company may repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of the NAV of the Company s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, such target amount is assessed each calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time (including to offer to purchase fewer shares) if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the best interest of shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect the Company s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, or may only be available in an amount less than 5 of our Common Shares outstanding. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. Additionally, pursuant to Rule 23c-1(a)(10) under the 1940 Act, the Company may also repurchase its outstanding Common Shares outside of the share repurchase program. All Common Shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 246 

Table of Contents 

 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase Common Shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase Common Shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period will be satisfied if at least one year has elapsed from (a) the issuance date of the applicable Common Shares to (b) the subscription date immediately following the valuation date used in the repurchase of such Common Shares. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder; in the event that a shareholder s Common Shares are repurchased because the shareholder has failed to maintain the 500 minimum account balance; due to trade or operational error; and repurchases of Common Shares submitted by discretionary model portfolio management programs (and similar arrangements) as approved by the Company. In addition, the Company s Common Shares are sold to certain feeder vehicles primarily created to hold the Company s Common Shares that in turn offer interests in such feeder vehicles to non-U.S. persons. For such feeder vehicles and similar arrangements in certain markets, the Company will not apply the Early Repurchase Deduction to the feeder vehicles or underlying investors, often because of administrative or systems limitations. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders.

 Borrowings 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate principal amount of 26,657.5 million and 23,407.8 million, respectively, of debt outstanding. 
 For additional information on our debt obligations see Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Borrowings . 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 We use interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate liabilities, and have designated certain interest rate swaps to be in a hedge accounting relationship.

Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6. Derivatives for additional disclosure regarding our derivative instruments designated in a hedge accounting relationship. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Portfolio Company Commitments 
 Our investment portfolio contains and is expected to continue to contain debt investments which are in the form of lines of credit or delayed draw commitments, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with underlying loan agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unfunded commitments, including delayed draw term loans and revolvers with an aggregate principal amount of 9,565.0 million and 5,370.8 million, respectively. 
 Additionally, from time to time, the Adviser and its affiliates may commit to an investment on behalf of the investment vehicles it manages, including the Company. Certain terms of these investments are not finalized at the time of the commitment and each respective investment vehicle s allocation may change prior to the date of funding. In this regard, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimate that 750.7 million and 399.5 million, respectively, of investments were committed but not yet funded. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 502.5 million and 340.8 million, respectively, of capital committed remained uncalled from the Company in relation to capital commitments to Emerald JV, Verdelite JV and SLC.

See Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions . 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2024 have been characterized by continued uncertainty in global markets, driven by investor concerns over inflation, elevated interest rates, slowing economic growth, political and regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical conditions, including the wars in Ukraine and Russia and in the Middle East. 
 During 2023 and throughout the first three quarters of 2024, inflation began to moderate as a result of the monetary policy tightening actions taken by central banks, including maintaining elevated interest rates. Despite the Federal Reserve s interest rate reductions during the third quarter and first half of the fourth quarter, interest rates remain elevated relative to the interest rate environment prior to the inflationary spike in 2022-2023, which continues to create further uncertainty for the economy and for our borrowers. Future decreases in benchmark interest rates may adversely impact our investment income. Although our business model is such that elevated interest rates will, all else being equal, correlate to increases in our net income, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our existing borrowers and lead to nonperformance, as higher costs may dampen consumer spending and slow corporate profit growth, which may negatively impact our portfolio companies as they may be susceptible to economic downturns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. Although additional interest rate increases are not expected in the near term, during periods in which interest rates rise further, our non-performing assets may increase and the value of our portfolio may decrease if we are required to write down the values of our investments. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of recent changes and any future changes with respect to interest rates or inflation. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and practices.

 As of September 30, 2024, of our performing debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates. Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure) (dollar amounts in thousands): Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income (1)

 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. An evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer. 
 Based upon this evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are (a) effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

It is understood that in these circumstances, as contemplated by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the commissions paid may be higher than those which the Fund might otherwise have paid to another broker if those services had not been provided. Information so received will be in addition to and not in lieu of the services required to be performed by the Adviser. It is understood that the expenses of the Adviser will not necessarily be reduced as a result of the receipt of such information or research. Research services furnished to the Adviser by brokers who effect securities transactions for the Fund may be used by the Adviser in servicing other investment companies, entities or funds and accounts which it manages. Similarly, research services furnished to the Adviser by brokers who effect securities transactions for other investment companies, entities or funds and accounts which the Adviser manages may be used by the Adviser in servicing the Fund. It is understood that not all of these research services are used by the Adviser in managing any particular account, including the Fund. 
 The Adviser and its affiliates may aggregate purchase or sale orders for the assets with purchase or sale orders for the same security for other clients accounts of the Adviser or of its affiliates, the Adviser s own accounts and hold proprietary positions in accordance with its current aggregation and allocation policy (collectively, the Advisory Clients ), but only if (x) in the Adviser s reasonable judgment such aggregation results in 
 10 

an overall economic or other benefit to the assets taking into consideration the advantageous selling or purchase price, brokerage commission and other expenses and factors and (y) the Adviser s actions with respect to aggregating orders for multiple Advisory Clients, as well as the Fund, are consistent with applicable law. However, the Adviser is under no obligation to aggregate any such orders under any circumstances. 
 (b) All Front End Fees (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) shall be reasonable and shall not exceed 18 of the gross proceeds of any offering, regardless of the source of payment and the percentage of gross proceeds of any offering committed to investment shall be at least eighty-two percent (82 ). All items of compensation to underwriters or dealers, including, but not limited to, selling commissions, expenses, rights of first refusal, consulting fees, finders fees and all other items of compensation of any kind or description paid by the Fund, directly or indirectly, shall be taken into consideration in computing the amount of allowable Front End Fees. 
 5. Remuneration . 
 The Fund agrees to pay, and the Adviser agrees to accept, as compensation for the services provided by the Adviser hereunder, a base management fee and an incentive fee as hereinafter set forth. The Fund shall make any payments due hereunder to the Adviser or to the Adviser s designee as the Adviser may otherwise direct, including any sub-adviser. 
 (a) Management Fee . The management fee is accrued monthly and paid quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the Fund s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. 
 (b) Incentive Fee . The incentive fee will consist of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Fund s income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Fund s capital gains, each as described below. 
 (i) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income . The portion based on the Fund s income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Fund receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Fund s operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee and any distribution or shareholder servicing fees). 
 11 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Fund has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of 1.25 per quarter (5.0 annualized). 
 The Fund will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows 
 no incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.25 
 100 of the dollar amount of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). This is referred to as Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.43 as the catch-up and 
 12.5 of the dollar amount of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). 
 (ii) Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains . The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. 
 The amount payable equals 
 12.5 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. The Fund 
 12 

will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Fund were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to this Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), including Section 205 thereof. 
 The fees that are payable under this Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. 
 6. Representations and Warranties . 
 (a) The Adviser represents and warrants that it is duly registered and authorized as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, and the Adviser agrees to maintain effective all material requisite registrations, authorizations and licenses, as the case may be, until the termination of this Agreement. 
 (b) The Adviser shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared and distributed to shareholders during each year the following reports of the Fund (either included in a periodic report filed with the SEC or distributed in a separate report) (i) within sixty (60) days of the end of each quarter, a report containing the same financial information contained in the Fund s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by the Fund under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and (ii) within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of the Fund s fiscal year, an annual report that shall include financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP which are audited and reported on by independent certified public accountants (ii) a report of the material activities of the Fund during the period covered by the report (iii) where forecasts have been provided to the Fund s shareholders, a table comparing the forecasts previously provided with the actual results during the period covered by the report and (iv) a report setting forth distributions to the Fund s shareholders for the period covered thereby and separately identifying distributions from (A) cash flow from operations during the period (B) cash flow from operations during a prior period which have been held as reserves (C) proceeds from disposition of assets and (D) reserves from the gross proceeds of the Fund s offering. 
 (c) From time to time and not less than quarterly, the Fund shall cause the Adviser to review the Fund s accounts to determine whether cash distributions are appropriate. The Fund may, subject to authorization by the Board of Trustees, distribute pro rata to the Fund s shareholders funds which the Board deems unnecessary to retain in the Fund. The Board may from time to time authorize the Fund to declare and pay to the Fund s shareholders such dividends or other distributions, in cash or other assets of the Fund or in securities of the Fund, including in shares of one class or series payable to the holders of the shares of another class or series, or from any other source as the Board of Trustees in its discretion shall determine. Any such cash distributions to the Adviser shall be made only in conjunction with distributions to shareholders and only out of funds properly allocated to the Adviser s account. All such cash distributions shall be made 
 13 

only out of funds legally available therefor pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time. 
 (d) The Adviser shall, in its sole discretion, temporarily place proceeds from offerings by the Fund of its equity securities into short-term, highly liquid investments which, in its reasonable judgment, afford appropriate safety of principal during such time as it is determining the composition and allocation of the portfolio of the Fund and the nature, timing and implementation of any changes thereto pursuant to Section 1 of the this Agreement provided however, that the Adviser shall be under no fiduciary obligation to select any such short-term, highly liquid investment based solely on any yield or return of such investment. The Adviser shall cause any proceeds of the offering of Fund securities not committed for investment within the later of two years from the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement or one year from termination of the offering, unless a longer period is permitted by the applicable State Administrator, to be paid as a distribution to the shareholders of the Fund as a return of capital without deduction of a sales load. 
 7. Services Not Deemed Exclusive . The Fund and the Board of Trustees acknowledge and agree that 
 (a) the services provided hereunder by the Adviser are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Adviser and any of its affiliates or related persons are free to render similar services to others and to use the research developed in connection with this Agreement for other Advisory Clients or affiliates. The Fund agrees that the Adviser may give advice and take action with respect to any of its other Advisory Clients which may differ from advice given or the timing or nature of action taken with respect to any client or account so long as it is the Adviser s policy, to the extent practicable, to allocate investment opportunities to the client or account on a fair and equitable basis relative to its other Advisory Clients. It is understood that the Adviser shall not have any obligation to recommend for purchase or sale any loans which its principals, affiliates or employees may purchase or sell for its or their own accounts or for any other client or account if, in the opinion of the Adviser, such transaction or investment appears unsuitable, impractical or undesirable for the Fund. Nothing herein shall be construed as constituting the Adviser an agent of the Fund and 
 (b) the Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest as described in the Fund s Registration Statement and or the Fund s periodic filings with the SEC (as such disclosures may be updated from time to time) and such disclosures have been provided, and any updates will be provided, to the Board of Trustees in connection with its consideration of this Agreement and any future renewal of this Agreement.

 15 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8(a) to the contrary, the Fund shall not provide for indemnification of an Indemnified Party for any liability or loss suffered by an Indemnified Party, nor shall the Fund provide that any of the Indemnified Parties be held harmless for any loss or liability suffered by the Fund, unless all of the following conditions are met

Exhibit A 
 (a) Management Fee . The management fee is accrued monthly and paid quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the Fund s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. 
 (b) Incentive Fee . The incentive fee will consist of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Fund s income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Fund s capital gains, each as described below. 
 (i) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income . The portion based on the Fund s income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Fund receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Fund s operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee and any distribution or shareholder servicing fees). 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Fund has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of 1.25 per quarter (5.0 annualized). 
 The Fund will pay the Adviser, which in turn will pay to the Sub-Adviser, an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows 
 no incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.25 

100 of the dollar amount of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). This is referred to as Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.43 as the catch-up and 
 12.5 of the dollar amount of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). 
 (ii) Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains . The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. 
 The amount payable equals 
 12.5 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. The Fund will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser, and in turn to the Sub-Adviser, if the Fund were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to this Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, including Section 205 thereof.

Any Shareholder who is a resident of an Opt-In State or is a client of a participating broker-dealer that does not permit automatic enrollment in the Plan who has received the Prospectus will become a Participant if they elect to become a Participant by noting such election on their subscription agreement.

 5. Purchase of Shares. 
 a. The Fund shall use newly-issued Shares to implement the Plan.

 7. Taxes. THE REINVESTMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS DOES NOT RELIEVE A PARTICIPANT OF ANY INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MAY BE PAYABLE ON THE DISTRIBUTIONS. INFORMATION REGARDING POTENTIAL TAX INCOME LIABILITY OF PARTICIPANTS MAY BE FOUND IN THE PUBLIC FILINGS MADE BY THE FUND WITH THE SEC. 
 8. Share Certificates. The ownership of the Shares purchased through the Plan will be in book-entry form unless and until the Fund issues certificates for its outstanding Shares. 
 9. Termination by Participant. A Participant may terminate participation in the Plan at any time, without penalty, by delivering notice to the Plan Administrator. Such notice must be received by the Plan Administrator five business days in advance of the first calendar day of the next month in order for a Participant s termination to be effective for such month. Any transfer of Shares by a Participant to a non-Participant will terminate participation in the Plan with respect to the transferred Shares. If a Participant elects to tender its Shares in full, any Shares issued to the Participant under the Plan subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer will be considered part of the Participant s request to tender its shares in full, and Participant s participation in the Plan will be terminated as of the valuation date of the applicable tender offer. Any distributions to be paid to such Shareholder on or after such date will be paid in cash on the scheduled distribution payment date. If a Participant elects to tender a portion of its Shares, such Shareholder will remain a Participant in the Plan with respect to its Shares that were not repurchased (even if they are Shares that such Shareholder requested for repurchase). If a Participant terminates Plan participation, the Fund may, at its option, ensure that the terminating Participant s account will reflect the whole number of Shares in such Participant s account and provide a check for the cash value of any fractional Share in such account. Upon termination of Plan participation for any reason, future Distributions will be distributed to the Shareholder in cash. 
 10. Amendment, Suspension or Termination by the Fund. The Board of Trustees may by majority vote amend any aspect of the Plan provided that the Plan cannot be amended to eliminate a Participant s right to terminate participation in the Plan and that notice of any material amendment must be provided to Participants at least 10 business days prior to the effective date of that amendment. The Board of Trustees may by majority vote suspend or terminate the Plan for any reason upon 10 business days written notice to the Participants. 
 11. Liability of the Fund. The Fund shall not be liable for any act done in good faith, or for any good faith omission to act, including, without limitation, any claims or liability (i) arising out of failure to terminate a Participant s account upon such Participant s death prior to timely receipt of notice in writing of such death or (ii) with respect to the time and the prices at which Shares are purchased or sold for a Participant s account. To the extent that indemnification may apply to liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of a particular state, the Fund has been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC and certain state securities commissioners, such indemnification is contrary to public policy and, therefore, unenforceable. 
 12. Applicable Law. These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

 The disclosure reproduced below was initially included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Blackstone Inc. Blackstone with respect to its quarter ended September 30, 2024, in accordance with Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in regard to Mundys S.p.A. (formerly, Atlantia S.p.A.). Mundys S.p.A. may be, or may have been at the time considered to be, an affiliate of Blackstone, and therefore an affiliate of Blackstone Private Credit Fund BCRED ). BCRED did not independently verify or participate in the preparation of the disclosure reproduced below. 
 
 Blackstone included the following disclosure in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Mundys S.p.A. (formerly Atlantia S.p.A. provided the disclosure reproduced below in connection with activities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. We have not independently verified or participated in the preparation of this disclosure. 
 
 Disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Funds affiliated with Blackstone first invested in Mundys S.p.A. on November 18, 2022 in connection with the voluntary public tender offer by Schema Alfa S.p.A. for all of the shares of Mundys S.p.A., pursuant to which such funds obtained a minority non-controlling interest in Mundys S.p.A. Mundys S.p.A. owns and controls Aeroporti di Roma S.p.A. ADR ), an operator of airports in Italy including Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport. Iran Air has historically operated periodic flights to and from Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport as authorized, from time to time, by an aviation-related bilateral agreement between Italy and Iran, scheduled in compliance with European Regulation 95 93, and approved by the Italian Civil Aviation Authority. ADR, as airport operator, is under a mandatory obligation to provide airport services to all air carriers (including Iran Air) authorized by the applicable Italian authority. The relevant turnover attributable to these activities (whose consideration is calculated on the basis of general tariffs determined by such independent Italian authority) in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was less than 100,000. Mundys S.p.A. does not track profits specifically attributable to these activities.
