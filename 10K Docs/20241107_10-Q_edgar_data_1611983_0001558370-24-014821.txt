Spin-Off Arrangements During May 2014, the board of directors of Liberty Media Corporation and its subsidiaries Liberty authorized management to pursue a plan to spin-off to its stockholders common stock of a wholly owned subsidiary, Liberty Broadband, and to distribute subscription rights to acquire shares of Liberty Broadband s common stock (the Broadband Spin-Off ). In connection with the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty and Liberty Broadband entered into certain agreements in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the two companies and to provide for an orderly transition, including a services agreement and a facilities sharing agreement. Additionally, in connection with a prior transaction, GCI Liberty and Qurate Retail, Inc.

Under the facilities sharing agreement, Liberty Broadband shares office space with Liberty and related amenities at Liberty s corporate headquarters. Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty provides Liberty Broadband with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support. Liberty Broadband reimburses Liberty for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Liberty in providing these services which are negotiated semi-annually, as necessary. Pursuant to the services agreement, in connection with Liberty s employment arrangement with Gregory B. Maffei, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, components of Mr. Maffei s compensation are either paid directly to him or reimbursed to Liberty, based on allocations set forth in the services agreement, currently set at for the Company but subject to adjustment on an annual basis and upon the occurrence of certain events.

The Company isolates the portion of the unrealized gain (loss) attributable to the change in the instrument specific credit risk and recognizes such amount in other comprehensive income. The change in the fair value of the exchangeable senior debentures attributable to changes in the instrument specific credit risk before tax was a gain of million and a loss of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net of the recognition of previously unrecognized gains and losses, and gains of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net of the recognition of previously unrecognized gains and losses .

Changes in the contract liability balance for the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were not materially impacted by other factors.

This measure of performance excludes depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net earnings, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Overview Liberty Broadband Corporation Liberty Broadband, the Company, us, we, or our is primarily comprised of GCI Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary, and an equity method investment in Charter. On December 18, 2020, GCI Liberty, Inc. GCI Liberty ), the parent company of GCI Holdings, was acquired by Liberty Broadband (the Combination ). Through a number of prior years transactions, including the Combination, Liberty Broadband has acquired an interest in Charter. Liberty Broadband controls 25.01 of the aggregate voting power of Charter. Update on Economic Conditions GCI Holdings GCI Holdings offers wireless and wireline telecommunication services, data services, video services, and managed services to customers primarily throughout Alaska. Because of this geographic concentration, growth of GCI Holdings business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska. In recent years, varying factors have contributed to significant volatility and disruption of financial markets and global supply chains. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve increased interest rates starting in March 2022 and throughout 2023, though they have started decreasing rates in 2024. Mounting inflationary cost pressures and recessionary fears have negatively impacted the U.S. and global economy. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S., or inflation in the markets in which GCI operates, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for GCI s products and services and its cost of doing business. The Alaska economy is dependent upon the oil industry, state and federal spending, investment earnings and tourism. A decline in oil prices would put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget. The Alaska state government has financial reserves that GCI Holdings believes may be able to help fund the state government for the next couple of years. The Alaska economy is subject to recessionary pressures as a result of the economic impacts of volatility in oil prices, inflation, and other causes that could result in a decrease in economic activity. While it is difficult for GCI Holdings to predict the future impact of a recession on its business, these conditions have had an adverse impact on its business and could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of its products and services and cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of its products and services. GCI Holdings customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to GCI Holdings and could lead to an increase in accounts receivable and bad debt expense. If a recession occurs, it could negatively affect GCI

 Holdings business including its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as its ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns. In addition, during 2023 and continuing in 2024, GCI Holdings began to experience the impact of inflation-sensitive items, including upward pressure on the costs of materials, labor, and other items that are critical to GCI Holdings business. GCI Holdings continues to monitor these impacts closely and, if costs continue to rise, GCI Holdings may be unable to recoup losses or offset diminished margins by passing these costs through to its customers or implementing offsetting cost reductions. RHC Program GCI Holdings receives support from various USF programs including the RHC Program. The USF programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC, interpretations of or compliance with USF program rules, or legislative actions. The USF programs have also been subject to legal challenge, which could disrupt or eliminate the support GCI Holdings receives. Changes to any of the USF programs that GCI Holdings participates in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on GCI Holdings business and the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company does not have any significant updates regarding GCI Holdings involvement in the RHC Program as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Charter Charter is a leading broadband connectivity company and cable operator with services available to more than 58 million homes and businesses in 41 states through its Spectrum brand. During the third quarter of 2024, Charter lost 110,000 Internet customers while adding 545,000 mobile lines. Charter s Internet customer growth was challenged by the end of the FCC s Affordable Connectivity Program ("ACP"), lower customer move rates and the competitive environment. While Charter s retention programs for the customers impacted by the end of ACP subsidies have been successful in retaining the vast majority of ACP customers, the end of the ACP subsidy program has been disruptive to its business and resulted in customer losses during the quarter. Charter expects to see additional one-time impacts on customer net gains, revenue per customer and bad debt in the fourth quarter of this year. Charter s mobile line growth continued to benefit from the Spectrum One offering and new offerings launched in 2024, including Charter s Anytime Upgrade offering and Phone Balance Buyout program. Charter s Spectrum One offering provides a differentiated connectivity experience by bringing together Spectrum Internet, Advanced WiFi and Unlimited Spectrum Mobile to offer consumers fast, reliable and secure online connections on their favorite devices at home and on the go in a high-value package. Anytime Upgrade allows certain customers to upgrade their devices whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees and condition requirements. The Phone Balance Buyout program makes switching mobile providers easier by helping customers pay off balances on ported lines. Charter spent 581 million and 1.6 billion on its subsidized rural construction initiative during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and activated approximately 114,000 and 276,000 subsidized rural passings, respectively. Charter currently offers Spectrum Internet products with speeds up to 1 Gbps across its entire footprint. Its network evolution initiative is progressing. Charter is upgrading its network to deliver symmetrical and multi-gigabit speeds across its footprint, and recently began offering symmetrical speeds in its first high split markets. In 2024, Charter began offering certain programmer streaming applications including, among others, Disney+, ESPN+, ViX Premium and Paramount+ to customers in certain packages and reached agreements with several other programmers that will add Max, Discovery+, Peacock, BET+, AMC+ and Tennis Channel Plus in certain packages. Charter now has completed deals with every major programmer to create better flexibility and greater value to customers by including programmer streaming apps with Spectrum TV services at no additional cost. Charter also continues to evolve its video product and is deploying Xumo stream boxes ("Xumo") to new video customers. Xumo combines a live TV experience with access to hundreds of content applications and features unified search and discovery along with a curated content offering based on the customer s interests and subscriptions. In September 2024, Charter launched its Life Unlimited brand platform which includes a new customer

 commitment that provides performance and service benchmarks and a new and simplified pricing structure designed to drive more value into Charter s relationships. By continually improving its product set and offering consumers the opportunity to save money by switching to its services, Charter believes it can continue to penetrate its expanding footprint and sell additional products to its existing customers. Charter sees operational benefits from the targeted investments made in employee wages and benefits to build employee skill sets and tenure, as well as the continued investments in digitization of Charter s customer service platforms, all with the goal of improving the customer experience, reducing transactions and driving customer growth and retention.

 Operating loss for Corporate and other increased 3 million and improved 1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods, due to increased labor related costs, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation. The nine month period was also impacted by decreased professional service fees. Adjusted OIBDA To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA.

The Company s share of earnings (losses) of affiliate line item in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations includes expenses of 65 million and 71 million, net of related taxes, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 234 million and 205 million, net of related taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the change in amortization of the excess basis of assets with identifiable useful lives and debt, which increased for the nine month period primarily due to a cumulative change in the applicable tax rate. The change in the share of earnings of affiliate in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, was the result of the corresponding increase in net income at Charter. The following is a discussion of Charter s results of operations. In order to provide a better understanding of Charter s operations, we have included a summarized presentation of Charter s results from operations.

Revenue growth was also favorably impacted by 68 million of total customer credits in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming during the third quarter of 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, increased 5 million and decreased 144 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Operating costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, were impacted by lower programming costs as a result of fewer video customers and a higher mix of lower cost video packages within Charter s video customer base as well as costs allocated to programmer streaming apps which are netted within video revenue, partly offset by contractual rate adjustments, including renewals and increases in amounts paid for retransmission consent as well as a 61 million benefit related to the temporary loss of Disney programming during the third quarter of 2023. Lower programming costs were offset by higher mobile service direct costs and mobile device sales due to an increase in mobile lines. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, the increases in operating costs described above slightly exceeded the decrease in programming costs. For the nine months ended

Charter s Adjusted OIBDA increased 206 million and 407 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, for the reasons described above. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 15 million and decreased 3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Other expenses, net increased 134 million and 200 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increases in other expenses, net were primarily due to increased interest expense caused by an increase in weighted average interest rates and increased losses on financial instruments, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Charter recognized income tax expense of 406 million and 369 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1,279 million and 1,187 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gain (loss) on dilution of investment in affiliate The loss on dilution of investment in affiliate was relatively flat during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net are comprised of changes in the fair value of the following: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 amounts in millions Exchangeable senior debentures (144) (69) (85) (158) Other (12) 3 (144) (81) (85) (155) The changes in these accounts are primarily due to market factors and changes in the fair value of the underlying stocks or financial instruments to which these related (see notes 3 and 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional discussion). The changes in realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, were primarily due to the change in fair value of the debentures outstanding for the respective periods related to changes in market price of the underlying Charter stock. Other, net Other, net income decreased 3 million and 7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The changes were primarily due to a tax sharing receivable with Qurate Retail, Inc. Qurate Retail ). The tax sharing receivable with Qurate Retail resulted in tax sharing income of zero and 3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to tax sharing income of 4 million and 12 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. See more discussion about the tax sharing agreement with Qurate Retail in note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The remaining variance is the result of dividend and interest income.

 Income taxes Earnings (losses) before income taxes and income tax (expense) benefit are as follows: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 amounts in millions Earnings (loss) before income taxes 181 208 743 626 Income tax (expense) benefit (39) (46) (165) (143) Effective income tax rate 22 22 22 23 The difference between the effective income tax rate of 22 and the U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the effect of state income taxes, certain non-deductible expenses and stock-based compensation, partially offset by federal tax credits. The differences between the effective income tax rate of 22 and 23 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and the U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21 were primarily due to the effect of state income taxes, certain non-deductible expenses and the impact of non-taxable amounts due to changes in the fair value of the indemnification payable owed to Qurate Retail. Net earnings (loss) The Company had net earnings of 142 million and 162 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net earnings of 578 million and 483 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in net earnings (loss) was the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other income and expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, other government securities or government guaranteed funds, AAA rated money market funds and other highly rated financial and corporate debt instruments. The following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, cash generated by the operating activities of our privately-owned subsidiaries (to the extent such cash exceeds the working capital needs of the subsidiaries and is not otherwise restricted), monetization of investments (including Charter Repurchases (as defined in note 4 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and discussed below)), outstanding or anticipated debt facilities (as discussed in note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), debt and equity issuances, and dividend and interest receipts. As of September 30, 2024, Liberty Broadband had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 168 million.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows provided by and used in investing activities included capital expenditures of 183 million and 149 million, respectively, and purchases of equity securities during 2023. This net outflow of cash for capital expenditures was offset by the sale of 698,011 and 120,149 shares of Charter Class A common stock to Charter for 226 million and 42 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to maintain our fully diluted ownership percentage of Charter at 26 . In February 2021, Liberty Broadband entered into a letter agreement in order to implement, facilitate and satisfy the terms of the Stockholders Agreement with respect to the Equity Cap (see more information in note 4 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements). The Company expects the Charter Repurchases to be the primary source of liquidity in future periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in financing activities were primarily for the repurchase of approximately 300 million in aggregate principal amount of the 3.125 Debentures due 2053 (see more information in note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) and net repayments of approximately 670 million on the Margin Loan Agreement (as defined in note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), partly offset by the issuance of 860 million aggregate original principal amount of its 3.125 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2054 and net borrowings of approximately 30 million on the Senior Credit Facility. Additionally, net cash flows used in financing activities included repurchases of Liberty Broadband Series A and Series C common stock of 89 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in financing activities were primarily for the repurchase of approximately 1,415 million in principal amount of outstanding exchangeable senior debentures, partially offset by the issuance of 1,265 million aggregate original principal amount of the 3.125 Debentures due 2053 (see more information in note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), as well as net borrowings of approximately 125 million of outstanding Revolving Loans (as defined in note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) under the Margin Loan Facility. Additionally, net cash flows used in financing activities included repurchases of Liberty Broadband Series A and Series C common stock of 40 million and indemnification payments of 26 million made by Liberty Broadband to Qurate Retail in connection with the LI LLC 1.75 exchangeable debentures due 2046 which was settled during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The projected uses of our cash for the remainder of 2024 are the potential buyback of common stock under the approved share buyback program, net capital expenditures of approximately 20 million, approximately 60 million for interest payments on outstanding debt, approximately 3 million for preferred stock dividends, funding of any operational needs of our subsidiaries, to reimburse Liberty Media Corporation for amounts due under various agreements and to fund potential investment opportunities. We expect corporate cash and other available sources of liquidity to cover corporate expenses for the foreseeable future. Debt Covenants GCI, LLC is subject to covenants and restrictions under its Senior Notes (as defined in note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) and Senior Credit Facility. The Company and GCI, LLC are in compliance with all debt maintenance covenants as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 
 Consumer data revenue increased 2 million and 4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increases were driven by subscribers selection of plans with higher recurring monthly charges. Consumer wireless revenue was flat and decreased 1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The decrease in the nine month period was driven by a decrease in the number of handset sales and a decrease in prepaid data plans. Consumer other revenue was flat and decreased 2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Consumer other revenue consists of consumer video and voice revenue. The decrease for the nine month period was due to a decrease in video revenue primarily driven by decreased video subscribers. Historically, GCI Holdings has seen declines in video and voice subscribers and revenue and expects a continued decrease as customers make decisions to move to alternative services. Business data revenue increased 20 million and 25 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to increased sales to health care and education customers due to service upgrades. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in business data subscribers. Business wireless revenue was flat and decreased 2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to changes in the number of subscribers. Business other revenue was flat and decreased 2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Business other revenue consists of business video and voice revenue. The decreases were primarily due to decreased local and long distance voice revenue. Historically, GCI Holdings has seen declines in video and voice subscribers and revenue and has not focused business efforts on growth in these areas. Operating expenses increased 5 million and 8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increases in both periods were primarily due to increases in distribution costs to health care, education and consumer customers, partially offset by decreases in handset product costs due to decreased handset sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6 million and 9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increases in both periods were primarily due to increases in labor related costs and to a lesser extent, software subscription costs, partially offset by a decrease in lease expense. Stock-based compensation was relatively flat for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Depreciation and amortization was flat and decreased 12 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The decrease for the nine month period was due to lower depreciation and amortization expense as certain fixed and intangible assets became fully depreciated during 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices and interest rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investment activities, which could include investments in fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. We manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from interest rate risk. We could achieve this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term to maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates and (iii) entering into interest rate swap arrangements when we deem appropriate. As of September 30, 2024, our debt is comprised of the following amounts: 

Variable rate debt Fixed rate debt Principal Weighted avg Principal Weighted avg amount interest rate amount interest rate dollar amounts in millions GCI Holdings 427 7.0 600 4.8 Corporate and other 790 6.5 1,825 3.1 Our investment in Charter (our equity method affiliate) is publicly traded and not reflected at fair value in our balance sheet. Our investment in Charter is also subject to market risk that is not directly reflected in our financial statements. Item 4. Controls and Procedures In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its chief executive officer and its principal accounting and financial officer (the "Executives"), and under the oversight of its board of directors, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Executives concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes "Legal Proceedings" under Item 3 of Part I. There have been no material changes from the legal proceedings described in our Form 10-K. Item 1A. Risk Factors Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes in the Company's risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. A potential transaction between the Company and Charter may not occur, could divert the attention of our management and will result in certain costs and expenses. As described in the Schedule 13D/A that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on September 23, 2024, on September 15, 2024, we received a non-binding letter from Charter Communications, Inc. Charter proposing a combination of the Company with Charter in an all-stock transaction (the Proposed Transaction and on September 23, 2024, we communicated a non-binding counterproposal to Charter. The Proposed Transaction is proposed to close on June 30, 2027 or such earlier date as the parties shall mutually agree. The Proposed Transaction is subject to further negotiation and no legally binding obligation with respect to the Proposed Transaction exists unless and until mutually acceptable definitive documentation is executed and delivered with respect thereto. There can be no assurance that the Proposed Transaction or any related transaction will be completed in a timely manner or at all, or, if completed, will be on the same terms as set out in our counterproposal. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement with Charter, we anticipate that the consummation of any Potential Transaction will be subject to a number of conditions, and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or waived. Our management may be required to divert a disproportionate amount of attention away from their day-to-day activities and operations, and devote time and effort to considering the Proposed Transaction. In addition, we expect to continue to incur costs in connection with the consideration of the Proposed Transaction, including costs of financial and legal advisors and costs associated with legal actions arising out of the Proposed Transactions. It is difficult to estimate the aggregate amount of such costs, although they could be substantial. Further, the currently proposed closing date of June 30, 2027, which may be further delayed, will likely result in a period leading up to closing that is longer than a typical closing period which heightens many of the risks described herein. The market price of our common stock may experience variation as a result of changing assumptions regarding the Proposed Transaction, independent of changes in our businesses, financial condition or prospects or changes in general market or economic conditions. As a result, definitive documentation regarding the Proposed Transaction, or a failure to reach definitive documentation regarding the Proposed Transaction or any related transaction, could result in a significant change in the market price of our common stock. A successful legal challenge to the constitutionality of the USF could disrupt or eliminate GCI Holdings USF support. There have been a number of legal challenges to the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund USF ), which have historically been ineffective. However, on July 24, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc ruled that the USF program is unconstitutional as currently administered, and remanded the case to the Federal Communications Commission FCC ). In its decision, the Fifth Circuit concluded that there was an impermissible public delegation of legislative authority to the FCC and an impermissible private delegation of authority from the FCC to the Universal Service Administrative Company, the private company responsible for USF administration. This differs from the decisions previously reached by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits. As a result, it is likely that additional cases and appeals will be filed in relation to the matter, including that a petition by the parties for a review of the Fifth Circuit decision in the U.S. Supreme Court would be granted. There is significant uncertainty regarding the outcome of any appeal on the issue, as well as whether any action taken by the FCC or Congress to resolve the issue would be sufficient 

 II-1

 and what impact such actions might have on the USF program. A Supreme Court ruling upholding the Fifth Circuit s decision or, more broadly, that the legislation establishing the USF program is unconstitutional could disrupt or eliminate GCI Holdings USF support unless and until any identified legal defects with the program structure or administration are remedied. Such a ruling would likely result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could likely have an adverse effect on GCI Holdings business and the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. USF support was 39 and 35 of GCI Holdings revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. GCI Holdings had USF net receivables of 102 million and 116 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Without USF support, telecommunications providers, including GCI Holdings, may need to consider various actions including, but not limited to, terminating certain high cost or low profit services, discontinuing rural networks or a reduction in workforce, which could have a negative impact on GCI Holdings business. Changes to the existing legal and regulatory framework under which Charter and GCI Holdings operate or the regulatory programs in which Charter, GCI Holdings or their competitors participate could adversely affect Charter and GCI Holdings businesses. There are ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state and local regulation of some of the services offered over Charter s cable systems, particularly Charter s retail broadband Internet access service. Potential legislative and regulatory changes could adversely impact Charter s business by increasing its costs and competition and limiting its ability to offer services in a manner that would maximize revenue potential. These changes have in the past, and could in the future, include, for example, the reclassification of Internet services as regulated telecommunications services or other utility-style regulation of Internet services; restrictions on how Charter manages its Internet access services and networks; the adoption of new customer service or service quality requirements for its Internet access services; the adoption of new privacy restrictions on its collection, use and disclosure of certain customer information; new data security and cybersecurity mandates that could result in additional network and information security and cyber incident reporting requirements for its business; new restraints on its discretion over programming decisions; new restrictions on the rates Charter charges to consumers for one or more of the services or equipment options it offers; changes to the cable industry s compulsory copyright to retransmit broadcast signals; new requirements to assure the availability of navigation devices from third-party providers; new USF contribution obligations on Charter s Internet service revenues that would add to the cost of that service; increases in government-administered broadband subsidies to rural areas that could result in subsidized overbuilding of its facilities; changes to the FCC s administration of spectrum; pending court challenges to the legality of the FCC s USF programs, which, if successful, could adversely affect receipt of universal service funds, including but not limited to FCC Rural Development Opportunity Fund RDOF grants to expand Charter s network, FCC E-rate funds to serve schools and libraries and FCC Rural Health Care funds to serve eligible health care providers; and changes in the regulatory framework for voice over Internet protocol ("VoIP") telephone service, including the scope of regulatory obligations associated with VoIP telephone service and Charter s ability to interconnect its VoIP telephone service with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications service. These changes may also have a similar impact on GCI Holdings business. For example, the Fifth Circuit recently ruled the USF program unconstitutional as currently administered and remanded the case to the FCC for further proceedings, which creates uncertainty as to the future of the USF program. The Fifth Circuit has stayed the effects of its decision while the FCC appeals it to the Supreme Court. For additional information on the potential impact of the Fifth Circuit s decision, see A successful legal challenge to the constitutionality of the USF could disrupt or eliminate GCI Holdings USF support above. Charter participated in the Affordable Connectivity Program ACP and continues to participate in the RDOF subsidy program, and GCI Holdings participated in the ACP subsidy program. The ACP program previously provided up to a 30 monthly subsidy enabling eligible low-income households to purchase Internet products at a discount or, for a portion of those households, at no cost for eligible Charter customers. The ACP programs provided up to a 75 monthly subsidy in Alaska for GCI Holdings eligible customers. The FCC prohibited service providers from enrolling new participants into the ACP after February 7, 2024 and April 2024 was the last month ACP households received the full ACP subsidy. ACP households received a 14 federally funded ACP subsidy in May 2024. As of June 1, 2024, ACP households no longer received the ACP benefit. The end of the ACP benefit has been, and will continue to be, disruptive to Charter s business, and to a lesser extent, GCI Holdings. Charter and GCI Holdings have lost and will continue to lose customers and revenue and could face greater difficulty in providing services to low-income households in the future. As a winning bidder in the FCC s RDOF auction in 2020, Charter must comply with numerous FCC and state requirements to continue receiving such funding. To comply with these requirements, in RDOF areas, Charter has chosen to 

 II-2 

Table of Contents 
 offer certain of its VoIP telephone services, such as its Lifeline services, subject to certain traditional federal and state common carrier regulations. Additionally, in some areas where Charter is building pursuant to subsidy programs, Charter will offer certain of its broadband Internet access services subject to required discounts and other marketing-related terms. If Charter fails to comply with those requirements, the governing regulatory agency could consider Charter in default and it could incur substantial penalties or forfeitures. If Charter fails to attain certain specified infrastructure build-out requirements under the RDOF program, the FCC could also withhold future support payments until those shortcomings are corrected. Any failure to comply with the rules and requirements of a subsidy grant could result in Charter being suspended or disbarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. Participation in ACP, RDOF, and other government programs, including state subsidized builds, creates the risk of claims of Charter and GCI Holdings failures to adequately comply with the regulatory requirements of those programs. The FCC, and various state and federal agencies and attorney generals, may subject those programs, or other industry practices, to audits and investigations, which could result in enforcement actions, litigation, fines, settlements or reputational harm, and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on Charter or GCI Holdings, any of which could adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition. If any laws or regulations are enacted that would expand the regulation of Charter and GCI Holdings services, they could affect their operations and require significant expenditures. It cannot be predicted how future developments in these areas, and any changes to the regulatory framework for Internet, video, mobile or VoIP services could have a negative impact on Charter and GCI Holdings businesses and results of operations. It remains uncertain what rule changes, if any, will ultimately be adopted by Congress, the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on Charter and GCI Holdings, including on the operation of their broadband networks, customer privacy and the user experience. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Share Repurchase Programs There were no repurchases of Liberty Broadband Series A, Series B or Series C common stock or Liberty Broadband Preferred Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares of Liberty Broadband Series A common stock, Liberty Broadband Series B common stock, Liberty Broadband Series C common stock or Liberty Broadband Preferred Stock were surrendered by our officers and employees to pay withholding taxes and other deductions in connection with the vesting or exercise of restricted stock.

Section 2.13 Amendment, Modification or Repeal .
