billion and million, and billion and billion, respectively, of unrealized gains (losses) on the Agency mortgage-backed securities, for which the fair value option was elected, were reported in Net gains (losses) on investments and other in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Agency mortgage-backed securities purchased prior to July 1, 2022, are still classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company has also elected the fair value option for CRT securities, interest only securities, Non-Agency and commercial mortgage-backed securities in order to simplify the accounting. Transactions for regular-way securities are recorded on trade date, including to-be-announced TBA securities that meet the regular-way securities scope exception from derivative accounting. Gains and losses on disposals of securities are recorded on trade date based on the specific identification method. 
 Impairment Management evaluates available-for-sale securities where the fair value option has not been elected and held-to-maturity debt securities for impairment at least quarterly, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. When the fair value of an available-for-sale security is less than its amortized cost, the security is considered impaired. For securities that are impaired, the Company determines if it (1) has the intent to sell the security, (2) is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Further, the security is analyzed for credit loss (the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis). The credit loss, if any, will then be

An impairment has not been recognized in earnings related to these investments because the decline in value is not related to credit quality, the Company currently has not made a decision to sell the securities nor is it more likely than not that the securities will be required to be sold before recovery.

billion at September 30, 2024. Assets of the VIEs may only be used to settle obligations of the VIEs. Creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to the general credit of the Company. The Company is not contractually required to provide and has not provided any form of financial support to the VIEs. No gains or losses were recognized upon consolidation of existing VIEs. Interest income and expense are recognized using the effective interest method. 
 Residential Securitizations 
 The Company also invests in residential mortgage-backed securities issued by entities that are VIEs because they do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entities to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The Company is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. For these entities, the Company s maximum exposure to loss is the amortized cost basis of the securities it owns and it does not provide any liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other commitments to these VIEs.

 billion and billion, respectively, of bonds were held by third parties and the Company retained billion and billion, respectively, of MBS, which were eliminated in consolidation. The Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and consolidates the OBX Trusts because it has power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the OBX Trusts performance and holds a variable interest that could be potentially significant to these VIEs. Effective August 1, 2022, upon initial consolidation of new securitization entities, the Company elected to apply the measurement alternative for consolidated collateralized financing entities in order to simplify the accounting and valuation processes. The liabilities of these securitization entities are deemed to be more observable and are used to measure the fair value of the assets. The Company incurred million and million of costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million of costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with these securitizations that were expensed as incurred.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded million and million, respectively, and million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of unrealized gains (losses) on debt held by third parties issued by OBX Trusts, which is reported in Net gains (losses) on investments and other in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 Although the residential mortgage loans have been sold for bankruptcy and state law purposes, the transfers of the residential mortgage loans to the OBX Trusts did not qualify for sale accounting and are reflected as intercompany secured borrowings that are eliminated upon consolidation. 
 Residential Credit Fund 
 The Company manages a fund investing in participations in residential mortgage loans. The residential credit fund is deemed to be a VIE because the entity does not have sufficient equity at risk to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties, including equity holders, as capital commitments are not considered equity at risk. The Company is not the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate the residential credit fund as its only interest in the fund is the management and performance fees that it earns, which are not considered variable interests in the entity. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding participating interests in residential mortgage loans of billion and billion, respectively. These transfers do not meet the criteria for sale accounting and are accounted for as secured borrowings, thus the residential loans are reported as Loans, net and the associated liability is reported as Participations issued in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Company elected the fair value option for participations issued with changes in fair value reflected in Net gains (losses) on investments and other in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) to more accurately reflect the economics of the transfers as the underlying loans are carried at fair value through earnings.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Overview 
 We are a leading diversified capital manager with investment strategies across mortgage finance. Our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and optimize our returns through prudent management of our diversified investment strategies. We are an internally-managed Maryland corporation founded in 1997 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NLY. 
 We use our capital coupled with borrowed funds to invest primarily in real estate related investments, earning the spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities. 
 For a full discussion of our business, refer to the section titled Business Overview in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Business Environment 
 Fixed income markets benefited from two positive trends in the third quarter Q3 2024 ). The Federal Reserve (the Fed commenced a cycle of lowering the Federal Funds Target Rate to less restrictive levels, while the U.S. economy generally maintained its strong pace of growth. Officials lowered the Federal Funds Target Rate by 50 basis points at the September Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meeting, lowering short-term interest rates for the first time since the July 2023 FOMC meeting. Fed officials signaled that they intend to ease monetary policy over time as current policy remains restrictive, with the pace and extent of easing dependent on incoming economic data. The Fed's cutting cycle will be geared at lowering interest rates to levels that promote a healthy, stable labor market while keeping inflation near its 2 target. Short-term interest rate markets currently price this neutral rate at 3.25 , though estimates have varied somewhat in recent weeks. 
 The change in monetary policy was driven by the labor market, as reduced demand for workers and slower hiring have moved labor supply and demand roughly in balance for the first time in the past three years. For much of the post-pandemic experience, strong demand for labor had exceeded available supply, leading to higher wage growth and the potential for a negative feedback loop between rising prices and rising wages. According to the minutes of the September FOMC meeting, Fed officials judged that risks of such a feedback loop appear to have declined. Inflation continues to normalize with personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy core PCE likely to run only slightly above 2 annualized in Q3 2024. 
 The market's pricing of additional rate cuts has led to a steeper yield curve, increasing the attractiveness of fixed income assets more broadly and Agency MBS in particular. In addition, interest rate volatility has continued to decline to the lowest levels since the March 2023 regional banking crisis, though it remains meaningfully above pre-pandemic historical average levels. These developments have been supportive of our diversified business model, as seen in the strong performance delivered in the quarter. We generated an economic return of 4.9 in Q3 2024 and our earnings available for distribution EAD exceeded our common dividend. We achieved these results with continued robust earnings power of our portfolio even with lower economic leverage, which decreased modestly during the quarter to 5.7x. 
 Our strong performance and the supportive backdrop for our investment strategies allowed us to raise over 1.1 billion of accretive common equity over the quarter through our at-the-market sales program. The environment to deploy capital remains attractive as the market value of all three of our business lines increased quarter over quarter. 
 With respect to our portfolio activity during the quarter, in light of the capital raised, our Agency MBS investments grew by over 4 billion notional value with the remaining increase in market value attributable to price appreciation. Despite the positive fixed income market backdrop, Agency MBS performance was bifurcated across coupons. Lower coupons benefited from strong money manager demand, while the decline in mortgage rates raised concerns regarding prepayment behavior in higher coupons, leading such coupons to underperform their respective interest rate hedges. Given this relative performance, we increased our allocation to 5.0 coupons and higher given their attractiveness relative to intermediate and lower coupons. This represents an extension of our methodical migration up the coupon stack over the last two years with a diligent focus on high-quality pool selection. For example, 6.0 coupons and higher represent roughly a quarter of our portfolio, though the majority of these higher coupon holdings are held in specified pool form that offer significant protections from higher prepayment speeds. 
 Our outlook for the Agency MBS sector remains favorable. Notably, the supply and demand technical factors, often a headwind over the past few years, have continued to improve as net supply is trending lower, likely reaching levels somewhat below 2023 totals. Meanwhile, fixed income flows have helped improve money manager demand for this year, which is currently running at nearly double the estimated pace from last year. In addition, appetite from banks and overseas investors should increase as the Fed s normalization of interest rates, leading the spread between MBS yields and deposit rates to increase and currency hedging costs to decline. 
 We maintained conservative interest rate exposure throughout the quarter, while benefiting from a position geared towards the steepening of the yield curve that ultimately took place during the quarter. As interest rate levels declined throughout Q3 2024,

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 we proactively managed our rate exposure, shifting hedges across the yield curve as mortgage durations contracted. Going forward, we expect continued interest rate volatility driven by the upcoming elections, geopolitical risks and the trajectory of fiscal deficits, which present uncertainty around the terminal level of interest rates. 
 Meanwhile our Residential Credit portfolio increased approximately 535 million in Q3 2024 to 6.5 billion in economic market value and 2.3 billion of dedicated capital, representing 18 of the firm s equity. Growth continued to be driven by our correspondent platform with our residential whole loan and retained Onslow Bay OBX securitization portfolio. 
 Capitalizing on firm credit spreads, which moved in roughly a 10 basis point range during the quarter, we closed six securitizations totaling 3.2 billion in unpaid principal balance. Since the beginning of 2024, we have now priced 18 securitizations totaling 9.4 billion, establishing Onslow Bay as the largest non-bank securitization sponsor in the residential credit market and second largest overall. The quarter once again produced record volumes across both locks and fundings at 4.4 billion and 2.9 billion, respectively. Our diligent focus on underwriting sound credit risk and proactive asset management has led to OBX Non-QM securitizations having the lowest delinquencies across the top 10 largest issuers in the market. The Residential Credit business remains well-positioned given the optionality of our growing correspondent channel and our ability to manufacture high-yielding assets across various spread environments. 
 We continued to grow our holdings of mortgage servicing rights MSR to 2.8 billion in market value as we committed to purchase a bulk transaction comprising 125 million in market value, which is expected to settle before year-end 2024. The mark on the portfolio decreased slightly in the quarter given a relatively sharp 80 basis point decline in the mortgage rate, highlighting the durability of a portfolio whose average refinancing incentive is 300 basis points below current mortgage rates. Fundamental performance of the portfolio remained strong as the 3-month annualized prepayment speed of the portfolio was 3.9 , serious delinquencies were minimal at 45 basis points, deposit income remains elevated given the shape of the yield curve, and increased competition in the subservicing market has benefited financial participants like us. 
 On the strategic front as it relates to MSR, our long history of formulating value-add partnerships was again on display this quarter as we announced a sub-servicing partnership with Rocket Mortgage Rocket in early October. Our size and the stability of our capital helped develop this relationship and we are pleased to be Rocket s first Agency MSR subservicing client. Rocket is expected to begin servicing loans for us as early as December, and this partnership should allow us to benefit from Rocket s recapture abilities and we expect it to increase our competitiveness in purchasing new MSR. Similar to our existing sub-servicing agreement, our Rocket agreement allows us to effectively participate in the gain on sale of a loan refinanced by our recapture partners, helping to preserve and protect our portfolio.

Economic Environment 
 U.S. real economic growth remained sound in the third quarter, as gross domestic product rose 2.8 on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate SAAR ), in line with average growth seen in the first half of this year. Measures of consumption indicate that rising real household incomes have led consumers to maintain spending power, with consumer spending rising 3.7 SAAR in the third quarter. However, consumers appear to be increasingly cautious as elevated short-term interest rates, low savings rates, a slowing labor market, and declining confidence appear to weigh on spending behavior going forward. Nonresidential investment activity appears to have been robust during the quarter, particularly in equipment and intangibles, though residential investment remains muted as the restrictive monetary policy and inclement weather have impacted housing construction. 
 The supply and demand for labor has continued to move into better balance. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, seasonally adjusted total non-farm payroll employment rose at a stronger rate than the prior quarter, with a monthly average 186,000 workers added in the third quarter compared to 177,000 workers in the second quarter. The unemployment rate ended the quarter at 4.1 after reaching 4.3 in July, the highest monthly reading since the fourth quarter of 2021, as more people entered the labor force, but ultimately were unable to find employment. At the same time, wage growth, as measured by the year-over-year change in average hourly earnings, rose to 4.0 in September compared to 3.8 in June. 
 Inflation readings, as measured by the year-over-year changes in the Personal Consumption Expenditure Chain Price Index PCE remain above the Fed s 2 inflation target and progress on disinflationary measures appears to have resumed following the firmer readings in the early part of the year. Total PCE prices over the 12 months ended in September fell to 2.1 compared to the 2.4 recorded by the same metric in June, while core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose slightly from 2.6 in June to 2.7 year-over-year in September. Price pressures eased in several services, including transportation and recreation services, as airline fares and live event pricing pressures continue to ease. Shelter inflation, one of the largest expenses for households and therefore the largest weight in the Consumer Price Index , continues to ease at an uneven pace, with monthly readings during the quarter showing an elevated degree of volatility. A further slowdown in aggregate inflation is likely to continue, particularly if shelter inflation eases further, as is widely expected.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 The Fed conducts monetary policy with a dual mandate: full employment and price stability. Given the significant progress in reducing inflation, participants of the FOMC judged that the risks to achieving their dual mandate were in balance and that it is appropriate to begin to ease the stance of policy. At the September FOMC meeting, the Committee reduced their target range for the federal funds rate to 4.75 5.0 and forecast a further 50 basis points in cuts through the end of the year. The FOMC concluded that recalibrating the stance of policy closer to their observed neutral rate would help sustain the strength of the economy while continuing to promote progress on inflation. Meanwhile, regarding the FOMC s balance sheet policy, the decline in their securities portfolio, which started in 2022, continued throughout the third quarter at a pace of 25 billion per month in Treasury securities and 35 billion per month in MBS. 
 Interest rate levels fell during the third quarter as market participants priced a downward shift in the Fed s policy rate path. The most pronounced shift occurred in short-term rates, leading the Treasury yield curve to steepen. Measures of interest rate volatility remained high as policy uncertainty in the near term rose notably. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate declined from 4.40 on June 30 to 3.78 on September 30, 2024. At the same time, the mortgage basis, or the spread between the 30-year Agency MBS coupon and 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, tightened from 147 basis points to 118 basis points over the same period.

 Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for additional information. 
 (1) GAAP leverage is computed as the sum of repurchase agreements, other secured financing, debt issued by securitization vehicles, participations issued and U.S. Treasury securities sold, not yet purchased divided by total equity. Economic leverage is computed as the sum of recourse debt, cost basis of to-be-announced TBA and CMBX derivatives outstanding, and net forward purchases (sales) of investments divided by total equity. Recourse debt consists of repurchase agreements, other secured financing, and U.S. Treasury securities sold, not yet purchased. Debt issued by securitization vehicles and participations issued are non-recourse to us and are excluded from economic leverage. 
 (2) GAAP capital ratio is computed as total equity divided by total assets. Economic capital ratio is computed as total equity divided by total economic assets. Total economic assets include the implied market value of TBA derivatives and net of debt issued by securitization vehicles. 
 (3) Annualized GAAP return (loss) on average equity annualizes realized and unrealized gains and (losses) which may not be indicative of full year performance, unannualized GAAP return (loss) on average equity is 0.69 , and (5.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 4.62 and (10.88 for the the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 (4) Net interest margin represents our interest income less interest expense divided by the average interest earning assets. Net interest margin does not include net interest component of interest rate swaps. Net interest margin (excluding PAA) represents the sum of our interest income (excluding PAA) plus TBA dollar roll income and CMBX coupo n income less economic interest expense divide d by the sum of average interest earning assets plus average outstanding TBA contract and CMBX balances. 
 (5) Average yield on interest earning assets represents annualized interest income divided by average interest earning assets. Average interest earning assets reflects the average amortized cost of our investments during the period. Average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA) is calculated using annualized interest income (excluding PAA). 
 (6) Average GAAP cost of interest bearing liabilities represents annualized interest expense divided by average interest bearing liabilities. Average interest bearing liabilities reflects the average balances during the period. Average economic cost of interest bearing liabilities represents annualized economic interest expense divided by average interest bearing liabilities. Economic interest expense is comprised of GAAP interest expense, the net interest component of interest rate swaps, and, beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2024, net interest on initial margin related to interest rate swaps, which is reported in Other, net in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Prior period results have not been adjusted in accordance with this change as the impact is not material. Net interest on variation margin related to interest rate swaps was previously and is currently included in the Net interest component of interest rate swaps in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented. 
 (7) Excludes dividends on preferred stock.

 Net income (loss) was 82.4 million, which includes 15.9 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, or 0.05 per average basic common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 569.1) million, which includes 6.9) million attributable to noncontrolling interests, or 1.21) per average basic common share, for the same period in 2023. We attribute the majority of the change in net income (loss) to favorable changes in net gains (losses) on investments and other, net interest income, and net servicing income, partially offset by an unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on derivatives. Net gains (losses) on investments and other was 1.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.7) billion for the same period in 2023. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.4 million compared to 45.3) million for the same period in 2023. Net servicing income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 109.6 million compared to 88.0 million for the same period in 2023. Net gains (losses) on derivatives was 1.8) billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.1 billion for the same period in 2023. 
 Net income (loss) was 538.7 million, which includes 18.8 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, or 0.80 per average basic common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.2) billion, which includes 7.8) million attributable to noncontrolling interests, or 2.73) per average basic common share, for the same period in 2023. We attribute the majority of the change in net income (loss) to favorable changes in net gains (losses) on investments and other, net interest income, and net servicing income, partially offset by an unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on derivatives. Net gains (losses) on investments and other was 160.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.0) billion for the same period in 2023. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 60.5 million compared to 57.8) million for the same period in 2023. Net servicing income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 320.4 million compared to 239.3 million for the same period in 2023. Net gains on derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 53.6 million compared to 2.7 billion for the same period in 2023. Refer to the section titled Other income (loss) located within this Item 2 for additional information related to these changes. 
 Non-GAAP 
 Earnings available for distribution were 382.5 million, or 0.66 per average common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 362.0 million, or 0.66 per average common share, for the same period in 2023. The change in earnings available for distribution during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher coupon income, resulting from higher residential mortgage loan and reverse repurchase agreement balances and purchasing securities higher up in the coupon stack, and higher net servicing income. This change was partially offset by higher interest expense from an increase in average borrowing rates and average interest bearing liabilities, and an unfavorable change in the net interest component of interest rate swaps. 
 Earnings available for distribution were 1.1 billion, or 1.98 per average common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.2 billion, or 2.18 per average common share, for the same period in 2023. The change in earnings available for distribution during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 primarily due to higher interest expense from an increase in average borrowing rates and average interest bearing liabilities and an unfavorable change in the net interest component of interest rate swaps. This change was partially offset by higher coupon income, resulting from increased residential mortgage loan balances, purchasing securities higher up in the coupon stack, lower premium amortization expense, excluding PAA, and higher net servicing income. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: 
 earnings available for distribution EAD 
 earnings available for distribution attributable to common stockholders; 
 earnings available for distribution per average common share; 
 annualized EAD return on average equity; 
 economic leverage; 
 economic capital ratio; 
 interest income (excluding PAA); 

economic interest expense; 
 economic net interest income (excluding PAA); 
 average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA); 
 average economic cost of interest bearing liabilities; 
 net interest margin (excluding PAA); and 
 net interest spread (excluding PAA). 

These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures computed in accordance with GAAP. While intended to offer a fuller understanding of our results and operations, non-GAAP financial measures also have limitations. For example, we may calculate our non-GAAP metrics, such as earnings available for distribution, or the PAA, differently than our peers making comparative analysis difficult. Additionally, in the case of non-GAAP measures that exclude the PAA, the amount of amortization expense excluding the PAA is not necessarily representative of the amount of future periodic amortization nor is it indicative of the term over which we will amortize the remaining unamortized premium. Changes to actual and estimated prepayments will impact the timing and amount of premium amortization and, as such, both GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
 These non-GAAP measures provide additional detail to enhance investor understanding of our period-over-period operating performance and business trends, as well as for assessing our performance versus that of industry peers. Additional information pertaining to our use of these non-GAAP financial measures, including discussion of how each such measure may be useful to investors, and reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP results are provided below.

 Our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and optimize our returns through prudent management of our diversified investment strategies. We generate net income by earning a net interest spread on our investment portfolio, which is a function of interest income from our investment portfolio less financing, hedging and operating costs. Earnings available for distribution, which is defined as the sum of (a) economic net interest income, (b) TBA dollar roll income and CMBX coupon income, (c) net servicing income less realized amortization of MSR, (d) other income (loss) (excluding amortization of intangibles, non-EAD income allocated to equity method investments and other non-EAD components of other income (loss)), (e) general and administrative expenses (excluding transaction expenses and non-recurring items), and (f) income taxes (excluding the income tax effect of non-EAD income (loss) items), and excludes (g) the PAA representing the cumulative impact on prior periods, but not the current period, of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term prepayment speeds related to our Agency mortgage-backed securities, is used by management and, we believe, used by analysts and investors to measure our progress in achieving our principal business objective. 
 We seek to fulfill our principal business objective through a variety of factors including portfolio construction, the degree of market risk exposure and related hedge profile, and the use and forms of leverage, all while operating within the parameters of our capital allocation policy and risk governance framework. 
 We believe these non-GAAP measures provide management and investors with additional details regarding our underlying operating results and investment portfolio trends by (i) making adjustments to account for the disparate reporting of changes in fair value where certain instruments are reflected in GAAP net income (loss) while others are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss), and (ii) by excluding certain unrealized, non-cash or episodic components of GAAP net income (loss) in order to

 provide additional transparency into the operating performance of our portfolio. In addition, EAD serves as a useful indicator for investors in evaluating our performance and ability to pay dividends. Annualized EAD return on average equity, which is calculated by dividing earnings available for distribution over average stockholders equity, provides investors with additional detail on the earnings available for distribution generated by our invested equity capital.

From time to time, we enter into TBA forward contracts as an alternate means of investing in and financing Agency MBS. A TBA contract is an agreement to purchase or sell, for future delivery, an Agency MBS with a specified issuer, term and coupon. A TBA dollar roll represents a transaction where TBA contracts with the same terms but different settlement dates are simultaneously bought and sold. The TBA contract settling in the later month typically prices at a discount to the earlier month contract with the difference in price commonly referred to as the drop . The drop is a reflection of the expected net interest income from an investment in similar Agency MBS, net of an implied financing cost, that would be foregone as a result of settling the contract in the later month rather than in the earlier month. The drop between the current settlement month price and the forward settlement month price occurs because in the TBA dollar roll market, the party providing the financing is the party that would retain all principal and interest payments accrued during the financing period. Accordingly, TBA dollar roll income generally represents the economic equivalent of the net interest income earned on the underlying Agency MBS less an implied financing cost. 
 44 

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 TBA dollar roll transactions are accounted for under GAAP as a series of derivatives transactions. The fair value of TBA derivatives is based on methods similar to those used to value Agency MBS. We record TBA derivatives at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and recognize periodic changes in fair value in Net gains (losses) on derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), which includes both unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives. 
 TBA dollar roll income is calculated as the difference in price between two TBA contracts with the same terms but different settlement dates multiplied by the notional amount of the TBA contract. Although accounted for as derivatives, TBA dollar rolls capture the economic equivalent of net interest income, or carry, on the underlying Agency MBS (interest income less an implied cost of financing). TBA dollar roll income is reported as a component of Net gains (losses) on derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 The CMBX index is a synthetic tradable index referencing a basket of 25 commercial mortgage-backed securities of a particular rating and vintage. The CMBX index allows investors to take a long position (referred to as selling protection) or short position (referred to as purchasing protection) on the respective basket of commercial mortgage-backed securities and is structured as a pay-as-you-go contract whereby the protection seller receives and the protection buyer pays a standardized running coupon on the contracted notional amount. Additionally, the protection seller is obligated to pay to the protection buyer the amount of principal losses and/or coupon shortfalls on the underlying commercial mortgage-backed securities as they occur. We report income (expense) on CMBX positions in Net gains (losses) on derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The coupon payments received or paid on CMBX positions is equivalent to interest income (expense) and therefore included in earnings available for distribution. 

Premium Amortization Expense 
 In accordance with GAAP, we amortize or accrete premiums or discounts into interest income for our Agency MBS, excluding interest-only securities, multifamily and reverse mortgages, taking into account estimates of future principal prepayments in the calculation of the effective yield. We recalculate the effective yield as differences between anticipated and actual prepayments occur. Using third party models and market information to project future cash flows and expected remaining lives of securities, the effective interest rate determined for each security is applied as if it had been in place from the date of the security s acquisition. The amortized cost of the security is then adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition date. The adjustment to amortized cost is offset with a charge or credit to interest income. Changes in interest rates and other market factors will impact prepayment speed projections and the amount of premium amortization recognized in any given period. 
 Our GAAP metrics include the unadjusted impact of amortization and accretion associated with this method. Certain of our non-GAAP metrics exclude the effect of the PAA, which quantifies the component of premium amortization representing the cumulative impact on prior periods, but not the current period, of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term Constant Prepayment Rate CPR ). 
 The following table illustrates the impact of the PAA on premium amortization expense for our Residential Securities portfolio for the periods presented:

Economic Leverage and Economic Capital Ratios 
 We use capital coupled with borrowed funds to invest primarily in real estate related investments, earning the spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities. Our capital structure is designed to offer an efficient complement of funding sources to generate positive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders while maintaining appropriate liquidity to support our business and meet our financial obligations under periods of market stress. To maintain our desired capital profile, we utilize a mix of debt and equity funding. Debt funding may include the use of repurchase agreements, loans, securitizations, participations issued, lines of credit, asset backed lending facilities, corporate bond issuance, convertible bonds or other liabilities. Equity capital primarily consists of common and preferred stock.

 Our economic leverage ratio is computed as the sum of recourse debt, cost basis of TBA derivatives outstanding, and net forward purchases (sales) of investments divided by total equity. Recourse debt consists of repurchase agreements, other secured financing, and U.S Treasury securities sold, not yet purchased. Debt issued by securitization vehicles and participations issued are non-recourse to us and are excluded from economic leverage.

Interest Income (excluding PAA), Economic Interest Expense and Economic Net Interest Income (excluding PAA) 
 Interest income (excluding PAA) represents interest income excluding the effect of the premium amortization adjustment, and serves as the basis for deriving average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA), net interest spread (excluding PAA) and net interest margin (excluding PAA), which are discussed below. We believe this measure provides management and investors with additional detail to enhance their understanding of our operating results and trends by excluding the component of premium amortization expense representing the cumulative effect of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term prepayment speeds related to our Agency MBS (other than interest-only securities, multifamily and reverse mortgages), which can obscure underlying trends in the performance of the portfolio.

 Economic interest expense is comprised of GAAP interest expense, the net interest component of interest rate swaps (which includes net interest on variation margin related to interest rate swaps) and net interest on initial margin related to interest rate swaps, which is reported in Other, net in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changing interest rates on repurchase agreements by economically hedging cash flows associated with these borrowings. Accordingly, adding the net interest component of interest rate swaps to interest expense, as computed in accordance with GAAP, reflects the total contractual interest expense and thus, provides investors with additional information about the cost of our financing strategy. We may use market agreed coupon MAC interest rate swaps in which we may receive or make a payment at the time of entering into such interest rate swap to compensate for the off-market nature of such interest rate swap. In accordance with GAAP, upfront payments associated with MAC interest rate swaps are not reflected in the net interest component of interest rate swaps, which is presented in Net gains (losses) on derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 Similarly, economic net interest income (excluding PAA), as computed below, provides investors with additional information to enhance their understanding of the net economics of our primary business operations.

Experienced and Projected Long-Term CPR 
 Prepayment speeds, as reflected by the CPR and interest rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. In general, as prepayment speeds and expectations of prepayment speeds on our Agency MBS portfolio increase, related purchase premium amortization increases, thereby reducing the yield on such assets. The following table presents the weighted average experienced CPR and weighted average projected long-term CPR on our Agency MBS portfolio as of and for the periods presented.

Economic interest expense increased by 230.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense on securitized debt and repurchase agreements reflecting higher borrowing rates and higher average interest bearing liabilities, as well as the reduction in the net interest component of interest rate swaps, which was 317.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 394.7 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Economic interest expense increased by 866.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense on securitized debt and repurchase agreements reflecting higher borrowing rates and higher average interest bearing liabilities as well as the reduction in the net interest component of interest rate swaps, which was 946.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.2 billion for the same period in 2023. 
 We do not manage our portfolio to have a pre-designated amount of borrowings at quarter or year end. Our borrowings at period end are a snapshot of our borrowings as of a date, and this number may differ from average borrowings over the period for a number of reasons. The mortgage-backed securities we own pay principal and interest towards the end of each month and the mortgage-backed securities we purchase are typically settled during the beginning of the month. As a result, depending on the amount of mortgage-backed securities we have committed to purchase, we may retain the principal and interest we receive in the prior month, or we may use it to pay down our borrowings. Moreover, we generally use interest rate swaps, swaptions and other derivative instruments to hedge our portfolio, and as we pledge or receive collateral under these agreements, our borrowings on any given day may be increased or decreased. Our average borrowings during a quarter may differ from period end borrowings as we implement our portfolio management strategies and risk management strategies over changing market conditions by increasing or decreasing leverage. Additionally, these numbers may differ during periods when we conduct equity capital raises, as in certain instances we may purchase additional assets and increase leverage in anticipation of an equity capital raise. Since our average borrowings and period end borrowings can be expected to differ, we believe our average borrowings during a period provide a more accurate representation of our exposure to the risks associated with leverage than our period end borrowings. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the majority of our debt represented repurchase agreements and other secured financing arrangements collateralized by a pledge of our Residential Securities, residential mortgage loans, and MSR. All of our Residential Securities are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings. However, we limit our borrowings, and thus our potential asset growth, in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and maintain the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet.

 (2) Other income (loss) excludes the net interest component of interest rate swaps. 

Unrealized Gains and Losses - Available-for-Sale Investments 
 The unrealized fluctuations in market values of our available-for-sale Agency MBS, for which the fair value option is not elected, do not impact our GAAP net income (loss) but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As a result of this fair value accounting treatment, our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used amortized cost accounting. As a result, comparisons with companies that use amortized cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful. 
 The following table shows cumulative unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investments reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Unrealized gain 6,142 5,051 Unrealized loss (718,345) (1,340,451) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (712,203) (1,335,400) 
 Unrealized changes in the estimated fair value of available-for-sale investments may have a direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends: positive changes will increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes tend to reduce borrowing capacity. A very large negative change in the net fair value of our available-for-sale Residential Securities might impair our liquidity position, requiring us to sell assets with the potential result of realized losses upon sale. 
 The fair value of these securities being less than amortized cost at September 30, 2024 is solely due to market conditions and not the quality of the assets. Substantially all of the Agency MBS have an actual or implied credit rating that is the same as that of the U.S. government. The investments do not require an allowance for credit losses because we currently have the ability and intent to hold the investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of the amortized cost bases, which may be maturity. Also, we are guaranteed payment of the principal and interest amounts of the securities by the respective issuing Agency. 

Financial Condition 
 Total assets were 101.5 billion and 93.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to increases in securitized residential whole loans of consolidated VIEs of 7.7 billion, securities of 2.1 billion, mortgage servicing rights of 570.9 million, and cash and cash equivalents of 148.0 million, partially offset by decreases in

Residential Securities 
 Substantially all of our Agency MBS at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were backed by single-family residential mortgage loans and were secured with a first lien position on the underlying single-family properties. Our mortgage-backed securities were largely Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae pass through certificates or CMOs, which have an actual or implied credit rating that is the same as that of the U.S. government. We carry all of our Agency MBS at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 We accrete discount balances as an increase to interest income over the expected life of the related interest earning assets and we amortize premium balances as a decrease to interest income over the expected life of the related interest earning assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition a total of 1.3 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively, of unamortized discount (which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current amortized cost of our Residential Securities acquired at a price below principal value) and a total of 2.4 billion and 2.4 billion, respectively, of unamortized premium (which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current amortized cost of our Residential Securities acquired at a price above principal value). 
 The weighted average experienced prepayment speed on our Agency MBS portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7.6 and 7.3 , respectively. The weighted average projected long-term prepayment speed on our Agency MBS portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11.9 and 7.1 , respectively. 
 Given our current portfolio composition, if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage-backed securities, all other factors being equal, our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage-backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period. Similarly, if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage-backed securities, all other factors being equal, our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage-backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 In the coming periods, we expect to continue to finance our Residential Securities in a manner that is largely consistent with our current operations via repurchase agreements. We may use securitization structures, credit facilities, or other term financing structures to finance certain of our assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 4.9 billion from principal repayments and 17.3 billion in cash from disposal of Securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 4.7 billion from principal repayments and 18.7 billion in cash from disposal of Securities. 
 
 Commitments and Contractual Obligations with Unconsolidated Entities 
 We do not have any commitments or contractual obligations arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources. 

Capital Management 

Maintaining a strong balance sheet that can support the business even in times of economic stress and market volatility is of critical importance to our business strategy. A strong and robust capital position is essential to executing our investment strategy. Our capital strategy is predicated on a strong capital position, which enables us to execute our investment strategy regardless of the market environment. Our capital policy defines the parameters and principles supporting a comprehensive capital management practice. 
 The major risks impacting capital are liquidity and funding risk, investment/market risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, operational risk and compliance, regulatory and legal risk. For further discussion of the risks we are subject to, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Capital requirements are based on maintaining levels above approved thresholds, ensuring the quality of our capital appropriately reflects our asset mix, market and funding structure. In the event we fall short of our internal thresholds, we will consider appropriate actions which may include asset sales, changes in asset mix, reductions in asset purchases or originations, issuance of capital or other capital enhancing or risk reduction strategies.

 common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 1.5 billion, from time to time through any of the Prior Sales Agents (the Prior At-the-Market Sales Program ). 
 On September 20, 2024, we entered into new Distribution Agency Agreements (collectively, the Sales Agreements with each of Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, J.P.

Under the terms of the Sales Agreements, we may offer and sell shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 1.5 billion, from time to time through any of the Sales Agents (the "Current At-the-Market Sales Program" and, together with the Prior At-the-Market Sales Program, the "at-the-market sales program"). 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, under the at-the-market sales program, we issued 57.0 million and 57.6 million shares for proceeds of 1.1 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively, each net of commissions and fees. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, under the at-the-market sales program, we issued 0.9 million and 26.2 million shares for proceeds of 17.8 million and 580.5 million, respectively, each net of commissions and fees. Refer to the Capital Stock Note located within Item 1 for additional information related to the at-the-market sales program. 
 Preferred Stock 
 On November 3, 2022, our Board approved a repurchase plan for all of our existing outstanding Preferred Stock (as defined below, the Preferred Stock Repurchase Program ). Under the terms of the plan, we are authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of 63,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, comprised of up to (i) 28,800,000 shares of our 6.95 Series F Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Series F Preferred Stock ), (ii) 17,000,000 shares of our 6.50 Series G Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Series G Preferred Stock ), and (iii) 17,700,000 shares of our 6.75 Series I Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Series I Preferred Stock , and together with Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock ). The aggregate liquidation value of the Preferred Stock that may be repurchased by us pursuant to the Preferred Stock Repurchase Program, as of November 3, 2022, was approximately 1.6 billion. The Preferred Stock Repurchase Program became effective on November 3, 2022, and shall expire on December 31, 2024. No shares were repurchased with respect to the Preferred Stock Repurchase Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Purchases made pursuant to the Preferred Stock Repurchase Program will be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us in our discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Preferred Stock and the program may be suspended or discontinued at our discretion without prior notice. 

Leverage and Capital 
 We believe that it is prudent to maintain conservative GAAP leverage ratios and economic leverage ratios as there may be continued volatility in the mortgage and credit markets. Our capital policy governs our capital and leverage position including setting limits. Based on the guidelines, we generally expect to maintain an economic leverage ratio of less than 10:1. Our actual economic leverage ratio varies from time to time based upon various factors, including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities, our liquidity position, our level of unused borrowing capacity, the availability of credit, over-collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings and our assessment of domestic and international market conditions. 
 Our GAAP leverage ratio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 6.9:1 and 6.8:1, respectively. Our economic leverage ratio, which is computed as the sum of Recourse Debt, cost basis of TBA derivatives outstanding, and net forward purchases (sales) of investments divided by total equity was 5.7:1 and 5.7:1, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our GAAP capital ratio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 12.4 and 12.2 , respectively. Our economic capital ratio, which represents our ratio of stockholders equity to total economic assets (inclusive of the implied market value of TBA derivatives and net of debt issued by securitization vehicles), was 14.6 and 14.0 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Economic leverage ratio and economic capital ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for additional information, including reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP results.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Risk Management 
 We are subject to a variety of risks in the ordinary conduct of our business. The effective management of these risks is of critical importance to the overall success of Annaly. The objective of our risk management framework is to identify, measure and monitor these risks. 
 Our risk management framework is intended to facilitate a holistic, enterprise-wide view of risk. We believe we have built a strong and collaborative risk management culture throughout Annaly focused on awareness which supports appropriate understanding and management of our key risks. Each employee is accountable for identifying, monitoring and managing risk within their area of responsibility. 

Risk Appetite 
 We maintain a firm-wide risk appetite statement which defines the types and levels of risk we are willing to take in order to achieve our business objectives, and reflects our risk management philosophy. We engage in risk activities based on our core expertise that aim to enhance value for our stockholders. Our activities focus on income generation and capital preservation through proactive portfolio management, supported by a conservative liquidity and leverage posture. 
 The risk appetite statement asserts the following key risk parameters to guide our investment management activities: 
 Risk Parameter Description Portfolio Composition We will maintain a portfolio comprised of target assets approved by our Board and in accordance with our capital allocation policy. Leverage We generally expect to maintain an economic leverage ratio no greater than 10:1 considerate of our overall capital allocation framework. Liquidity Risk We will seek to maintain an unencumbered asset portfolio sufficient to meet our liquidity needs under adverse market conditions. Interest Rate Risk We will seek to manage interest rate risk to protect the portfolio from adverse rate movements utilizing derivative instruments targeting both income and capital preservation. Credit Risk We will seek to manage credit risk by making investments which conform to our specific investment policy parameters and optimize risk-adjusted returns. Capital Preservation We will seek to protect our capital base through disciplined risk management practices. Operational Risk We will seek to limit impacts to our business through disciplined operational risk management practices addressing areas including but not limited to, management of key third party relationships (i.e. originators, sub-servicers), human capital management, cybersecurity and technology related matters, business continuity and financial reporting risk. Compliance, Regulatory and Legal We will seek to comply with regulatory requirements needed to maintain our REIT status and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act and the licenses and approvals of our regulated and licensed subsidiaries. 

Governance 
 Risk management begins with our Board, through the review and oversight of the risk management framework, and executive management, through the ongoing formulation of risk management practices and related execution in managing risk. The Board exercises its oversight of risk management primarily through the Risk Committee and Audit Committee with support from the other Board Committees. The Risk Committee is responsible for oversight of our risk governance structure, risk management (operational and market risk) and risk assessment guidelines and policies and our risk appetite. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of our accounting, internal controls and financial reporting practices, including independent auditor selection, evaluation and review, and oversight of the internal audit function. The Risk Committee and the Audit Committee jointly oversee practices and policies related to cybersecurity and receive regular reports from management throughout the year on cybersecurity and related risks. The Management Development and Compensation Committee is responsible for oversight of risk related to our compensation policies and practices and other human capital matters such as succession and culture. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of our corporate governance framework and the annual self-evaluation of the Board, and the Corporate Responsibility Committee assists the Board in its oversight of any matters that may present reputational or environmental, social, and governance ESG risk to us. The full Board has overall responsibility for ESG oversight, and the Corporate Responsibility Committee meets jointly with other Committees from time to time in order to review areas of shared responsibility.

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Risk assessment and risk management are the responsibility of our management. A series of management committees has oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Membership of these committees is reviewed regularly to ensure the appropriate personnel are engaged in the risk management process. Three primary management committees have been established to provide a comprehensive framework for risk management. The management committees responsible for our risk management include the Enterprise Risk Committee ERC ), Asset / Liability Committee ALCO and the Financial Reporting and Disclosure Committee FRDC ). Each of these committees reports to our management Operating Committee, which is responsible for oversight and management of our operations, including oversight and approval authority over all aspects of our enterprise risk management. 
 Audit Services is an independent function with reporting lines to the Audit Committee. Audit Services is responsible for performing our internal audit activities, which includes independently assessing and validating key controls within the risk management framework. 
 Our compliance group is responsible for oversight of our regulatory compliance. Our Chief Compliance Officer has reporting lines to the Audit Committee. 
 
 Description of Risks 
 We are subject to a variety of risks due to the business we operate. Risk categories are an important component of a robust enterprise-wide risk management framework. 
 We have identified the following primary categories that we utilize to identify, assess, measure and monitor risk. 
 Risk Description Liquidity and Funding Risk Risk to earnings, capital or business resulting from our inability to meet our obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses because of inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. Investment/Market Risk Risk to earnings, capital or business resulting in the decline in value of our assets or an increase in the costs of financing caused by changes in market variables, such as interest rates, which affect the values of investment securities and other investment instruments. Credit Risk Risk to earnings, capital or business resulting from an obligor s failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise failure to perform as agreed. This risk is present in lending and investing activities. Counterparty Risk Risk to earnings, capital or business resulting from a counterparty s failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise failure to perform as agreed. This risk is present in funding, hedging and investing activities. Operational Risk Risk to earnings, capital, reputation or business arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems (including business continuity planning), human factors or external events. This risk also applies to our use of proprietary and third party models, software vendors and data providers, and oversight of third party service providers such as sub-servicers, due diligence firms etc. Compliance, Regulatory and Legal Risk Risk to earnings, capital, reputation or conduct of business arising from violations of, or nonconformance with internal and external applicable rules and regulations, losses resulting from lawsuits or adverse judgments, or from changes in the regulatory environment that may impact our business model. 

Liquidity and Funding Risk Management 
 Our liquidity and funding risk management strategy is designed to ensure the availability of sufficient resources to support our business and meet our financial obligations under both normal and adverse market and business environments. Our liquidity and funding risk management practices consist of the following primary elements: 
 Element Description Funding Availability of diverse and stable sources of funds. Excess Liquidity Excess liquidity primarily in the form of unencumbered assets and cash. Maturity Profile Diversity and tenor of liabilities and modest use of leverage. Stress Testing Scenario modeling to measure the resiliency of our liquidity position. Liquidity Management Policies Comprehensive policies including monitoring, risk limits and an escalation protocol. 

Funding 
 Our primary financing sources are repurchase agreements provided through counterparty arrangements and through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Arcola Securities, Inc. Arcola ), other secured financing, debt issued by securitization vehicles, mortgages, 
 59 

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 credit facilities, note sales and various forms of equity. We maintain excess liquidity by holding unencumbered liquid assets that could be either used to collateralize additional borrowings or sold. 
 We seek to conservatively manage our repurchase agreement funding position through a variety of methods including diversity, breadth and depth of counterparties and maintaining a staggered maturity profile. 
 Arcola provides direct access to third party funding as a FINRA member broker-dealer. Arcola borrows funds through the General Collateral Finance Repo service offered by the FICC, with FICC acting as the central counterparty. In addition, Arcola may borrow funds through direct repurchase agreements. 
 To reduce our liquidity risk we maintain a laddered approach to our repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average days to maturity was 34 days and 44 days, respectively. 
 Our repurchase agreements generally provide that in the event of a margin call we must provide additional securities or cash on the same business day that a margin call is made. Should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our Agency and Residential mortgage-backed securities and/or market interest rates or other factors move suddenly and cause declines in the market value of assets posted as collateral, resulting margin calls may cause an adverse change in our liquidity position. We have continued to diversify our financing profile adding new non-mark-to-market facilities and financing options under existing facilities for our Residential Credit operating segment. The non-mark-to-market facilities have margin call features that adjust on factors other than the changes in the market value of pledged collateral. We remain active and flexible in our liquidity structure. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had total financial assets and cash pledged against existing liabilities of 68.7 billion. The weighted average haircut was approximately 3 on repurchase agreements. The quality and character of the Residential Securities that we pledge as collateral under the repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps did not materially change at September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and our counterparties did not materially alter any requirements, including required haircuts, related to the col lateral we pledge under repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following table presents our quarterly average and quarter-end repurchase agreement and reverse repurchase agreement balances outstanding for the periods presented: 
 Repurchase Agreements Reverse Repurchase Agreements Average Daily Amount Outstanding Ending Amount Outstanding Average Daily Amount Outstanding Ending Amount Outstanding For the three months ended (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 67,092,629 64,310,276 3,041,120 June 30, 2024 63,043,218 60,787,994 2,322,479 March 31, 2024 64,027,388 58,975,232 2,323,485 December 31, 2023 61,924,576 62,201,543 1,340,204 September 30, 2023 66,020,036 64,693,821 257,097 June 30, 2023 64,591,463 61,637,600 600,968 March 31, 2023 60,477,833 60,993,018 371,429 December 31, 2022 59,946,810 59,512,597 102,025 September 30, 2022 56,354,310 54,160,731 139,991 
 Our committed facility warehouse lines provide financing for our MSR portfolio for liquidity purposes. We maintain a conservative approach to these facilities, generally over-collateralizing the lines against margin calls. 
 The following table provides information on our repurchase agreements and other secured financing by maturity date at September 30, 2024. The weighted average remaining maturity on our repurchase agreements and other secured financing was 36 days at September 30, 2024:

 We also finance our investments in residential mortgage loans through the issuance of securitization transactions sponsored by our wholly-owned subsidiary Onslow Bay Financial LLC Onslow Bay under the Onslow Bay private-label securitization program. In order to increase financing optionality for our Onslow Bay platform we closed a new warehouse facility and expanded an existing facility. Both facilities include expanded product offerings with a committed component for residential whole loans.

Excess Liquidity 
 Our primary source of liquidity is the availability of unencumbered assets which may be provided as collateral to support additional funding needs. We target minimum thresholds of available, unencumbered assets to maintain excess liquidity. The following table illustrates our asset portfolio available to support potential collateral obligations and funding needs. 
 Assets are considered encumbered if pledged as collateral against an existing liability, and therefore are no longer available to support additional funding. An asset is considered unencumbered if it has not been pledged or securitized. The following table also provides the carrying amount of our encumbered and unencumbered financial assets at September 30, 2024:

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 We maintain liquid assets in order to satisfy our current and future obligations in normal and stressed operating environments. These are held as the primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. The composition of our liquid assets is also considered and is subject to certain parameters. The composition is monitored for concentration risk, including in respect of our deposits of our cash and cash equivalents, and asset type. We believe the assets we consider liquid can be readily converted into cash, through liquidation or by being used as collateral in financing arrangements (including as additional collateral to support existing financial arrangements). Our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on-going basis through mortgage principal and interest repayments and net earnings held prior to payment of dividends. The following table presents our liquid assets as a percentage of total assets at September 30, 2024: 
 Carrying Value (1) 
 Liquid assets (dollars in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 1,560,159 Residential Securities (2)

The assets listed in this table include 68.7 billion of assets that have been pledged as collateral against existing liabilities at September 30, 2024. Please refer to the Encumbered and Unencumbered Assets table for related information. 
 (2) The amounts reflected in the table above are on a settlement date basis and may differ from the total positions reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 (3) Excludes securitized residential mortgage loans transferred or pledged to consolidated VIEs carried at fair value of 21.0 billion. 
 (4) Denominator is computed based on the carrying amount of encumbered and unencumbered financial assets, excluding assets transferred or pledged to securitization vehicles, of 21.1 billion. 

Maturity Profile 
 We consider the profile of our assets, liabilities and derivatives when managing both liquidity risk as well as investment/market risk employing a measurement of both the maturity gap and interest rate sensitivity gap. We determine the amount of liquid assets that are required to be held by monitoring several liquidity metrics. We utilize several modeling techniques to analyze our current and potential obligations including the expected cash flows from our assets, liabilities and derivatives. The following table illustrates the expected final maturities and cash flows of our assets, liabilities and derivatives. The table is based on a static portfolio and assumes no reinvestment of asset cash flows and no future liabilities are entered into. In assessing the maturity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet obligations, we use the stated maturities, or our prepayment expectations for assets and liabilities that exhibit prepayment characteristics. Cash and cash equivalents are included in the Less than 3 Months maturity bucket, as they are typically held for a short period of time. 
 With respect to each maturity bucket, our maturity gap is considered negative when the amount of maturing liabilities exceeds the amount of maturing assets. A negative gap increases our liquidity risk as we must enter into future liabilities. 
 Our interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or re-pricing within a given time period. Unlike the calculation of maturity gap, interest rate sensitivity gap includes the effect of our interest rate swaps. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest-rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest-rate sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely. Because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions, changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if assets and liabilities were perfectly matched in each maturity category. The amount of assets and liabilities utilized to compute our interest rate sensitivity gap was determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities, except that adjustable-rate loans and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature. The effects of interest rate swaps, whereby we generally pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate and effectively lock in our financing costs for a longer term, are also reflected in our interest rate sensitivity gap. 
 The interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the following table at September 30, 2024 could vary substantially based on actual prepayment experience.

 The methodologies we employ for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate gap, measurement of the duration and convexity of our portfolio and sensitivities to interest rates and spreads. 

Stress Testing 
 We utilize liquidity stress testing to ensure we have sufficient liquidity under a variety of scenarios and stresses. These stress tests assist with the management of our pool of liquid assets and influence our current and future funding plans. The stresses applied include market-wide and firm-specific stresses. 

Liquidity Management Policies 
 We utilize a comprehensive liquidity policy structure to inform our liquidity risk management practices including monitoring and measurement, along with well-defined key risk indicators. Both quantitative and qualitative targets are utilized to measure the ongoing stability and condition of the liquidity position, and include the level and composition of unencumbered assets, as well as the sustainability of the funding composition under stress conditions. 
 We also monitor early warning metrics designed to measure the quality and depth of liquidity sources based upon both company-specific and market conditions. The metrics assist in assessing our liquidity conditions and are integrated into our escalation protocol.

 Investment/Market Risk Management 
 One of the primary risks we are subject to is investment/market risk. Changes in the level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the income we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred from interest bearing liabilities and derivatives. Changes in the level of interest rates and spreads can also affect the value of our assets and potential realization of gains or losses from the sale of these assets. We may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, options, futures and other hedges, in order to limit the adverse effects of interest rates on our results. In the case of interest rate swaps, we utilize contracts linked to SOFR but may also enter into interest rate swaps where the floating leg is linked to the overnight index swap rate or another index. In addition, we may use MAC interest rate swaps in which we may receive or make a payment at the time of entering such interest rate swap to compensate for the off-market nature of such interest rate swap. MAC interest rate swaps offer price transparency, flexibility and more efficient portfolio administration through compression which is the process of reducing the number of unique interest rate swap contracts and replacing them with fewer contracts containing market defined terms. Our portfolio and the value of our portfolio, including derivatives, may be adversely affected as a result of changing interest rates and spreads. 
 We simulate a wide variety of interest rate scenarios in evaluating our risk. Scenarios are run to capture our sensitivity to changes in interest rates, spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also consider the assumptions affecting our analysis such as those related to prepayments. In addition to predefined interest rate scenarios, we utilize Value-at-Risk measures to estimate potential losses in the portfolio over various time horizons utilizing various confidence levels. The following tables estimate the potential changes in economic net interest income over a twelve month period and the immediate effect on our portfolio market value (inclusive of derivative instruments), should interest rates instantaneously increase or decrease by 25, 50 or 75 basis points, and the effect of portfolio market value if mortgage option-adjusted spreads instantaneously increase or decrease by 5, 15 or 25 basis points (assuming shocks are parallel and instantaneous). All changes to income and portfolio market value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario. The net interest income simulations incorporate the interest expense effect of rate resets on liabilities and derivatives as well as the amortization expense and reinvestment of principal based on the prepayments on our securities, which varies based on the level of rates. The results assume no management actions in response to the rate or spread changes. The following table presents estimates at September 30, 2024. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Economic net interest income includes the net interest component of interest rate swaps and net interest on initial margin related to interest rate swaps, which is reported in Other, net in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 

Credit Risk Management 
 Key risk parameters have been established to specify our credit risk appetite. We seek to manage credit risk by making investments which conform to the firm s specific investment policy parameters and optimize risk-return attributes. 
 While we do not expect to encounter credit risk in our Agency mortgage-backed securities, we face credit risk on the non-Agency mortgage-backed securities and CRT securities in our portfolio. In addition, we are also exposed to credit risk on residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate investments. MSR values may also be impacted through reduced

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 servicing fees and higher costs to service the underlying mortgage loans due to borrower performance. Generally, we are subject to risk of loss if an issuer or borrower fails to perform its contractual obligations. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk, including establishing and reviewing limits for credit exposure. In the case of residential mortgage loans and MSR, we may engage a third party to perform due diligence on a sample of loans that we believe sufficiently represents the entire pool. Once an investment is made, our ongoing surveillance process includes regular reviews, analysis and oversight of investments by our investment personnel and appropriate committee. We review credit and other risks of loss associated with each investment. Our management monitors the overall portfolio risk and determines estimates of provision for loss. Additionally, ALCO has oversight of our credit risk exposure. 
 Our portfolio composition, based on balance sheet values, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Category Agency mortgage-backed securities 70.7 75.9 Credit risk transfer securities 0.8 1.1 Non-agency mortgage-backed securities 1.7 2.4 Residential mortgage loans (1) 
 23.9 17.9 Mortgage servicing rights 2.8 2.4 Commercial real estate 0.1 0.3 (1) Includes assets transferred or pledged to securitization vehicles. 

Counterparty Risk Management 
 Our use of repurchase and derivative agreements and trading activities create exposure to counterparty risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. In the event of default by a counterparty, we could have difficulty obtaining our assets pledged as collateral. A significant portion of our investments are financed with repurchase agreements by pledging our Residential Securities as collateral to the applicable lender. The collateral we pledge generally exceeds the amount of the borrowings under each agreement. If the counterparty to the repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and we are not able to recover our pledged asset, we are at risk of losing the over-collateralization or haircut. The amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral. 
 We also use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Under these agreements, we pledge securities and cash as collateral or settle variation margin payments as part of a margin arrangement. 
 If a counterparty were to default on its obligations, we would be exposed to a loss to a derivative counterparty to the extent that the amount of our securities or cash pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated derivative and we were not able to recover the excess collateral. Additionally, we would be exposed to a loss to a derivative counterparty to the extent that our unrealized gains on derivative instruments exceeded the amount of the counterparty s securities or cash pledged to us. 
 We monitor our exposure to counterparties across several dimensions including by type of arrangement, collateral type, counterparty type, ratings and geography. Additionally, ALCO has oversight of our counterparty exposure. The following table summarizes our exposure to counterparties by geography at September 30, 2024:

 Operational Risk Management 
 We are subject to operational risk in each of our business and support functions. Operational risk may arise from internal or external sources including human error, fraud, systems issues, process change, vendors, business interruptions and other external events. We manage operational risk through a variety of tools including processes, policies and procedures that cover topics such as business continuity, personal conduct, cybersecurity and vendor management. Other tools include Risk and Control Self Assessment RCSA testing, including disaster recovery/testing; systems controls, including access controls; training, including phishing exercises and cybersecurity awareness training; and monitoring, which includes the use of key risk indicators. Our Operational Risk Management team conducts a disaster recovery exercise on an annual basis and periodically conducts other operational risk tabletop exercises. Employee-level lines of defense against operational risk include proper segregation of incompatible duties, activity-level internal controls over financial reporting, the empowerment of business units to identify and mitigate operational risk sources, testing by our internal audit staff, and our overall governance framework. 
 Operational Risk Management responsibilities are overseen by the ERC. The ERC is responsible for supporting the Operating Committee in the implementation, ongoing monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the enterprise-wide risk management framework. This oversight authority includes review of the strategies, processes, policies, and practices established by management to identify, assess, measure, and manage enterprise-wide risk. 
 Cybersecurity is part of our enterprise-wide risk management framework. Processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks include cybersecurity risk assessments, use of key risk indicators, vendor cybersecurity risk management, employee training, including phishing exercises and cybersecurity awareness training, penetration testing, evaluation of cybersecurity insurance and periodic engagements by our internal audit department, which determines whether our cybersecurity program and information security practices align with relevant parts of the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST framework. We periodically engage penetration testing companies and law firms to assist in these processes. When we do so, we hire reputable companies, limit their access to only information necessary for the specific purpose and maintain security controls around confidential information, including personally identifiable information. We also maintain a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan Response Plan with processes to identify, contain, mitigate and escalate cybersecurity incidents, utilizing cross-functional expertise and external resources as needed. We conduct periodic tabletop exercises to test our Response Plan and our reaction to various business disruption events, and the results of these tabletop exercises are reported to the Cybersecurity Committee and the ERC. 
 We also have processes in place to oversee and identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third party service providers upon which we depend on to perform various business processes related to our operations, including mortgage loan servicers and sub-servicers. Our vendor management policy establishes procedures for engaging, onboarding and monitoring the performance of third party vendors. For mortgage loan servicers and sub-servicers, these procedures include assessing a vendor s financial health as well as oversight of its compliance with applicable laws and regulations, cybersecurity and business continuity programs and security of personally identifiable information. We also have processes to evaluate and classify cybersecurity risk related to sensitive data held by key third party service providers on their systems. 
 The Cybersecurity Committee has primary responsibility for these processes to manage cybersecurity risks, under the oversight of the ERC. Daily monitoring of cybersecurity defenses is performed by the IT Infrastructure Team and any issues are escalated to the Cybersecurity Committee as needed. The Cybersecurity Committee regularly meets to discuss both routine oversight of cybersecurity processes, policies and procedures and management of any cyber-specific events, including escalation to the ERC, the executive leadership team and/or the Board, as appropriate. 
 The Cybersecurity Committee includes representatives from Operational Risk Management, Information Technology, Legal, Mortgage Operations and Internal Controls. Certain members of the Cybersecurity Committee have relevant qualifications such as extensive work experience implementing data security measures, developing cybersecurity policies and procedures and assessing, managing and reporting cybersecurity risk. Members also participate in cybersecurity-related professional organizations that discuss industry threats, challenges and solutions to cybersecurity issues. Our Head of IT Infrastructure has completed the Cybersecurity: Managing Risk in the Information Age certificate program from Harvard University. 
 The Cybersecurity Committee regularly discusses cybersecurity risk management and best practices with the ERC and with the Audit and Risk Committees of our Board. The Audit and Risk Committees jointly oversee processes, practices and policies related to cybersecurity and receive joint and individual presentations from management and external experts on cyber-technology-related risks. Two members of our Board have completed the Carnegie Mellon/NACD Cyber-Risk Oversight Program and earned the CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight and one member of our Board has completed the NACD Master Class: Cyber-Risk Oversight Program. 
 To date, we have not detected any risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected us. However, even though we take steps to employ reasonable cybersecurity efforts, not every cybersecurity incident can be prevented or detected. We also may be held responsible for cybersecurity threats affecting our third party service providers, including servicers and sub-

 servicers. Therefore, while we believe there are currently no risks from any potential threat or cybersecurity incident that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, the likelihood or severity of such risks are difficult to predict. For further discussion, please see the risk factors titled We are highly dependent on information systems and networks, many of which are operated by third parties, and any failure of these systems or networks could materially and adversely affect our business and Cyberattacks or other information security breaches could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Compliance, Regulatory and Legal Risk Management 
 Our business is organized as a REIT, and we seek to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. The determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances. Accordingly, we closely monitor our REIT status within our risk management program. We also regularly assess our risk management in respect of our regulated and licensed subsidiaries, which include our registered broker-dealer subsidiary Arcola, our subsidiary that is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act and our subsidiary that operates as a licensed mortgage aggregator and master servicer. 
 The financial services industry is highly regulated and receives significant attention from regulators, which may impact both our company and our business strategy. Our investments in residential whole loans and MSR require us to comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations and maintain appropriate governmental licenses, approvals and exemptions. We proactively monitor the potential impact regulation may have both directly and indirectly on us. We maintain a process to actively monitor both actual and potential legal action that may affect us. Our risk management framework is designed to identify, measure and monitor these risks under oversight of the ERC. 
 We currently rely on the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, and we seek to continue to meet the requirements for this exemption from registration. The determination that we qualify for this exemption from registration depends on various factual matters and circumstances. Accordingly, in conjunction with our legal department, we closely monitor our compliance with Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act within our risk management program. Compliance with Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act is monitored by the FRDC. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies that require us to make significant judgments or estimates are described below. For more information on these critical accounting policies and other significant accounting policies, refer to the Note titled Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Valuation of Financial Instruments 

Residential Securities 
 Description: We carry Residential Securities at estimated fair value. There is an active market for our Agency mortgage-backed securities, CRT securities and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties: Since we primarily invest in securities that can be valued using quoted prices for actively traded assets, there is a high degree of observable inputs and less subjectivity in measuring fair value. Internal fair values are determined using quoted prices from the TBA securities market, the Treasury curve and the underlying characteristics of the individual securities, which may include coupon, periodic and life caps, reset dates and the expected life of the security. While prepayment rates may be difficult to predict and require estimation and judgment in the valuation of Agency mortgage-backed securities, we use several third party models to validate prepayment speeds used in fair value measurements of Residential Securities. All internal fair values are compared to external pricing sources and/or dealer quotes to determine reasonableness. Additionally, securities used as collateral for repurchase agreements are priced daily by counterparties to ensure sufficient collateralization, providing additional verification of our internal pricing. 
 67 

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Sensitivity of Estimates to Change: Changes in underlying assumptions used in estimating fair value impact the carrying value of the Residential securities as well as their yield. For example, an increase in CPR would decrease the carrying value and yield of our Agency mortgage-backed securities. Our valuations are most sensitive to changes in interest rate, which also impacts prepayment speeds. Refer to the Experienced and Projected Long-Term CPR, Financial Condition Residential Securities and the interest rate sensitivity and interest rate and MBS spread shock analysis and discussions within this Item 2 for further information. 

Residential Mortgage Loans 
 Description: We elected to account for Residential Mortgage Loans at fair value. There is an active market for the residential whole loans in which we invest. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties: Since we primarily invest in residential loans that can be valued using actively quoted prices for similar assets, there are observable inputs in measuring fair value. Internal fair values are determined using quoted prices for similar market transactions, the swap curve and the underlying characteristics of the individual loans, which may include loan term, coupon, and reset dates. While prepayment rates may be difficult to predict and are a significant estimate requiring judgment in the valuation of residential whole loans, we validate prepayment speeds against those provided by independent pricing analytic providers specializing in residential mortgage loans. Internal fair values are generally compared to external pricing sources to determine reasonableness. 
 Sensitivity of Estimates to Change: Changes to model assumptions, including prepayment speeds may significantly impact the fair value estimate of residential mortgage loans as well as unrealized gains and losses and yield on these assets. Our valuations are most sensitive to changes in interest rate, which also impacts prepayment speeds. Refer to the interest rate sensitivity and interest rate shock analysis and discussions within this Item 2 for further information. 

MSR 
 Description: We elected to account for MSR at fair value. The market for MSR is considered less active and transparent compared to securities. As such fair value estimates for our investment in MSR are obtained from models, which use significant unobservable inputs in their valuations. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties: These valuations primarily utilize discounted cash flow models that incorporate unobservable market data inputs including prepayment rates, delinquency levels, costs to service and discount rates. Model valuations are then compared to valuations obtained from third party pricing providers. Management reviews the valuations received from third party pricing providers and uses them as a point of comparison to modeled values. The valuation of MSR requires significant judgment by management and the third party pricing providers. 
 Sensitivity of Estimates to Change: Changes in the underlying assumptions used to estimate the fair value of MSR impact the carrying value as well as the related unrealized gains and losses recognized. For further discussion of the sensitivity of the model inputs refer to the Note titled Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Interest Rate Swaps 
 Description: We are required to account for derivative assets and liabilities at fair value, which may or may not be cleared through a derivative clearing organization. We value our cleared interest rate swaps using the prices provided by the derivatives clearing organization. We value uncleared derivatives using internal models with prices compared to counterparty marks. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties: We use the overnight indexed swap OIS curve, the SOFR curve, or SOFR forward rates as an input to value substantially all of our uncleared interest rate swaps. Consistent with market practice, we exchange collateral (also called margin) based on the fair values of our interest rate swaps. Through this margining process, we may be able to compare our recorded fair value with the fair value calculated by the counterparty or derivatives clearing organization, providing additional verification of our recorded fair value of the uncleared interest rate swaps. 
 Sensitivity of Estimates to Change: Changes in the OIS curve will impact the carrying value of our interest rate swap assets and liabilities. Our valuations are most sensitive to changes in interest rate, which also impacts prepayment speeds. Refer to the interest rate sensitivity and interest rate shock analysis and discussions within this Item 2 for further information. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 68 

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Description: Interest income from coupon payments is accrued based on the outstanding principal amounts of the Residential Securities and their contractual terms. Premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the Residential Securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities using the interest method. Gains or losses on sales of Residential Securities are recorded on trade date based on the specific identification method. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties: To aid in determining projected lives of the securities, we use third party model and market information to project prepayment speeds. Our prepayment speed projections incorporate underlying loan characteristics (i.e., coupon, term, original loan size, original loan-to-value ratio, etc.) and market data, including interest rate and home price index forecasts and expert judgment. Prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets and other factors and cannot be predicted with any certainty. 
 Sensitivity of Estimates to Change: Changes to model assumptions, including interest rates and other market data, as well as periodic revisions to the model will cause changes in the results. Adjustments are made for actual prepayment activity as it relates to calculating the effective yield. The sensitivity of changes in interest rates to our economic net interest income is included in the interest rate shock analysis and discussions within this Item 2 for further information. 

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities 
 Description: We are required to determine if it is required to consolidate entities in which it holds a variable interest. 
 Judgments and Uncertainties: Determining whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires significant judgment related to assessing the purpose and design of the VIE and determination of the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. We must also identify explicit and implicit variable interests in the entity and consider our involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing activities. To determine whether consolidation of the VIE is required, we must apply judgment to assess whether we have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and whether we have either the rights to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE. 

Use of Estimates 
 The use of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
