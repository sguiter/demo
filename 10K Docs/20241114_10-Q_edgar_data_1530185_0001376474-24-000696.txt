Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. 
 
 Assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets due to transfer of ownership after the lease term has expired. 
 
 Maintenance and repairs will be charged to expenses as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments will be capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation will be removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, will be reflected in operations. 
 
 Property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever impairment indicators are prevalent. The Company will assess the recoverability of equipment by determining whether the depreciation and amortization of these assets over their remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of equipment impairment, if any, will be measured based on fair value and is charged to operations in the period in which such impairment is determined by management.

This increase in revenue was due to over 32,000 of programming revenue that happened in 2024 that the Company did not benefit from in 2023, as well as a transfer from deferred revenue of about 48,000 in 2024 as compared to 2023.

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except as discussed below, we are not presently a party to any material litigation, nor to the knowledge of management is any litigation threatened against us, which may materially affect us. 
 
 Meridian Pacific Holdings, LLC filed a lawsuit against certain directors, officers, affiliates, and the Company for breach of contract and fraud, in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles on May 6, 2019. The lawsuit alleges that certain officers of the Company misrepresented the business and asked for financing the business for approximately 1.6 million for operations from Meridian Pacific and never delivered the fiber optic assets promised. The judge in this case dismissed all claims against Ameritek Ventures, Inc. on October 19, 2023. 
 
 The Company filed a lawsuit in the Clark County, Nevada, court against Clinton L. Stokes, III, the former owner of the Company, to settle the matter of shares ownership and that of if the asset coming from Fiber Optic Assets was purchased free and clear of any encumberment from Meridian Financial Group, LLC on March 6, 2023. Meridian Financial Group, LLC has a claim on the assets in the business of fiber optics previously owned by Clinton L. Stokes III. This case is still pending. There is no trial date set as of the date of this filing. This litigation is not expected to have a material effect on the Company.
