classes of members. Our Class A members are customer-owned electric distribution cooperatives engaged in the retail sale of power to member customers located in Virginia, Delaware, and Maryland. Our sole Class B member is TEC, a taxable corporation owned by our member distribution cooperatives. Our board of directors is composed of representatives from each of the member distribution cooperatives and representative from TEC. In accordance with Consolidation Accounting, TEC is considered a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. The assets and liabilities and non-controlling interest of TEC are recorded at carrying value and the consolidated assets were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. TEC's assets are utilized to settle TEC's liabilities. The income taxes reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Patronage Capital relate to the tax provision for TEC. As TEC is wholly-owned by our Class A members, its equity is presented as a non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. Our rates are set periodically by a formula that was accepted for filing by FERC and are not regulated by the public service commissions of the states in which our member distribution cooperatives operate.

million and commitments under this syndicated credit agreement extend through December 7, 2028. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had outstanding under this facility million and million in borrowings, respectively. Revenue Recognition Our operating revenues are derived from sales of power and renewable energy credits to our member distribution cooperatives and non-members. We supply power requirements (energy and demand) to our eleven member distribution cooperatives subject to substantially identical wholesale power contracts with each of them. We bill our member distribution cooperatives monthly and each member distribution cooperative is required to pay us monthly for power furnished under its wholesale power contract. We transfer control of the electricity over time and our member distribution cooperatives simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of the electricity. The amount we invoice our member distribution cooperatives on a monthly basis corresponds directly to the value to the member distribution cooperatives of our performance, which is determined by our formula rate included in the wholesale power contract. We sell excess energy and renewable energy credits to non-members at prevailing market prices as control is transferred. ODEC sells excess purchased and generated energy not needed to meet the actual needs of our member distribution cooperatives to PJM, TEC, or other counterparties. Our financial statements represent the consolidated financial statements of ODEC and TEC and through the consolidation process, all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated and TEC s sales are reflected as non-member revenues. The rates we charge our member distribution cooperatives are regulated by FERC and FERC has granted us authority to charge our member distribution cooperatives utilizing a formula rate and market-based rates.

Recent EPA Developments In May 2023, the EPA proposed performance standards for both new and existing generating units for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The proposed standards included emissions guidelines that would set limits for new gas-fired combustion turbines, existing coal, oil, and gas-fired steam generating units, and certain existing gas-fired combustion turbines. On May 9, 2024, the final rule, which contains requirements to either retrofit existing coal units with carbon controls or retire the asset, was published in the Federal Register and became effective July 8, 2024. Also beginning on May 9, 2024, multiple lawsuits were filed against the EPA to seek judicial review of the final regulation and multiple petitions were filed seeking to stay implementation of the rule. On July 19, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied requests to stay the rule. On July 23, 2024, multiple entities filed an emergency stay application with the United States Supreme Court and on October 16, 2024, the United States Supreme Court denied the requests to stay the rule. The litigation continues in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and is proceeding on an expedited schedule. We are continuing to monitor this standard as it relates to our generating facilities, particularly Clover. We will be able to determine our compliance strategies after state implementation plans have been developed related to the rule. Based on the uncertainties associated with the state implementation plans, we cannot yet determine whether the final rule will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows in future periods. Further, there is no material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows for the period ending September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S D ISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Caution Regarding Forward-looking Statements 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements regarding matters that could have an impact on our business, financial condition, and future operations. These statements, based on our expectations and estimates, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, but are not limited to: general business conditions; demand for energy; federal and state legislative and regulatory actions, and legal and administrative proceedings; changes in and compliance with environmental laws and regulations; general credit and capital market conditions; weather conditions; the cost and availability of commodities used in our industry; disruption due to cybersecurity threats or incidents; and unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our actual results may vary materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of these and other factors. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which the statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These policies include the accounting for regulated operations, deferred energy, margin stabilization, accounting for asset retirement and environmental obligations, and accounting for derivatives and hedging. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying financial statements reflect the consolidated accounts of ODEC and TEC. See Note 1 General in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1. 
 Overview 
 We are a not-for-profit power supply cooperative owned entirely by our eleven Class A member distribution cooperatives and a Class B member, TEC. We supply our member distribution cooperatives energy and demand requirements through a portfolio of resources including generating facilities, long-term and short-term physically-delivered forward power purchase contracts, and spot market purchases. We also supply the transmission services necessary to deliver this power to our member distribution cooperatives. 
 	 
 Our results from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily impacted by increases in purchased power expense and transmission expense, and the decrease in deferred energy expense. 
 	 
 Total revenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives, which is comprised of sales to our member distribution cooperatives - formula rate and sales to our member distribution cooperatives - market-based rates, increased 2.6 and 4.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

13 

o Total revenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives - formula rate were relatively flat. Formula rate energy revenues decreased 10.5 and 7.2 , respectively, due to the decreases in our total energy rate, partially offset by the increase in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives - formula rate. The weather was milder in 2023 as compared to 2024 and contributed to the increase in 2024 energy sales in MWh. Formula rate demand revenues increased 13.4 and 13.1 , respectively, substantially due to changes in PJM charges for network transmission services and higher capacity costs. 

o Total revenues from sales to our member distribution cooperatives - market-based rates increased 143.9 and 139.4 , respectively, due to load growth related to data centers. 

Purchased power expense, which includes the cost of purchased energy and capacity, increased 20.2 and 10.6 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Purchased capacity costs increased 297.3 and 191.1 , respectively, due to the increase in capacity charges from PJM. Purchased energy costs increased 8.9 and 3.9 , respectively, due to the increase in the volume of purchased energy, partially offset by the decrease in the average cost of purchased energy. 

Transmission expense increased 14.9 and 16.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to changes in PJM charges for network transmission services. 

Deferred energy expense, which represents the difference between energy revenues and energy expenses, decreased 14.7 million and 39.1 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to the decreases in our total energy rate. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we over-collected 24.1 million and 47.5 million, respectively. 

Factors Affecting Results 
 For a comprehensive discussion of factors affecting results, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results in Item 7 in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Formula Rate 
 Our power sales are comprised of two power products energy and demand. Energy is the physical electricity delivered through transmission and distribution facilities to customers. We must have sufficient committed energy available to us for delivery to our member distribution cooperatives to meet their maximum energy needs at any time, with limited exceptions. This committed available energy at any time is referred to as demand. 
 The rates we charge our member distribution cooperatives are regulated by FERC and FERC has granted us authority to charge our member distribution cooperatives utilizing a formula rate and market-based rates. In accordance with our wholesale power contracts with our member distribution cooperatives, we sell power to them utilizing a formula rate. An exception in the formula rate allows our member distribution cooperatives to elect to utilize market-based rates for new and expanding loads that meet certain criteria. 
 The rates we charge our member distribution cooperatives under the formula rate are intended to permit collection of revenues which will equal the sum of: 
 	 
 all of our costs and expenses; 

20 of our total interest charges (margin requirement); and 

additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors. 

The formula rate identifies the cost components that we can collect through rates, but not the actual amounts to be collected. With limited minor exceptions, we can change our rates periodically to match the costs we have incurred and we expect to incur without seeking FERC approval. 
 14 

Our margin requirement and additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors are recovered through our demand rates. We establish our demand rates to produce a net margin attributable to ODEC equal to 20 of our budgeted total interest charges, plus additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors. The formula rate permits us to adjust revenues from the member distribution cooperatives to equal our actual total demand costs incurred, including a net margin attributable to ODEC equal to 20 of actual interest charges, plus additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors. We make these adjustments utilizing Margin Stabilization. 
 As detailed in the table below, we utilized Margin Stabilization to increase revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and to reduce revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Weather 
 Weather affects the demand for electricity. Relatively higher or lower temperatures tend to increase the demand for energy to use air conditioning and heating systems, respectively. Mild weather generally reduces the demand because heating and air conditioning systems are operated less. Weather also plays a role in the price of energy through its effects on the market price for fuel, particularly natural gas. 
 Heating and cooling degree days are measurement tools used to quantify the need to utilize heating or cooling, respectively, for a building. Heating degree days are calculated as the number of degrees below 60 degrees in a single day. Cooling degree days are calculated as the number of degrees above 65 degrees in a single day. In a single calendar day, it is possible to have multiple heating degree and cooling degree days. 
 The heating and cooling degree days for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were as follows:

Generating Facilities 
 Our operating expenses, and consequently our rates charged to our member distribution cooperatives, are significantly affected by the operations of our generating facilities, which are under dispatch direction of PJM. PJM balances its members power requirements with the power resources available to supply those requirements. Based on this evaluation of supply and demand, PJM schedules and directs the dispatch of available generating facilities throughout its region in a manner intended to meet the demand for energy in the most reliable and cost-effective manner. Thus, PJM directs the dispatch of these facilities even though it does not own them. For further discussion of PJM, see Business Power Supply Resources PJM in Item 1 in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Results of Operations 
 Operating Revenues 
 Our operating revenues are derived from sales of power and renewable energy credits to our member distribution cooperatives and non-members. ODEC sells excess purchased and generated energy not needed to meet the actual needs of our member distribution cooperatives to PJM, TEC, or other counterparties. Our financial statements represent the consolidated financial statements of ODEC and TEC and through the consolidation process, all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated and TEC s sales are reflected as non-member revenues. Our operating revenues and energy sales in MWh by type of purchaser for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:

Member Distribution Cooperatives 
 The rates we charge our member distribution cooperatives are regulated by FERC and FERC has granted us authority to charge our member distribution cooperatives utilizing a formula rate and market-based rates. In accordance with our wholesale power contracts with our member distribution cooperatives, we sell power to them utilizing a formula rate. An exception in the formula rate allows our member distribution cooperatives to elect to utilize market-based rates for new and expanding loads that meet certain criteria.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total formula rate revenues were relatively flat as compared to the same periods in 2023. Formula rate energy revenues decreased 16.4 million, or 10.5 , and 31.5 million, or 7.2 , respectively, due to the decreases in our total energy rate, partially offset by the 6.3 and 14.5 , increase in energy sales in MWh to our member distribution cooperatives - formula rate, respectively. The weather was milder in 2023 as compared to 2024 and contributed to the increase in 2024 energy sales in MWh. Formula rate demand revenues increased 14.9 million, or 13.4 , and 42.3 million, or 13.1 , respectively, substantially due to changes in PJM charges for network transmission services and higher capacity costs. 
 The following table summarizes the changes to our total energy rate since 2023, which were implemented to address the differences in our realized as well as projected energy costs:

Our operating expenses are comprised of the costs that we incur to generate and purchase power to meet the needs of our member distribution cooperatives, and the costs associated with any sales of power to non-members. Our energy costs generally are variable and include fuel expense, the energy portion of our purchased power expense, and the variable portion of operations and maintenance expense. Our demand costs generally are fixed and include the capacity portion of our purchased power expense, transmission expense, the fixed portion of operations and maintenance expense, administrative and general expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. Additionally, all non-operating expenses and income items, including investment income and interest charges, net, are components of our demand costs. See Factors Affecting Results Formula Rate above. 
 20 

Total operating expenses increased 13.5 million, or 4.9 , and 31.1 million, or 4.0 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily as a result of increases in purchased power expense and transmission expense, partially offset by the decrease in deferred energy expense. 
 Purchased power expense, which includes the cost of purchased energy and capacity, increased 18.0 million, or 20.2 , and 26.0 million, or 10.6 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Purchased capacity costs increased 10.4 million, or 297.3 , and 16.8 million, or 191.1 , respectively, due to the increase in capacity charges from PJM. Purchased energy costs increased 7.6 million, or 8.9 , and 9.3 million, or 3.9 , respectively, due to the 19.2 and 32.4 increase in the volume of purchased energy, partially offset by the 8.6 and 21.6 decrease in the average cost of purchased energy. 

Transmission expense increased 6.6 million, or 14.9 , and 21.1 million, or 16.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to changes in PJM charges for network transmission services. 

Deferred energy expense, which represents the difference between energy revenues and energy expenses, decreased 14.7 million and 39.1 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to the decreases in our total energy rate. For further discussion on deferred energy, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Deferred Energy" in Item 7 in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Other Items 
 Interest Charges, Net 
 The primary factors affecting our interest charges, net are issuances of indebtedness, scheduled payments of principal on our indebtedness, interest charges related to our revolving credit facility (including fees), and interest paid to our member distribution cooperatives on prepayment balances. The major components of interest charges, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:

Net Margin Attributable to ODEC 
 Net margin attributable to ODEC, which is a function of our total interest charges plus any additional equity contributions approved by our board of directors, was 9.5 and 5.5 lower for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, due to the decrease in total interest charges. 
 Financial Condition 
 The principal changes in our financial condition from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, were caused by increases in accounts payable members, deferred energy, nuclear decommissioning trust, and regulatory liabilities; substantially offset by the decrease in revolving credit facility. 
 Accounts payable members increased 75.3 million due to the 72.1 million increase in member prepayments and the 3.1 million increase in the amounts owed to our member distribution cooperatives under Margin Stabilization. 

21 

Deferred energy increased 47.5 million due to the over-collection of our energy costs in 2024. 

Nuclear decommissioning trust increased 36.4 million due to the 20.8 million increase in the fair value of the fund and the 15.6 million realized gain and earnings on the fund. 

Regulatory liabilities increased 31.5 million primarily due to the change in the unrealized gain on the nuclear decommissioning trust and the increase in derivatives. 

Revolving credit facility decreased 136.0 million due to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources 
 Cash generated by our operations, periodic borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and occasional issuances of long-term debt provide our sources of liquidity and capital. 
 Operations 
 During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, our operating activities provided cash flows of 249.3 million and 61.8 million, respectively. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 We maintain a revolving credit facility to cover our short-term and medium-term funding needs that are not met by cash from operations or other available funds. Available funding under this facility totals 400 million and commitments under this syndicated credit agreement extend through December 7, 2028. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding under this facility 55.0 million and 191.0 million in borrowings, respectively. 
 Financings 
 We fund the portion of our capital expenditures that we are not able to fund from operations through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt in the capital markets. These capital expenditures consist primarily of the costs related to the development, construction, acquisition, or improvement of our owned generating and transmission facilities. We continue to evaluate the issuance of additional long-term indebtedness in the near term to fund capital expenditures related to our existing generating and transmission facilities. Additionally, we are evaluating the need to construct new generating facilities, which could result in the issuance of additional long-term indebtedness. We believe our cash from operations, funds available from our revolving credit facility, and issuances of additional long-term indebtedness, will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated future operational and capital requirements. 
 Uses 
 Our uses of liquidity and capital relate to funding our working capital needs, investment activities, and financing activities. Substantially all of our investment activities relate to capital expenditures in connection with our generating facilities. Additionally, we have asset retirement obligations in the future that are significantly offset by the nuclear decommissioning trust, which as of September 30, 2024, had a balance of 297.0 million. Our future contingent obligations primarily relate to power purchase and natural gas arrangements, and we have no off-balance sheet obligations. Some of our power purchase contracts obligate us to provide credit support if our obligations issued under the Indenture are rated below specified thresholds by S P and Moody s. We currently anticipate that cash from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and potential issuances of long-term indebtedness will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the near term, including planned capital expenditures, decommissioning trust obligations, and our contingent obligations as described above. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIV E AND QUALITATIVE 
 DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 No material changes occurred in our exposure to market risk during the third quarter of 2024. 
 22 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that all material information required to be filed in this report has been made known to them in a timely manner. We have established a Disclosure Assessment Committee comprised of members of our senior and middle management to assist in this evaluation. 
 There have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect such controls during the past fiscal quarter.

 PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Other Matters 
 Other than certain legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business that management believes will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition, there is no other litigation pending or threatened against us . 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 ITEM 5. OTH ER INFORMATION 
 or , as those terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K. We have debt securities but equity securities outstanding because we are a cooperative. See Business Overview in Item 1 in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Mr. Kirk D. Johnson ceased to serve as Senior Vice President of Member Relations at ODEC effective November 5, 2024. 

 Recent EPA Developments 
 In May 2023, the EPA proposed performance standards for both new and existing generating units for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The proposed standards included emissions guidelines that would set limits for new gas-fired combustion turbines, existing coal, oil, and gas-fired steam generating units, and certain existing gas-fired combustion turbines. 
 On May 9, 2024, the final rule, which contains requirements to either retrofit existing coal units with carbon controls or retire the asset, was published in the Federal Register and became effective July 8, 2024. Also beginning on May 9, 2024, multiple lawsuits were filed against the EPA to seek judicial review of the final regulation and multiple petitions were filed seeking to stay implementation of the rule. On July 19, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied requests to stay the rule. On July 23, 2024, multiple entities filed an emergency stay application with the United States Supreme Court and on October 16, 2024, the United States Supreme Court denied the requests to stay the rule. The litigation continues in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and is proceeding on an expedited schedule. We are continuing to monitor this standard as it relates to our generating facilities, particularly Clover. We will be able to determine our compliance strategies after state implementation plans have been developed related to the rule. Based on the uncertainties associated with the state implementation plans, we cannot yet determine whether the final rule will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows in future periods. Further, there is no material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows for the period ending September 30, 2024.
