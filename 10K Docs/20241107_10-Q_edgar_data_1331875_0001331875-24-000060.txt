Income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes was and in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases in income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before taxes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 are primarily attributable to more valuation allowance being released in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, and less valuation allowance being recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023.

 . Each period subsequent to contract inception, the attributed fee ratio is used to calculate the fair value of the MRBs using a risk neutral valuation method and is based on current net amounts at risk, market data, internal and industry experience, and other factors. The balances are computed using assumptions including mortality, full and partial surrender, GMWB utilization, risk-free rates including non-performance spread and risk margin, market value of options, and economic scenarios. Policyholder behavior assumptions are reviewed at least annually, typically in the third quarter, for any revisions. Reinsured MRBs are valued using a methodology consistent with direct MRBs, with the exception of the non-performance spread, which reflects the credit of the reinsurer. MRBs can either be in an asset or liability position and are presented separately on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the right of setoff criteria are not met. Changes in fair value, net, are recognized in Market risk benefits (gains) losses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings, except for the change in fair value due to a change in our instrument-specific credit risk, which is recognized in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Earnings. See a description of the fair value methodology used in Note C Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note P Market Risk Benefits .

 Several lawsuits were filed by various parties against Chicago Title Company and Chicago Title Insurance Company as its principal (collectively, the Named Companies by plaintiffs claiming they were investors who were solicited by Gina Champion-Cain through her former company, ANI Development LLC ANI ), or other affiliates to provide funds placed in an escrow account that purportedly were to be used for high-interest, short-term loans to parties seeking to acquire California alcoholic beverage licenses. Plaintiffs further alleged that employees of Chicago Title Company assisted Ms. Champion-Cain and her entities in diverting the funds placed into an escrow account maintained by Chicago Title Company into which some of the plaintiffs funds were deposited. 
 In connection with the alcoholic beverage license scheme, the SEC filed a civil enforcement proceeding asserting claims for securities fraud against Champion-Cain and ANI in a lawsuit styled, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Gina Champion-Cain and ANI Development, LLC , pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The receiver, who was appointed by the court to preserve the assets of the defendant affiliated entities, then filed a lawsuit in San Diego County Superior Court against the Named Companies seeking damages in a lawsuit styled, Krista Freitag v. Chicago Title Co. and Chicago Title Ins. Co. The Named Companies reached a global settlement with the receiver and several other investor claimants and jointly sought court approval of the global settlement and entry of an order barring any claims against the Named Companies related to the alcoholic beverage license scheme. On November 23, 2022, the federal court overruled any objections by non-joining investors and entered an order approving the global settlement barring further claims against the Named Companies Settlement and Bar Order ). After her receipt of the settlement funds, the receiver dismissed the lawsuit against the Named Companies. Some of the non-joining investor claimants who objected to entry of the Settlement and Bar Order appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by (Cases 22-56206, 22-56208, and 23-55083). Appellate oral argument was held on August 13, 2024, and a decision is pending with the court. 
 
 Chicago Title Company has also resolved a number of other pre-suit claims and previously-disclosed lawsuits from both individual and groups of alleged investors under confidential terms. Based on the facts and circumstances of the remaining claims, including the settlements already reached, we have recorded reserves included in our reserve for title claim losses, which we believe are adequate to cover losses related to this matter, and believe that our reserves for title claim losses are adequate. 
 We continually upda te loss reserve estimates as new information becomes known, new loss patterns emerge, or as other contributing factors are considered and incorporated into the analysis of reserve for claim losses. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims are paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims, and other factors. 
 Due to the uncertainty inherent in the process and to the judgment used by management, the ultimate liability may be greater or less than our current reserves. If actual claims loss development varies from what is currently expected and is not offset by other factors, additional reserve adjustments may be required in future periods to maintain our recorded reserve within a reasonable range of our actuary's central estimate.

 Valuation Methodologies 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The carrying amounts reported in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these instruments approximate fair value. 
 Fixed Maturity Preferred and Equity Securities 
 We measure the fair value of our securities based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the security. The most appropriate valuation methodology is selected based on the specific characteristics of the fixed maturity, preferred or equity security, and we will then consistently apply the valuation methodology to measure the security s fair value. Our fair value measurement is based on a market approach, which utilizes prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. Sources of inputs to the market approach include third-party pricing services, independent broker quotations, or pricing matrices. We use observable and unobservable inputs in our valuation methodologies. Observable inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including market research publications. In addition, market indicators and industry and economic events are monitored and further market data will be acquired when certain thresholds are met. 
 For certain security types, additional inputs may be used, or some of the inputs described above may not be applicable. The significant input used in the fair value measurement of equity securities for which the market approach valuation technique is employed is yield for comparable securities. Increases or decreases in the yields would result in lower or higher, respectively, fair value measurements. For broker-quoted only securities, quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized to be market participants. We believe the broker quotes are prices at which trades could be executed based on historical trades executed at broker-quoted or slightly higher prices.

 since F G will not be required to make any additional payments at maturity of the fund-linked note in order to receive the NAV of the fund on the maturity date. A Black-Scholes model determines the NAV of the fund as the fair value of the equity option regardless of the values used for the other inputs to the option pricing model. The NAV of the fund is provided by the fund manager at the end of each calendar month and represents the value an investor would receive if it withdrew its investment on the balance sheet date. Therefore, the key unobservable input used in the Black-Scholes model is the value of the fund. As the value of the fund increases or decreases, the fair value of the embedded

 Valuation Methodologies and Associated Inputs for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 
 The following discussion outlines the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments not carried at fair value. Considerable judgment is required to develop these assumptions used to measure fair value. Accordingly, the estimates shown are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a one-time, current market exchange of all of our financial instruments. 
 Mortgage Loans 
 The fair value of mortgage loans is established using a discounted cash flow method based on internal credit rating, maturity, and future income. This yield-based approach is sourced from our third-party vendor. The internal ratings for mortgages in good standing are based on property type, location, market conditions, occupancy, debt service coverage, loan-to-value, quality of tenancy, borrower, and payment record. The inputs used to measure the fair value of our mortgage loans are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Policy Loans (included within Other long-term investments) 
 Policy loans are reported at the unpaid principal balance and are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of underlying insurance policies. The carrying value of the policy loans approximates the fair value and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Company Owned Life Insurance 
 Company owned life insurance ("COLI") is a life insurance program used to finance certain employee benefit expenses. The fair value of COLI is based on net realizable value, which is generally cash surrender value. COLI is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 
 Other Invested Assets (included within Other long-term investments) 
 The fair value of bank loans is estimated using a discounted cash flow method with the discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"). This yield-based approach is sourced from a third-party vendor and the WACC establishes a market participant discount rate by determining the hypothetical capital structure for the asset should it be underwritten as of each period end. Bank loans are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. For cost method investments, our carrying value approximates fair value. Cost method investments are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. 
 Investment Contracts 
 Investment contracts include deferred annuities (indexed annuities and fixed rate annuities), IUL policies, funding agreements and pension risk transfers ("PRT"), and immediate annuity contracts without life contingencies. The indexed annuities/IUL embedded derivatives, included in contractholder funds, are excluded as they are carried at fair value. The fair value of the deferred annuities (indexed annuities and fixed rate annuities) and IUL contracts is based on their cash surrender value (i.e., the cost the Company would incur to extinguish the liability) as these contracts are generally issued without an annuitization date. The fair value of funding agreements and PRT and immediate annuity contracts without life contingencies is derived by calculating a new fair value interest rate using the updated yield curve and treasury spreads as of the respective reporting date. The Company is not required to, and has not, estimated the fair value of the liabilities under contracts that involve significant mortality or morbidity risks, as these liabilities fall within the definition of insurance contracts that are exceptions from financial instruments that require disclosures of fair value. 
 Other 
 Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta FHLB common stock is carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The carrying amount of FHLB common stock represents the value it can be sold back to the FHLB and is classified as Level 2 within the hierarchy. 
 Debt 
 The fair value of debt, with the exception of the F G Credit Agreement is based on quoted market prices. The carrying value of the F G Credit Agreement approximates fair value as the rates are comparable to those at which we could currently borrow under similar terms. The inputs used to measure the fair value of our outstanding debt are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

 For investments for which NAV is used as a practical expedient for fair value, we do not have any significant restrictions in our ability to liquidate our positions in these investments, other than obtaining general partner approval, nor do we believe it is probable that a price less than NAV would be received in the event of a liquidation.

 Allowance for Expected Credit Loss 
 We regularly review AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be credit related. For our fixed maturity securities, we generally consider the following in determining whether our unrealized losses are credit related, and if so, the magnitude of the credit loss: 
 The extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; 
 The reasons for the decline in value (credit event, currency or interest-rate related, including general credit spread widening); 
 The financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer (including issuer's current credit rating and the probability of full recovery of principal based upon the issuer's financial strength); 
 Current delinquencies and nonperforming assets of underlying collateral; 
 Expected future default rates; 
 Collateral value by vintage, geographic region, industry concentration or property type; 
 Subordination levels or other credit enhancements as of the balance sheet date as compared to origination; and 
 Contractual and regulatory cash obligations and the issuer's plans to meet such obligations. 
 We recognize an allowance for current expected credit losses on fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position when it is determined, using the factors discussed above, a component of the unrealized loss is related to credit. We measure the credit loss using a discounted cash flow model that utilizes the single best estimate cash flow and the recognized credit loss is limited to the total unrealized loss on the security (i.e., the fair value floor). Cash flows are discounted using the implicit yield of bonds at their time of purchase and the current book yield for asset and mortgage-backed securities as well as variable rate securities. We recognize the expected credit losses in Recognized gains and losses, net in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings, with an offset for the amount of non-credit impairments recognized in AOCI. We do not measure a credit loss allowance on accrued investment income because we write-off accrued interest through Interest and investment income when collectability concerns arise. 
 We consider the following in determining whether write-offs of a security s amortized cost are necessary: 
 We believe amounts related to securities have become uncollectible; 
 We intend to sell a security; or 
 It is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security prior to recovery.

 The unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were caused by higher treasury rates compared to those at the time of the F G acquisition or purchase of the security if later. For securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, our allowance for expected credit loss was million. We believe the unrealized loss position for which we have recorded an allowance for expected credit loss as of September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to interest rate increases, near-term illiquidity, and other macroeconomic uncertainties as opposed to issuer specific credit concerns.

 and of our total investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The mortgage loans in our investment portfolio are generally comprised of high quality commercial first lien and mezzanine real estate loans. Mortgage loans are primarily on income producing properties including industrial properties, retail buildings, multifamily properties, and office buildings. We diversify our CML portfolio by geographic region and property type to attempt to reduce concentration risk. We continuously evaluate CMLs based on relevant current information to ensure properties are performing at a consistent and acceptable level to secure the related debt.

 Loan-to-value LTV and debt service coverage DSC ratios are measures commonly used to assess the risk and quality of mortgage loans. The LTV ratio is expressed as a percentage of the amount of the loan relative to the value of the underlying property. A LTV ratio in excess of 100 indicates the unpaid loan amount exceeds the underlying collateral. The DSC ratio, based upon the most recently received financial statements, is expressed as a percentage of the amount of a property s net income to its debt service payments. A DSC ratio of less than 1.00 indicates that a property s operations do not generate sufficient income to cover debt payments. We normalize our DSC ratios to a year amortization period for purposes of our general loan allowance evaluation.

 Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 We own investments in variable interest entities ("VIEs") that are not consolidated within our financial statements. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its own activities without additional financial support, where investors lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest, or where the entity is structured with non-substantive voting rights. VIEs are consolidated by their primary beneficiary, a designation given to an entity that receives both the benefits from the VIE as well as the substantive power to make its key economic decisions. While we participate in the benefits from VIEs in which we invest, but do not consolidate, the substantive power to make the key economic decisions for each respective VIE resides with entities not under our common control. It is for this reason that we are not considered the primary beneficiary for the VIE investments that are not consolidated.

On October 4, 2023, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) created a multidistrict litigation (MDL) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1407 to handle all litigation brought by individuals whose information was potentially compromised in connection with the alleged MOVEit vulnerability. Both Miller and Cooper have been transferred to the MDL and are proceeding under MDL Case No. 1:23-md-03083-ADB-PGL. Plaintiffs filed amendments to their complaints, and Defendants filed their omnibus motion to dismiss for lack of Article III standing on July 23, 2024.

 The cash flow assumptions used to amortize VOBA and DAC were consistent with the assumptions used to estimate the future policy benefits FPB for life contingent immediate annuities, and will be reviewed and unlocked, if applicable, in the same period as those balances. For nonparticipating traditional life contracts, the VOBA amortization is straight-line, without the use of cash flow assumptions. For indexed annuity contracts, the cash flow assumptions used to amortize VOBA, DAC, and DSI were consistent with the assumptions used to estimate the value of the embedded derivative and MRBs, and will be reviewed and unlocked, if applicable, in the same period as those balances. For fixed rate annuities and IUL the cash flow assumptions used to amortize VOBA, DAC and DSI reflect the Company s best estimates for policyholder behavior, consistent with the development of assumptions for indexed annuities and immediate annuities. 
 
 We review cash flow assumptions annually, generally in the third quarter. In 2024 and 2023, F G undertook a review of all significant assumptions and revised several assumptions relating to our deferred annuity (indexed annuity and fixed rate annuity) and IUL products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we updated assumptions including surrender rates, GMWB election timing, premium persistency, and option budgets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we updated assumptions including surrender rates, partial withdrawal rates, mortality improvement, and option budgets. All updates to these assumptions brought us more in line with our company and overall industry experience since the prior assumption update.

 On September 15, 2020, we completed our underwritten public offering of million aggregate principal amount of our Notes due March 15, 2031 (the " Notes") pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the SEC. The net proceeds from the registered offering of the Notes were approximately million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the offering (i) to repay all our million outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan, and (ii) for general corporate purposes. 
 On June 12, 2020, we completed our underwritten public offering of million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due June 15, 2030 (the Notes pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the SEC.

We used the net proceeds from the offering (i) to repay million of the outstanding principal amount under the Term Loan, and (ii) for general corporate purposes. 
 On June 1, 2020, as a result of the F G acquisition, we assumed million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 (the " F G Notes"), originally issued on April 20, 2018 at of face value for proceeds of million. In 2024, F G used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of million aggregate principal amount of its F G Notes to repay an aggregate principal amount of million of the F G Notes. 
 On August 13, 2018, we completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of notes due August 2028 (the " Notes"), pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes were priced at of par to yield annual interest. We pay interest on the Notes semi-annually on the 15th of February and August, beginning February 15, 2019. The Notes contain customary covenants and events of default for investment grade public debt, which primarily relate to failure to make principal or interest payments. On May 16, 2019, we completed an offering to exchange the Notes for substantially identical notes registered pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the " Notes Exchange"). There were no material changes to the terms of the Notes as a result of the Notes Exchange and all holders of the Notes accepted the offer to exchange.

 The net MRB liability increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of collection of attributed fees, interest accrual, MRB reserves for contracts issued within the period, and changes in actuarial assumptions. These increases were partially offset by the effects of market related movements, including the impacts of higher risk-free rates and increases in the equity market related projections. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, notable changes made to the inputs to the fair value estimates of MRBs calculations included an increase in risk-free rates leading to a favorable change in the MRBs associated with indexed annuities and fixed rate annuities; increases in the equity market related projections resulted in a decrease in the net amount at risk associated with indexed annuities, leading to a favorable change in the value of the associated MRBs; and an increase in the rider benefit utilization assumption, leading to an unfavorable change in the value of the associated MRBs. 
 The net MRB liability increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of attributed fees collected, increases as a result of actual policyholder behavior different than expected and changes in assumptions as discussed below.

 Annually, typically in the third quarter, we review assumptions associated with reserves for policy benefits and product guarantees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on policyholder behavior, experience and interest rate movements, we reflected updates to surrender assumptions for recent and expected near term policyholder behavior, as well as updated certain FIA assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivative component within contractholder funds. These changes resulted in a decrease in total benefits and other changes in policy reserves of approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, based on increases in interest rates and pricing changes, we updated certain FIA assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivative component within contractholder funds and also aligned reserves to actual policyholder behavior. These changes resulted in an increase in total benefits and other changes in policy reserves of approximately million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Premium deficiency testing 
 F G conducts annual premium deficiency testing for its long-duration contracts except for the FPB for nonparticipating traditional and limited-payment contracts. F G also conducts annual premium deficiency testing for the VOBA of all long-duration contracts. Premium deficiency testing is performed by reviewing assumptions used to calculate the insurance liabilities and determining whether the sum of the existing contract liabilities and the present value of future gross premiums is sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and settlement costs and recover unamortized present value of future profits. Anticipated investment income, based on F G s experience, is considered when performing premium deficiency testing for long-duration contracts. During 2024, F G was not required to establish any additional liabilities as a result of premium deficiency testing. 
 
 F G made changes to assumptions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. Significant assumption inputs used in the calculation of our FPB are described below. Refer to the tables above for further details on changes to our FPB.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding our expectations, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the future. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. It is important to note that our actual results could vary materially from those forward-looking statements contained herein due to many factors, including, but not limited to: the potential impact of the F G Distribution on relationships, including employees, suppliers, customers and competitors; changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets and geopolitical uncertainties associated with international conflict; weakness or adverse changes in the level of real estate activity, which may be caused by, among other things, high or increasing interest rates, a limited supply of mortgage funding, or a weak U.S. economy; our potential inability to find suitable acquisition candidates, acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our traditional areas of focus, or difficulties in consummating and integrating acquisitions; our dependence on distributions from our title insurance underwriters as our main source of cash flow; significant competition that our operating subsidiaries face; compliance with extensive government regulation of our operating subsidiaries; and other risks detailed in the Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information, Risk Factors and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K (our "Annual Report") for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings with the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used herein, the terms we, us, our, the Company or FNF refer collectively to Fidelity National Financial, Inc., and its subsidiaries. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Overview 
 For a description of our business, including descriptions of segments and recent business developments, see the discussion in Note A Basis of Financial Statements in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 2. 
 Business Trends and Conditions 
 Title 
 Our Title segment revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity that includes sales, mortgage financing and mortgage refinancing. Declines in the level of real estate activity or the average price of real estate sales will adversely affect our title insurance revenues. 
 We have found that residential real estate activity is generally dependent on the following factors: 
 mortgage interest rates; 
 mortgage funding supply; 
 housing inventory and home prices; 
 supply and demand for commercial real estate; and 
 the strength of the United States economy, including employment levels. 
 The most recent forecast of the Mortgage Bankers Association ("MBA"), as of October 27, 2024, estimates (actual for fiscal year 2023) the size of the U.S. residential mortgage originations market as shown in the following table for 2023 - 2026 in its "Mortgage Finance Forecast" (in trillions): 
 2026 2025 2024 2023 Purchase originations 1.6 1.5 1.3 1.3 Refinance originations 0.8 0.8 0.5 0.2 Total U.S. mortgage originations forecast 2.4 2.3 1.8 1.5 
 As of October 27, 2024, the MBA expects residential purchase transactions to remain relatively flat through 2024 before increasing in 2025 and 2026, and expects residential refinance transactions to increase in 2024 and 2025 but remain flat in 2026, and overall mortgage originations to increase in 2024, 2025, and 2026. 
 Average interest rates for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage were 6.5 and 6.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.0 and 6.7 for the corresponding periods in 2023, respectively. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75 - 5.0 , the first cut in interest rates 
 69 

Table of Contents 

 since the Federal Reserve's emergency response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020. On November 7, 2024, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by an additional 25 basis points. 
 A shortage in the supply of homes for sale, increasing home prices, high mortgage interest rates, disrupted labor markets and geopolitical uncertainties associated with international conflicts created some volatility in the residential real estate market in 2023 and 2024. Existing-home sales decreased 3.5 in September 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 while median existing-home sales prices increased to 404,500, or approximately 3 , from the corresponding period in 2023. 
 Other economic indicators used to measure the health of the U.S. economy, including the unemployment rate, have remained strong. The unemployment rate was 4.1 and 3.8 in September 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We issue commercial title insurance policies in sectors including office, industrial, energy, hospitality, retail, and multi-family, among others. The demand for commercial title insurance varies based on a variety of factors such as investor appetite, financing availability, and supply and demand in a particular area. Because commercial real estate transactions tend to be generally driven by supply and demand for commercial space in a particular area rather than by interest rate fluctuations, we believe that our commercial real estate title insurance business is less dependent on the industry cycles discussed above than our residential real estate title business. Factors including U.S. tax reform and a shift in U.S. monetary policy have had, or are expected to have, varying effects on availability of financing in the U.S. Lower corporate and individual tax rates and corporate tax-deductibility of capital expenditures have provided increased capacity and incentive for investments in commercial real estate. In recent years, we experienced fluctuating demand in commercial real estate markets. Commercial volumes and commercial fee-per-file were depressed in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 when compared to recent prior periods. 
 We continually monitor mortgage origination trends and believe that, based on our ability to produce industry leading operating margins through all economic cycles, we are well positioned to adjust our operations for adverse changes in real estate activity and to take advantage of increased volume when demand increases. 
 Seasonality. H istorically, real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue fluctuations in the real estate industry. The first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during January and February. The second and third calendar quarters are typically the strongest quarters in terms of revenue, primarily due to a higher volume of residential transactions in the spring and summer months. The fourth quarter is typically strong due to the desire of commercial entities to complete transactions by year-end. We have noted short-term fluctuations through recent years in resale and refinance transactions as a result of changes in interest rates. 
 F G 
 The following factors represent some of the key trends and uncertainties that have influenced the development of our F G segment and its historical financial performance, and we believe these key trends and uncertainties will continue to influence the business and financial performance of our F G segment in the future. 
 Market Conditions 
 Market volatility has affected, and may continue to affect, our business and financial performance in varying ways. Volatility can pressure sales and reduce demand as consumers hesitate to make financial decisions. To enhance the attractiveness and profitability of our products and services, we continually monitor the behavior of our customers, as evidenced by annuitization rates and lapse rates in our F G segment, which vary in response to changes in market conditions. See Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion of risk factors that could affect market conditions. 
 Interest Rate Environment 
 Some of our F G products include guaranteed minimum crediting rates, most notably our fixed rate annuities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our reserves, net of reinsurance, and average crediting rate on our fixed rate annuities were 7.0 billion and 4 , respectively. We are required to pay the guaranteed minimum crediting rates even if earnings on our investment portfolio decline, which would negatively impact earnings. In addition, we expect more policyholders to hold policies with comparatively high guaranteed rates for a longer period in a low interest rate environment. Conversely, a rise in average yield on our investment portfolio would increase earnings if the average interest rate we pay on our products does not rise correspondingly. Similarly, we expect that policyholders would be less likely to hold policies with existing guarantees as interest rates rise and the relative value of other new business offerings are increased, which would negatively impact our earnings and cash flows. 
 See Item 7A of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk.

 Aging of the U.S. Population 
 We believe that the aging of the U.S. population will increase the demand for our indexed annuity and indexed universal life ("IUL") products. As the baby boomer generation prepares for retirement, we believe that demand for retirement savings, growth, and income products will grow. Over 10,000 people will turn 65 each day in the United States over the next 15 years, and according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the proportion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 is expected to grow from 19 in 2024 to 21 in 2035. The impact of this growth may be offset to some extent by asset outflows as an increasing percentage of the population begins withdrawing assets to convert their savings into income. 
 Industry Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 We operate in the sector of the insurance industry that focuses on the needs of middle-income Americans. The underserved middle-income market represents a major growth opportunity for us. As a tool for addressing the unmet need for retirement planning, we believe that many middle-income Americans have grown to appreciate the financial certainty that we believe annuities such as our indexed annuity products afford. For example, the fixed index annuity market grew from nearly 12 billion of sales in 2002 to 97 billion of sales in 2023 and the registered index-linked annuities market grew from 11 billion of sales in 2018 to 44 billion of sales in 2023. Additionally, this market demand has positively impacted the IUL market as it has expanded from 100 million of annual sales in 2002 to 3 billion of annual sales in 2023. 
 See Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a more detailed discussion of industry factors and trends affecting our Results of Operations.

 The change in revenue and net earnings from our reportable segments is discussed in further detail at the segment level below. 
 
 Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist primarily of Personnel costs; Other operating expenses, which in our title business are incurred as orders are received and processed; Agent commissions, which are incurred as title agency revenue is recognized; and Benefits and other changes in policy reserves, which in our F G segment are charged to earnings in the period they are earned by the policyholder based on their selected strategy. For traditional life and immediate annuities, policy benefit claims are charged to expense in the period that the claims are incurred, net of reinsurance recoveries. Title insurance premiums, escrow, and title-related fees are generally recognized as income at the time the underlying transaction closes or other service is provided. Direct title operations revenue often lags approximately 45-60 days behind expenses and therefore gross margins may fluctuate. The changes in the market environment, mix of business between direct and agency operations, and the contributions from our various business units have historically impacted margins and net earnings. We have implemented programs and have taken necessary actions to maintain expense levels consistent with revenue streams. However, a short-term lag exists in reducing controllable fixed costs and certain fixed costs are incurred regardless of revenue levels. 
 Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation, and bonuses paid to employees, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. 
 Agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by our third-party agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts. 
 Benefit expenses for deferred annuity, indexed annuity and IUL policies include index credits and interest credited to contractholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of contract account balances, net of reinsurance recoveries. Other changes in policy reserves include the change in the fair value of the indexed annuity embedded derivative and the change in the reserve for secondary guarantee benefit payments. Other changes in policy reserves also include the change in reserves for life insurance products. 
 Other operating expenses consist primarily of facilities expenses, title plant maintenance, premium taxes (which insurance underwriters are required to pay on title premiums in lieu of franchise and other state taxes), appraisal fees and other cost of sales on ServiceLink product offerings and other title-related products, postage and courier services, computer services, professional services, travel expenses, general insurance, and bad debt expense on our trade and notes receivable. 
 The provision for title claim losses includes an estimate of anticipated title and title-related claims, and escrow losses. 
 The change in expenses attributable to our reportable segments is discussed in further detail at the segment level below. 
 Income tax expense was 44 million and 141 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 223 million and 245 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes was 14 and 23 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 20 and 28 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases in income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before taxes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 are primarily attributable to more valuation allowance being released in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, and less valuation allowance being recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has developed guidance known as the Global Anti-Base Erosion Pillar Two minimum tax rules, or Pillar Two, which generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 and are intended to apply to tax years beginning in 2024. As of September 30, 2024, based on the countries in which we do business that have enacted legislation, the Company does not expect these rules to have a material impact on our income tax provision. 
 The Company considers its non-U.S. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. to the extent these earnings are not subject to the U.S. income tax under an anti-deferral tax regime. Given our intent to reinvest these earnings for an indefinite period of time, the Company has not accrued a deferred tax liability on these earnings. A determination of an unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.

 The following table presents the percentages of opened and closed title insurance orders generated by purchase and refinance transactions by our direct operations: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Opened title insurance orders from purchase transactions (1) 73 80 77 79 Opened title insurance orders from refinance transactions (1) 27 20 23 21 100 100 100 100 Closed title insurance orders from purchase transactions (1) 77 80 79 80 Closed title insurance orders from refinance transactions (1) 23 20 21 20 100 100 100 100 
 (1) Percentages exclude consideration of an immaterial number of non-purchase and non-refinance orders. 
 Title premiums from direct operations increased in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was attributable to an increase in the average fee per file and an increase in closed order volume. 
 We experie nced an increase in c losed title insurance order volumes from both purchase and refinance transactions in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023. Total closed order volume was 232,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 224,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 647,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 645,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This represented an overall increase of 4 and 0 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the corresponding periods in 2023. The increases were primarily attributable to lower average mortgage interest rates in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Total opened title insurance order volumes increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 The average fee per file in our direct operations was 3,708 and 3,682 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 3,618 and 3,561 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases in average fee per file in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 are primarily attributable to home price appreciation. The fee per file tends to change as the mix of refinance and purchase transactions changes, because purchase transactions involve the issuance of both a lender s policy and an owner s policy, resulting in higher fees, whereas refinance transactions only require a lender s policy, resulting in lower fees. 
 Title premiums from agency operations increased 61 million, or 8 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 175 million, or 9 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Escrow, title-related and other fees increased by 4 million, or 1 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 7 million, or 0.4 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023. Escrow and title-related fees increased by 8 million, or 4 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 19 million, or 3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023. The increases in escrow and title-related fees in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 are relatively consistent with the increases in direct premiums. Other fees, excluding escrow and title-related fees, decreased by 4 million, or 1 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 12 million, or 1 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The changes in Other fees, excluding escrow and title-related fees, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior periods in 2023 were attributable to various immaterial items. 
 Interest and investment income levels are primarily a function of securities markets, interest rates, and the amount of cash available for investment. Interest and investment income increased 10 million, or 4 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 Net recognized gains were 63 million and 51 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net recognized losses were 46 million and 74 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases in recognized gains and losses, net in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 are primarily attributable to fluctuations in non-cash valuation changes on our equity and preferred security holdings in addition to various other immaterial items. 
 Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation, and bonuses paid to employees, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. Personnel costs increased 34 million, or 5 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 78 million, or 4 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 
 74 

Table of Contents 

 corresponding periods in 2023. The increases are due to inflationary salary and increased variable costs from a modest increase in revenue and earnings. Personnel costs as a percentage of total revenues from direct title premiums and escrow, title-related and other fees were 60 and 59 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 62 and 61 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average employee count in the Title segment was 21,493 and 21,486 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 21,167 and 21,510 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other operating expenses increased by 15 million, or 5 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased by 15 million, or 2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023. Other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue excluding agency premiums, interest and investment income, and recognized gains and losses were 28 and 28 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 29 and 30 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts. Agent commissions and the resulting percentage of agent premiums that we retain vary according to regional differences in real estate closing practices and state regulations. 
 The following table illustrates the relationship of agent premiums and agent commissions, which has remained relatively consistent since 2023: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in millions) Agent premiums 789 100 728 100 2,166 100 1,991 100 Agent commissions 612 78 564 77 1,681 78 1,534 77 Net retained agent premiums 177 22 164 23 485 22 457 23 
 The claim loss provision for title insurance was 61 million and 57 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 168 million and 157 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The provision reflects an average provision rate of 4.5 of title premiums in all periods. We continually monitor and evaluate our loss provision level, actual claims paid, and the loss reserve position each quarter. This loss provision rate is set to provide for losses on current year policies, but due to development of prior years and our long claim duration, it periodically includes amounts of estimated adverse or positive development on prior years' policies.

 Segment Overview 
 Through our majority-owned F G subsidiary, we have five distribution channels across retail and institutional markets. Our three retail channels include agent-based Independent Marketing Organizations ("IMOs"), banks, and broker dealers. We have deep, long-tenured relationships with our network of leading IMOs and their agents to serve the needs of the middle-income market and develop competitive annuity and life products to align with their evolving needs. Upon FNF s ownership and F G s subsequent rating upgrades in mid-2020, we launched into banks and broker dealers. Further, in 2021, we launched into two institutional markets to originate Funding Agreement Backed Notes ("FABN") and pension risk transfer ("PRT") transactions. The FABN Program offers funding agreements to institutional clients by means of capital markets transactions through investment banks. The funding agreements issued under the FABN Program are in addition to those issued to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ("FHLB"). The PRT solutions business was launched by building an experienced team and then working with brokers and institutional consultants for distribution. These markets leverage our existing team's spread-based capabilities as well as our strategic partnership with Blackstone ISG-I Advisors LLC Blackstone ). 
 In setting the features and pricing of our flagship indexed annuity products relative to our targeted net margin, we take into account our expectations regarding (1) the difference between the net investment income we earn and the sum of the interest credited to policyholders and the cost of hedging our risk on the policies; (2) fees, including surrender charges and rider fees, partly offset by vesting bonuses that we pay our policyholders; and (3) a number of related expenses, including benefits and changes in reserves, acquisition costs, and general and administrative expenses.

 Key Components of Our Historical Results of Operations 
 Through our insurance subsidiaries, we issue a broad portfolio of deferred annuities (indexed annuities and fixed rate annuities), IUL insurance, immediate annuities, funding agreements, and PRT solutions. A deferred annuity is a type of contract that accumulates value on a tax deferred basis and typically begins making specified periodic or lump sum payments a certain number of years after the contract has been issued. IUL insurance is a complementary type of contract that accumulates value in a cash value account and provides a payment to designated beneficiaries upon the policyholder s death. An immediate annuity is a type of contract that begins making specified payments within one annuity period (e.g., one month or one year) and typically makes payments of principal and interest earnings over a period of time. As defined by the Iowa Insurance Division, a funding agreement is an agreement for an insurer to accept and accumulate funds and to make one or more payments at future dates in amounts that are not based on mortality or morbidity contingencies of the person to whom the funding agreement is issued. In essence, funding agreement providers issue fixed maturity contracts with fixed or floating interest rates in exchange for a single upfront premium. Our PRT products are comparable to income annuities, as we generally receive a single, upfront premium in exchange for paying a guaranteed stream of future income payments, which are typically fixed in nature but may vary in duration based on participant mortality experience. 
 Under GAAP, premium collections for deferred annuities (indexed annuities and fixed rate annuities), immediate annuities and PRT without life contingency, and deposits received for funding agreements are reported in the financial statements as deposit liabilities (i.e., contractholder funds) instead of as sales or revenues. Similarly, cash payments to customers are reported as decreases in the liability for contractholder funds and not as expenses. Sources of revenues for products accounted for as deposit liabilities are net investment income, surrender charges, cost of insurance and other charges deducted from contractholder funds (i.e., amortization of unearned revenue liabilities ("URL")), and net realized gains (losses) on investments. Components of expenses for products accounted for as deposit liabilities are interest-sensitive and index product benefits (primarily interest credited to account balances or the hedging cost of providing index credits to the policyholder), amortization of value of business acquired ("VOBA"), deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") and deferred sales inducements ("DSI"), and other operating costs and expenses. 
 F G hedges certain portions of its exposure to product related equity market risk by entering into derivative transactions. We purchase derivatives consisting predominantly of equity options and, to a lesser degree, futures contracts (specifically for indexed annuity contracts) on the equity indices underlying the applicable policy. These derivatives are used to offset the reserve impact of the index credits due to policyholders under the indexed annuity and IUL contracts. The majority of all such equity options are one-year options purchased to match the funding requirements underlying the indexed annuity/IUL contracts. We attempt to manage the cost of these purchases through the terms of our indexed annuity/IUL contracts, which permit us to change caps, spread, or participation rates on each policy's annual anniversary, subject to certain guaranteed minimums that must be maintained. The equity options and futures contracts are marked to fair value with the change in fair value included as a component of net investment gains (losses). The change in fair value of the equity options and futures contracts includes the gains and losses recognized at the expiration of the instruments terms or upon early termination and the changes in fair value of open positions. In addition, to reduce market risks from interest rate changes on our earnings associated with our floating rate investments, during 2023 we began to execute pay-float and receive-fixed interest rate swaps. 
 Market Risk Benefits ("MRBs") are contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contract holder from other-than-nominal capital market risk (equity, interest and foreign exchange risk) and expose the Company to other-than-nominal capital market risk. MRBs (inclusive of reinsured MRBs) are measured at fair value using a risk neutral valuation method, which is based on current net amounts at risk, market data, internal and industry experience, and other factors. The change in fair value of MRBs generally reflects impacts from actual policyholder behavior (including surrenders of the benefit), changes in interest rates, and changes in equity market returns. Generally, higher interest rates and equity returns result in gains whereas lower interest rates and equity returns result in losses. Reinsured MRBs are valued using a methodology consistent with direct MRBs, with the exception of the non-performance spread, which reflects the credit of the reinsurer. 
 Earnings from products accounted for as deposit liabilities are primarily generated from the excess of net investment income earned over the sum of interest credited to policyholders and the cost of hedging our risk on indexed annuity/IUL policies. With respect to indexed annuities/IULs, which includes the expenses incurred to fund the index credits. Proceeds received upon expiration or early termination of equity options purchased to fund annual index credits are recorded as part of the change in fair value of derivatives and are largely offset by an expense for index credits earned on annuity contractholder fund balances.

 Revenues 
 Life insurance premiums and other fees 
 Life insurance premiums and other fees primarily reflect premiums on life-contingent PRTs and traditional life insurance products, which are recognized as revenue when due from the policyholder, as well as policy rider fees primarily on indexed annuity policies, the cost of insurance on IUL policies, and surrender charges assessed against policy withdrawals in excess of the policyholder's allowable penalty-free amounts (up to 10 of the prior year's value, subject to certain limitations). The following table summarizes the Life insurance premiums and other fees, on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) Life-contingent pension risk transfer premiums 332 470 1,240 1,207 Traditional life insurance and life-contingent immediate annuity premiums 8 12 29 34 Surrender charges 82 27 195 66 Policyholder fees and other income 84 73 247 216 Life insurance premiums and other fees 506 582 1,711 1,523 
 Life-contingent pension risk transfer premiums decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, reflecting the timing of PRT transactions. As noted above, PRT premiums are subject to fluctuation period to period. 
 Surrender charges increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting increases in withdrawals from policyholders with surrender charges and market value adjustments, primarily on our indexed annuities policies. 
 Policyholder fees and other income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased cost of insurance charges, net of changes in URL on IUL policies from growth in business and higher guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit GMWB rider fees. GMWB rider fees are based on the policyholder's benefit base and are collected at the end of the policy year.

 Interest and investment income is shown net of amounts attributable to certain funds withheld reinsurance agreements, which is passed along to the reinsurer in accordance with the terms of these agreements. Interest and investment income attributable to these agreements, and thus excluded from the totals in the table above, was 181 million and 463 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 102 million and 236 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Recognized gains and losses, net 
 Below is a summary of the major components included in recognized gains and losses, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity available-for-sale securities, equity securities and other invested assets 14 (11) 99 (88) Change in allowance for expected credit losses (10) (4) (33) (33) Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on certain derivatives instruments 377 (327) 515 (170) Change in fair value of reinsurance related embedded derivatives (178) 36 (186) 34 Change in fair value of other derivatives and embedded derivatives 3 (3) 6 Recognized gains and losses, net 206 (309) 401 (257) 
 Recognized gains and (losses), net is shown net of amounts attributable to certain funds withheld reinsurance agreements, which is passed along to the reinsurer in accordance with the terms of these agreements. Recognized net gains (losses) attributable to these agreements, and thus excluded from the totals in the table above, was (177) million and (186) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 43 million and 42 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity available-for-sale securities, equity securities and other invested assets is primarily the result of mark-to-market gains on our preferred and equity securities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity available-for-sale securities, equity securities and other invested assets is primarily the result of unrealized FVO gains on owned distribution investments and mark-to-market gains on our preferred and equity securities. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity available-for-sale securities, equity securities and other invested assets is primarily the result realized losses on fixed maturity available-for-sale securities, partially offset by mark-to-market gains on our equity securities and realized gains on other invested assets.. 
 For all periods, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on certain derivative instruments primarily relate to the net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity options and futures used to hedge indexed annuity and IUL products, 
 78 

Table of Contents 

 including gains on option and futures expiration and changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps. See the table below for primary drivers of gains (losses) on certain derivatives. 
 The fair value of reinsurance related embedded derivative is based on the change in fair value of the underlying assets held in the funds withheld portfolio. 
 We utilize a combination of static (equity options) and dynamic (long futures contracts) instruments in our product hedging strategy. A substantial portion of the equity options and futures contracts are based upon the S P 500 Index with the remainder based upon other equity, bond, and gold market indices. 
 We utilize interest rate swaps to reduce market risks from interest rate changes on our earnings associated with our floating rate investments. 
 The components of the realized and unrealized gains (losses) on certain derivative instruments hedging our indexed annuities, universal life products and floating rate investments are summarized in the table below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) Equity options: Realized gains (losses) 33 (34) 49 (193) Change in unrealized gains (losses) 227 (274) 438 38 Futures contracts: Gains on futures contracts expiration 1 15 6 Change in unrealized gains (losses) 6 (4) 3 (5) Interest rate swap gains (losses) 114 (19) 9 (19) Other derivative investments Gains (losses) on other derivative investments (4) 4 1 3 Total net change in fair value 377 (327) 515 (170) Annual Point-to-Point Change in S P 500 Index during the periods 6 (4) 34 12 Secured Overnight Financing Rates 4.96 5.31 4.96 5.31 
 Realized gains and (losses) on certain derivative instruments are directly correlated to the performance of the indices upon which the equity options and futures contracts are based and the value of the derivatives at the time of expiration compared to the value at the time of purchase. 
 The changes in unrealized gains (losses) due to the net changes in fair value of equity options and futures contracts are driven by the underlying performance of the indices (for example, the S P 500 Index) upon which the equity options and futures contracts are based during each respective period relative to the respective indices on the policyholder buy dates. 
 The net change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was primarily driven by fluctuations in the interest rate index underlying the swap contracts. 
 The average index credits to policyholders are as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average Crediting Rate 5 3 4 1 S P 500 Index: Point-to-point strategy 5 3 4 1 Monthly average strategy 4 2 3 1 Monthly point-to-point strategy 5 4 3 year high water mark 3 5 4 8 
 Actual amounts credited to contractholder fund balances may differ from the index appreciation due to contractual features in the indexed annuity contracts and certain IUL contracts (caps, spreads and participation rates), which allow F G to manage the cost of the options purchased to fund the annual index credits.

 The credits for the periods presented were based on comparing the S P 500 Index on each issue date in the period to the same issue date in the respective prior year periods. 
 Benefits and expenses 
 Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 
 Below is a summary of the major components included in Benefits and other changes in policy reserves: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) PRT agreements 341 479 1,282 1,233 Indexed annuities/IUL market related liability movements 321 (432) 460 56 Index credits, interest credited and bonuses 427 239 1,108 543 Other changes in policy reserves 6 6 14 89 Total benefits and other changes in policy reserves 
 1,095 292 2,864 1,921 
 PRT agreements decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, reflecting the timing of PRT transactions. PRT transactions are subject to fluctuation period to period. 
 The indexed annuities/IUL market related liability movements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are mainly driven by changes in the equity markets, non-performance spreads, and risk free rates during the periods. The change in risk free rates and non-performance spreads increased (decreased) the indexed annuities market related liability by 255 million and (196) million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The change in risk free rates and non-performance spreads increased (decreased) the FIA market related liability by 87 million and (190) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining changes in market value of the market related liability movements for all periods was driven by equity market impacts. See Revenues Recognized gains and losses, net above for summary and discussion of net unrealized gains (losses) on certain derivative instruments. 
 Annually, typically in the third quarter, F G reviews assumptions associated with reserves for policy benefits and product guarantees. 
 During the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on policyholder behavior experience and interest rate movements, we reflected updates to surrender assumptions for recent and expected near term policyholder behavior, as well as updated certain FIA assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivative component within contractholder funds. These changes resulted in decreases in total benefits and other changes in policy reserves of approximately 136 million and 79 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 During the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on increases in interest rates and pricing changes, we updated certain FIA assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivative component within contractholder funds and also aligned reserves to actual policyholder behavior. These changes resulted in a decrease in total benefits and other changes in policy reserves of approximately 23 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase of approximately 74 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Index credits, interest credited and bonuses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were higher compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher index credits and interest credited on indexed annuities and other policies as a result of market movement during the respective periods and higher interest credited associated with the growth in PRT agreements.

 Market risk benefit losses (gains) is primarily driven by attributed fees collected, effects of market related movements (including changes in equity markets and risk-free rates), actual policyholder behavior as compared with expected and changes in assumptions during the periods. 
 Changes in market risk benefit losses (gains) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflect changes in market related movements for the respective periods. 
 In addition, as a result of F G's annual actuarial assumption update process, we updated GMWB rider assumptions for emerging utilization rates related to policyholder behavior. These updates resulted in market risk benefit losses of 24 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Below is a summary of the major components included in depreciation and amortization:

 DAC, VOBA, and DSI are amortized on a constant level basis for the grouped contracts over the expected term of the related contracts to approximate straight-line amortization. Amortization of DAC, VOBA, and DSI increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting increased DAC and DSI associated with the growth of the business. In addition, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption update process, amortization rates on some DAC and DSI balances increased primarily for indexed annuities. Amortization of VOBA also increased approximately 15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting other actuarial model updates and refinements. 
 Amortization of other intangible assets and fixed asset depreciation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included amortization of other intangible assets from our majority owned interests in Roar Joint Venture, LLC ("Roar") and PALH, LLC ("PALH").

 Investment Portfolio 
 The types of assets in which we may invest are influenced by various state laws, which prescribe qualified investment assets applicable to insurance companies. Within the parameters of these laws, we invest in assets giving consideration to four primary investment objectives: (i) maintain robust absolute returns; (ii) provide reliable yield and investment income; (iii) preserve capital; and (iv) provide liquidity to meet policyholder and other corporate obligations. 
 Our investment portfolio is designed to contribute stable earnings, excluding short term mark to market effects, and balance risk across diverse asset classes and is primarily invested in high quality fixed income securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately 59 billion and 52 billion, respectively, and was divided among the following asset classes and sectors: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fair Value Percent Fair Value Percent Fixed maturity securities, available for sale: (Dollars in millions) United States Government full faith and credit 352 1 261 1 United States Government sponsored entities 31 31 United States municipalities, states and territories 1,473 2 1,567 3 Foreign Governments 206 226 Corporate securities: Finance, insurance and real estate 8,622 15 6,895 13 Manufacturing, construction and mining 1,416 2 947 2 Utilities, energy and related sectors 2,888 5 2,374 5 Wholesale/retail trade 3,109 5 2,433 5 Services, media and other 4,576 8 3,930 8 Hybrid securities 596 1 618 1 Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities 2,560 4 2,393 5 Commercial mortgage-backed securities 5,124 9 4,410 9 Asset-backed securities 10,206 17 8,929 17 Collateral loan obligations ("CLO")

 Insurance statutes regulate the type of investments that our life insurance subsidiaries are permitted to make and limit the amount of funds that may be used for any one type of investment. In light of these statutes and regulations, and our business and investment strategy, we generally seek to invest in primarily high-grade fixed-income assets across a wide range of sectors, including Corporate securities, U.S. Government and government-sponsored agency securities, and Structured securities, among others. 
 The NAIC s Securities Valuation Office ("SVO") is responsible for the day-to-day credit quality assessment and valuation of securities owned by state regulated insurance companies. Insurance companies report ownership of securities to the SVO when such securities are eligible for regulatory filings. The SVO conducts credit analysis on these securities for the purpose of assigning an NAIC designation or unit price. Typically, if a security has been rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO"), the SVO utilizes that rating and assigns an NAIC designation based upon the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations.

Table of Contents 

 The NAIC determines ratings for non-agency Residential Mortgage Backed Securities RMBS and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities using modeling that estimates security level expected losses under a variety of economic scenarios. For such assets issued prior to January 1, 2013, an insurer s amortized cost basis in applicable assets can impact the assigned rating. In the tables below, we present the rating of structured securities based on ratings from the NAIC rating methodologies described above (which in some cases do not correspond to rating agency designations). All NAIC designations (e.g., NAIC 1-6) are based on the NAIC methodologies. 
 The following table summarizes the credit quality by NRSRO rating, or NAIC designation equivalent, of our fixed income portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Non-Agency RMBS Exposure 
 Our investment in non-agency RMBS securities is predicated on the conservative and adequate cushion between purchase price and NAIC 1 rating, general lack of sensitivity to interest rates, positive convexity to prepayment rates and correlation between the price of the securities and the unfolding recovery of the housing market. 
 The fair value of our investments in subprime securities and Alt-A RMBS securities were 30 million and 46 million as of September 30, 2024, respectively, and 33 million and 49 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 95 of the subprime and Alt-A RMBS exposures were rated NAIC 2 or higher. 
 ABS and CLO Exposures 
 Our ABS exposures are largely diversified by underlying collateral and issuer type. Our CLO exposures are generally senior tranches of CLOs, which have leveraged loans as their underlying collateral. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the CLO and ABS positions were trading at a net unrealized gain of 103 million and a net unrealized loss of 114 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the CLO and ABS positions were trading at a net unrealized gain of 65 million and a net unrealized loss of 344 million, respectively.

 Mortgage Loans 
 Commercial Mortgage Loans 
 We diversify our commercial mortgage loans ("CMLs") portfolio by geographic region and property type to attempt to reduce concentration risk. We continuously evaluate CMLs based on relevant current information to ensure properties are performing at a level to secure the related debt. Loan-to value ("LTV") and debt-service coverage ("DSC") ratios are utilized to assess the risk and quality of CMLs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our mortgage loans on real estate portfolio had a weighted average DSC ratio of 2.3 times, and a weighted average LTV ratio of 57 and 55 , respectively. 
 We consider a CML delinquent when a loan payment is greater than 30 days past due. For mortgage loans that are determined to require foreclosure, the carrying value is reduced to the fair value of the underlying collateral, net of estimated costs to obtain and sell at the point of foreclosure. As of September 30, 2024, we had one CML that was delinquent in principal or interest payments compared to none at December 31, 2023. We had no CMLs in the process of foreclosure as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note D Investments to the unaudited Condensed Financial Statements included in this report for additional information on our CMLs, including our distribution by property type, geographic region, LTV, and DSC ratios. 
 Residential Mortgage Loans 
 F G's residential mortgage loans ("RMLs") are closed end, amortizing loans, and 100 of the properties are in the United States. F G diversifies its RML portfolio by state to attempt to reduce concentration risk. RMLs have a primary credit quality indicator of either a performing or nonperforming loan. F G defines non-performing RMLs as those that are 90 or more days past due and/or in nonaccrual status. 
 Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they are over 90 days delinquent. If a loan becomes over 90 days delinquent, it is our general policy to initiate foreclosure proceedings unless a workout arrangement to bring the loan current can be put in place. See Note D Investments to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our RMLs.

 Expected Credit Losses and Watch List 
 F G prepares a watch list to identify securities to evaluate for expected credit losses. Factors used in preparing the watch list include fair values relative to amortized cost, ratings and negative ratings actions and other factors. Detailed analysis is performed for each security on the watch list to further assess the presence of credit impairment loss indicators and, where present, calculate an allowance for expected credit loss or direct write-down of a security s amortized cost. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our watch list included 56 securities in an unrealized loss position with an amortized cost of 858 million, no allowance for expected credit losses, unrealized losses of 264 million, and a fair value of 594 million. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our watch list included 52 securities in an unrealized loss position with an amortized cost of 722 million, no allowance for expected credit losses, unrealized losses of 205 million, and a fair value of 517 million. 
 The watch list excludes structured securities as we have separate processes to evaluate the credit quality on the structured securities. 
 There were 101 and 101 structured securities with a fair value of 500 million and 316 million to which we had potential credit exposure as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our analysis of these structured securities, which included cash flow testing, resulted in allowances for expected credit losses of 62 million and 35 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Exposure to Sovereign Debt and Certain Other Exposures 
 Our investment portfolio had an immaterial amount of direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We have no exposure to investments in Russia or Ukraine and de minimis investments in peripheral countries in the region.

 Derivatives 
 We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties on derivative instruments. We attempt to reduce this credit risk by purchasing such derivative instruments from large, well-established financial institutions. 
 We also hold cash and cash equivalents received from counterparties for derivative instrument collateral, as well as U.S. Government securities pledged as derivative instrument collateral, if our counterparty s net exposures exceed pre-determined thresholds. 
 We are required to pay counterparties the effective federal funds rate each day for cash collateral posted to F G for daily mark to market margin changes. We reduce the negative interest cost associated with cash collateral posted from counterparties under various ISDA agreements by reinvesting derivative cash collateral. This program permits collateral cash received to be invested in short term Treasury securities, bank deposits and commercial paper rated A1/P1, which are included in Cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Total revenues in the Corporate and Other segment increased 15 million, or 20 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 81 million, or 44 , in the nine months ended from the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding period in 2023 is primarily attributable to an increase in valuation associated with our deferred compensation plan assets of 16 million. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding period in 2023 is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in valuations associated with our deferred compensation plan assets of 16 million, increased dividends received from F G of 37 million, and an impairment of cost method investments in the 2023 period of 33 million, partially offset by various immaterial items. The dividends received from F G are eliminated upon consolidation. 
 Personnel costs in the Corporate and Other segment increased 20 million, or 91 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased 24 million, or 26 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023 are primarily attributable to inflationary pressures on salaries expense and the aforementioned increase in valuations associated with our deferred compensation plan assets of 16 million, which increased both revenue and personnel costs. 
 Other operating expenses in the Corporate and Other segment decreased 6 million, or 21 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 9 million, or 10 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023. The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023 are attributable to various immaterial items. 
 There was no change in interest expense in the Corporate and Other segment in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Requirements. Our current cash requirements include personnel costs, operating expenses, claim payments, taxes, payments of interest and principal on our debt, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, and dividends on our common stock. We paid dividends of 0.48 per share in the third quarter of 2024, or approximately 131 million to our common shareholders. On November 6, 2024, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of 0.50 per share, payable on December 31, 2024 , to FNF common shareholders of record as of December 17, 2024 . There are no restrictions on our retained earnings regarding our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, although there are limits on the ability of certain subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, as described below. The declaration of any future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 4,970 million, short term investments of 1,177 million, available capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility of 800 million, and available capacity under the Amended F G Credit agreement of 385 million. On October 4, 2024, F G completed its public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25 Senior Notes due 2034 (the 6.25 F G Notes ). A portion of the net proceeds were used to pay off the outstanding balance of 365 million on its revolving credit facility. F G intends to use the remaining net proceeds of the 6.25 F G Notes offering for general corporate purposes, including the support of organic growth opportunities. On July 18, 2024 F G acquired 100 of PALH, LLC for cash consideration of 215 million. On June 4, 2024, F G completed its public offering of 550 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.50 Senior Notes due 2029 (the 6.50 F G Notes ). A portion of the net proceeds were used to finance a cash tender offer by its wholly owned subsidiary Fidelity Guaranty Life Holdings, Inc. FGLH for an aggregate principal amount of 250 million of FGLH s 5.50 Senior Notes due 2025. F G intends to use the remaining net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include the repurchase, redemption, or repayment at maturity of outstanding indebtedness. On January 2, 2024, F G acquired a 70 majority ownership stake in the equity of Roar. Roar wholesales life insurance and annuity products to banks and broker dealers through a network of agents. Total initial consideration was 269 million. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, F G has agreed to make cash payments of up to 90 million over a three year period upon the achievement of certain earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization milestones of Roar. On February 16, 2024, we entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for our 800 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and other agents party thereto (the "Sixth Restated Credit Agreement"). Among other changes, the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends the Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from October 29, 2025, to February 16, 2029. On February 16, 2024, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated F G Credit Agreement of our 665 million credit agreement, with the guarantors party thereto, the financial institutions party thereto as lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuing bank (the "Second Amended and Restated F G Credit Agreement"). Among other changes, the Second Amended and Restated F G Credit Agreement amends the Amended F G Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date and increase the aggregate principal amount of commitments under the revolving credit facility to 750 million. 
 We continually assess our capital allocation strategy, including decisions relating to the amount of our dividend, reducing debt, repurchasing our stock, investing in growth of our subsidiaries, making acquisitions, and/or conserving cash. We believe that all anticipated cash requirements for current operations will be met from internally generated funds, through cash dividends from subsidiaries, cash generated by investment securities, potential sales of non-strategic assets, potential issuances of additional debt or equity securities, and borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are monitored regularly to ensure that we can meet our cash requirements. We forecast the needs of all of our subsidiaries and periodically review their short-term and long-term projected sources and uses of funds, as well as the asset, liability, investment, and cash flow assumptions underlying such forecasts. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries generate cash from premiums earned and their respective investment portfolios, and these funds are adequate to satisfy the payments of claims and other liabilities. Due to the magnitude of our investment portfolio in relation to our title claim loss reserves, we do not specifically match durations of our investments to the cash outflows required to pay claims, but do manage outflows on a shorter time frame. 
 Our two significant sources of internally generated funds are dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we receive cash from our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and as reimbursement for operating and other administrative expenses we incur. The reimbursements are paid within the guidelines of management agreements among us and our subsidiaries. Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in their ability to pay dividends and make distributions. Each applicable state of domicile regulates the extent to which our title underwriters can pay dividends or make other distributions. As of December 31, 2023, 1,445 million of our net assets were restricted from dividend payments without prior approval from the relevant departments of insurance. We anticipate that our title insurance subsidiaries will pay or make dividends in the remainder of 2024 of approximately 120 million. Our underwritten title companies and non-insurance subsidiaries are not regulated to the same extent as our insurance subsidiaries.

 The maximum dividend permitted by law is not necessarily indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay dividends, which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurer s ratings or competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written, and the ability to pay future dividends. Further, depending on business and regulatory conditions, we may in the future need to retain cash in our underwriters or even contribute cash to one or more of them in order to maintain their ratings or their statutory capital position. Such a requirement could be the result of investment losses, reserve charges, adverse operating conditions in the current economic environment, or changes in statutory accounting requirements by regulators. 
 Cash flow from our operations will be used for general corporate purposes including to reinvest in operations, repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock, pursue other strategic initiatives, and/or conserve cash. 
 Operating Cash Flow . Our cash flows provided by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 5,320 million and 4,215 million, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in the 2024 period of 1,105 million is primarily attributable to increased net cash inflows associated with the change in funds withheld from reinsurers of 477 million, increased net cash inflows associated with the change in future policy benefits of 374 million, and net cash inflows associated with the change in other assets and other liabilities of 360 million in the 2024 period as compared to net cash outflows of 131 million in the 2023 period. 
 Investing Cash Flows. Our cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 5,016 million and 5,760 million, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in the 2024 period of 744 million was primarily attributable to increased cash inflows from proceeds from sales, calls and maturities of investment securities of 3,805 million, and decreased net cash outflows associated with additional investments in unconsolidated affiliates of 158 million, partially offset by increased purchases of investment securities of 1,982 million, decreased cash inflows associated with the net proceeds from sales of short-term investment securities of 899 million, and increased cash outflows associated with acquisitions of 271 million. 
 Capital Expenditures. Total capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software were 116 million and 101 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Financing Cash Flows. Our cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1,899 million and 2,468 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in the 2024 period of 569 million was primarily attributable to increased cash outflows from contractholder withdrawals of 3,310 million and the cash outflow associated with the tender offer of 250 million of the 5.50 F G Notes, partially offset by increased cash inflows from contractholder deposits of 2,856 million. 
 Financing Arrangements. For a description of our financing arrangements see Note G Notes Payable included in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 Capital Stock Transactions . On August 3, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a three-year repurchase program (the "2021 Repurchase Program") under which we were authorized to purchase up to 25 million shares of our FNF common stock through July 31, 2024. Since the commencement of the 2021 Repurchase Program, we repurchased a total of 16,449,565 FNF common shares for approximately 701 million, at an average price of 42.60 per share. On July 31, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new three-year stock repurchase program effective July 31, 2024 (the "2024 Repurchase Program") under which we are authorized to purchase up to 25 million shares of our FNF common stock through July 31, 2027. We did not repurchase any FNF common stock under the 2021 Repurchase Program or the 2024 Repurchase Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Equity and Preferred Security Investments. Our equity and preferred security investments may be subject to significant volatility. Currently prevailing accounting standards require us to record the change in fair value of equity and preferred security investments held as of any given period end within earnings. Our results of operations in future periods is anticipated to be subject to such volatility. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than our unfunded investment commitments discussed below, t here have been no significant changes to our off-balance sheet arrangements since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We have unfunded investment commitments as of September 30, 2024 based upon the timing of when investments are executed compared to when the actual investments are funded, as some investments require that funding occur over a period of months or years. Please refer to Note F Commitments and Contingencies to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on unfunded investment commitments.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is: (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms; and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the "Risk Factors" disclosed under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes as of the date of this report to the risk factors disclosed in Item IA. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business 
 Changes in the Company s dealings with large mortgage lenders, servicers or government-sponsored enterprises could adversely affect our title insurance and mortgage servicing subsidiaries. 
 Large mortgage lenders, servicers and government-sponsored enterprises have significant influence over the products and services provided by our title insurance and mortgage servicing subsidiaries. Changes in our dealings with any of these lenders, servicers or the government-sponsored enterprises, the loss of all or a portion of the business derived from these parties, or revisions to the government-sponsored enterprises Selling or Servicing Guides related to title insurance or mortgage servicing, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Risk Factors Relating to Government Regulation of the Insurance Industry 
 Our subsidiaries must comply with federal and state statutes and regulations. These statutes and regulations may increase our costs, impede our provision of certain products or services, or impose burdensome conditions on actions that we might seek to take to increase the revenues of those subsidiaries, resulting in decreased demand for the Company's products and services or otherwise adversely affecting the Company. 
 Changes to federal and state statutes and regulations; statutory or regulatory guidance, policies, or interpretations of existing regulations or statutes; guidelines published by the government-sponsored enterprises; enhanced federal or state governmental oversight or efforts by federal or state governmental agencies that cause customers to refrain from purchasing or using the Company s products and services, could: (i) prohibit, impact, or limit our future operations, (ii) make it more costly or burdensome to conduct such operations, or (iii) result in decreased demand for the Company s products and services. Such changes could impact our competitive position and have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues, earnings and cash flows. 
 Additionally, our insurance b usinesses are subject to extensive regulation by state insurance authorities in each state in which they operate. These agencies have broad administrative and supervisory power relating to the following, among other matters: 
 licensing requirements; 
 trade and marketing practices; 
 accounting and financing practices; 
 disclosure requirements on key terms of mortgage loans; 
 capital and surplus requirements; 
 the amount of dividends and other payments made by insurance subsidiaries; 
 investment practices; 
 rate schedules; 
 deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; 
 establishing reserves; and 
 regulation of reinsurance. 
 Most states also regulate insurance holding companies like us with respect to acquisitions, changes of control and the terms of transactions with our affiliates. State regulations may impede or impose burdensome conditions on our ability to increase or maintain rate levels or on other actions that we may want to take to enhance our operating results. In addition, we may incur significant costs in the course of complying with regulatory requirements. Further, various state legislatures have in the past considered offering a public alternative to the title industry in their states, as a means to increase state government revenues. Although we think this situation is unlikely, if one or more such takeovers were to occur, they could adversely affect our business. We cannot be assured that future legislative or regulatory changes will not adversely affect our business operations. See Item 1. Business Regulation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion of the current regulatory environment.

 Our ServiceLink subsidiary provides mortgage transaction services including title-related services and facilitation of production and management of mortgage loans. Certain of these businesses are subject to federal and state regulatory oversight. For example, ServiceLink s LoanCare business services and subservices mortgage loans secured primarily by residential real estate throughout the United States. LoanCare is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulatory oversight, including federal and state regulatory examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, and investigations by governmental and regulatory agencies, including the CFPB. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by those agencies, LoanCare receives numerous requests, subpoenas, and orders for documents, testimony, and information in connection with various aspects of its or its clients regulated activities. 
 LoanCare is also required to maintain a variety of licenses, both federal and state. License requirements are in a frequent state of renewal and reexamination as regulations change or are reinterpreted. In addition, federal and state statutes establish specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow when collecting consumer accounts. LoanCare s failure to comply with any of these laws, should the states take an opposing interpretation, could have an adverse effect on LoanCare in the event and to the extent that they apply to some or all of its servicing activities. 
 Our F G segment is highly regulated and subject to numerous legal restrictions and regulations. 
 State insurance regulators, the NAIC and federal regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and may impose changes in the future. New interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies, increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously and adversely affect our profitability and financial strength. We are also subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may not result in compliance with another regulator s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. Regulators and other authorities have the power to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against us, which could result in, among other things, suspension or revocation of our licenses, cease and desist orders, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We cannot predict what form any future changes in these or other areas of regulation affecting the insurance industry might take or what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us if enacted into law. In addition, because our activities are relatively concentrated in a small number of lines of business, any change in law or regulation affecting one of those lines of business could have a disproportionate impact on us as compared to other more diversified insurance companies. See section titled Regulation in Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion of the impact of regulations on our business. 
 State Regulation 
 Our business is subject to government regulation in each of the states in which we conduct business and is concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders and other customers rather than shareholders. Such regulation is vested in state agencies having broad administrative and discretionary authority, which may include, among other things, premium rates and increases thereto, underwriting practices, reserve requirements, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, acquisitions, mergers, and capital adequacy. At any given time, we and our insurance subsidiaries may be the subject of a number of ongoing financial or market conduct, audits or inquiries. From time to time, regulators raise issues during such examinations or audits that could have a material impact on our business. 
 Under insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. We cannot predict the amount or timing of any such future assessments and therefore the liability we have established for these potential assessments may not be adequate. In addition, regulators may change their interpretation or application of existing laws and regulations such as the case with broadening the scope of carriers that must contribute towards Long Term Care insolvencies. 
 NAIC 
 Although our business is subject to regulation in each state in which we conduct business, in many instances the state regulatory models emanate from the NAIC. Some of the NAIC pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting issues, take effect automatically in the various states without affirmative action by the states. Statutes, regulations and interpretations may be applied with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting and reserve requirements. The NAIC continues to work to reform state regulation in various areas, including comprehensive reforms relating to cybersecurity regulations, best interest standards, RBC and life insurance reserves. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capitalization requirements based on RBC formulas for life insurance companies that establish capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset, interest rate and certain other risks. Changes to statutory reserve or risk-based capital requirements may increase the amount of reserves or capital our insurance companies are required to hold and may impact our ability to pay dividends. In addition, changes in statutory reserve or risk-based capital requirements may adversely impact our financial strength ratings. Changes currently under consideration include adding an operational risk component, factors for asset credit risk, and group wide capital calculations.

 Fiduciary Rule 
 In December 2020, the DOL issued its final version of an investment advice rule replacing the previous Fiduciary Rule that had been challenged by industry participants and vacated in March 2018 by the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The new investment advice rule reinstates the five-part test for determining whether a person is considered a fiduciary for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and sets forth a new exemption, referred to as prohibited transaction class exemption PTE 2020-02. The rule s preamble also contains the DOL s reinterpretation of elements of the five-part test that appears to encompass more insurance agents selling IRA products and withdraws the DOL s longstanding position that rollover recommendations out of employer plans are not subject to ERISA. The new rule took effect on February 16, 2021. The DOL left in place PTE 84-24, which is a longstanding class exemption providing prohibited transaction relief for insurance agents selling annuity products, provided that certain disclosures are made to the plan fiduciary, which is the policyholder in the case of an IRA, and certain other conditions are met. Among other things, these disclosures include the agent s relationship to the insurer and commissions received in connection with the annuity sale. F G, along with FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance, designed and launched a compliance program in January 2022 requiring all agents selling IRA products to submit an acknowledgment with each IRA application indicating the agent has satisfied PTE 84-24 requirements on a precautionary basis in case the agent acted or is found to have acted as a fiduciary. Meanwhile, the DOL has publicly announced its intention to consider future rulemaking that may revoke or modify PTE 84-24. 
 On April 23, 2024, following previous attempts to expand fiduciary regulation for advisers, the DOL released a new rule, the New Fiduciary Rule, which significantly broadens the definition of fiduciary under ERISA and Section 4975 when advisers provide investment recommendations to plans subject to ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Among other requirements, the New Fiduciary Rule provides that any person will be an investment advice fiduciary such person provides investment advice or makes an investment recommendation to a retirement investor (i.e., a plan, a discretionary plan fiduciary, a plan participant or beneficiary, an IRA, an IRA owner or beneficiary, or an IRA fiduciary) for a fee or other compensation, the person makes professional investment recommendations to investors on a regular basis as part of their business, and the recommendation is provided under circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable investor in like circumstances that the recommendation is based on a review of the particular needs or individual investor circumstances of the retirement investor, reflects the application of professional or expert judgment to the retirement investor s particular needs or individual circumstances, and may be relied upon by the retirement investor as intended to advance the retirement investor s best interest. Unlike the current ERISA standard, the New Fiduciary Rule subjects non-discretionary investment advice to retirement plans and accounts care and loyalty standards that also apply to investment advisors with discretionary authority or control over such plans and accounts. In addition, on the same date, the DOL issued amended versions of PTE 2020-02 and PTE 84-24, either or both of which provide prohibited transaction exemptive relief to insurance companies and insurance producers who make insurance product recommendations to retirement investors, subject to certain conditions. The New Fiduciary Rule likely means that certain of the Company s agents will be considered fiduciaries for purposes of ERISA and the Code, subjecting the Company, and the insurance industry on the whole, to greater regulatory risk. 
 The DOL s new Fiduciary Rule, which was scheduled to become effective on September 23, 2024, has been challenged. On July 25, 2024, in the case of Federation of Americans for Consumer Choice, Inc., et al. v. United States Department of Labor, et al. , Federation of Americans the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued an order staying the effective date of the DOL s final fiduciary rule (and related amendments to PTE 84-14) that was issued in March 2024. The District Court, in part relying on the Supreme Court s recent ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo , found that the plaintiffs (primarily insurance agents) were likely to succeed on their arguments that the Final Rule improperly expanded the definition of an investment advice fiduciary under ERISA. As a result, the Final Rule s original effective date of September 23, 2024 has been delayed until further notice. 
 In addition, on July 26, 2024, a companion case to Federation of Americans filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, American Council of Life Insurers, et al. v. United States Dep t of Labor, et al. , held the remaining PTE amendments included in the Final Rule (PTEs 2020-02, 75-1, 77-4, 80-83, 83-1 and 86-128) that were not challenged in Federation of Americans were also stayed, noting that the Northern District fully agreed with the Eastern District s analysis and decision to stay the effective date of the Final Rule. 
 The DOL appealed both rulings to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 Management believes these current and emerging developments relating to market conduct standards for the financial services industry may, over time, materially affect the way in which our agents do business, the role of IMOs, sale of IRA products including IRA-to-IRA and employer plan rollovers, how we supervise our distribution force, compensation practices, and liability exposure and costs. In addition to implementing the compliance procedures described above, management is monitoring further developments closely and will be working with IMOs and distributors to adapt to these evolving regulatory requirements and risks.

 Bermuda and Cayman Islands Regulation 
 Our business is subject to regulation in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, including the BMA and the CIMA. These regulations may limit or curtail our activities, including activities that might be profitable, and changes to existing regulations may affect our ability to continue to offer our existing products and services, or new products and services we may wish to offer in the future. 
 Our reinsurance subsidiary, F G Life Re, is registered in Bermuda under the Bermuda Insurance Act and subject to the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The BMA has sought regulatory equivalency, which enables Bermuda s commercial insurers to transact business with the European Union on a level playing field. In connection with its initial efforts to achieve equivalency under the European Union s Directive (2009/138/EC) Solvency II ), the BMA implemented and imposed additional requirements on the companies it regulates. The European Commission in 2016 granted Bermuda s commercial insurers full equivalence in all areas of Solvency II for an indefinite period of time. 
 Our reinsurance subsidiary, F G Cayman Re, is licensed in the Cayman Islands by the CIMA and is subject to supervision by CIMA and CIMA may at any time direct F G Cayman Re, in relation to a policy, a line of business or the entire business, to cease or refrain from committing an act or pursing a course of conduct and to perform such acts as in the opinion of CIMA are necessary to remedy or ameliorate the situation.
