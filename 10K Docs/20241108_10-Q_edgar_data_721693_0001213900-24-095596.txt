on income reported in the statutory financial statements after appropriate tax adjustments. Under Chinese
tax law, the tax treatment of finance and sales-type leases is similar to US GAAP. However, the local tax bureau continues to treat the
Company s sales-type leases as operating leases. Accordingly, the Company recorded deferred income taxes.

US parent company, SPC is taxed in the US and, as of June 30, 2024, had net operating loss NOL carry forwards for
income taxes of million; for federal income tax purposes, the NOL arising in tax years beginning after 2017 may only reduce 
of a taxpayer s taxable income, and may be carried forward indefinitely. However, the coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security
Act the CARES Act issued in March 2020, provides tax relief to both corporate and noncorporate taxpayers by adding a
five-year carryback period and temporarily repealing the limitation for NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Management believes
the realization of benefits from these losses uncertain due to the US parent company s continuing operating losses. Accordingly,
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance was provided.

income for from the year the loss is incurred. The NOL was mostly from Erdos TCH and Zhonghong. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.

realization of the deferred tax assets due to the recurring losses from operations of these entities, accordingly, the Company recorded
a deferred tax valuation allowance for the PRC NOL.

OVERVIEW 

The
Company was incorporated on May 8, 1980 as Boulder Brewing Company under the laws of the State of Colorado. On September 6, 2001, the
Company changed its state of incorporation to the State of Nevada. In 2004, the Company changed its name from Boulder Brewing Company

The
Company is in the process of transforming and expanding into an energy storage integrated solution provider business. We plan to pursue
disciplined and targeted expansion strategies for market areas we currently do not serve. We actively seek and explore opportunities
to apply energy storage technologies to new industries or segments with high growth potential, including industrial and commercial complexes,
large scale photovoltaic PV and wind power stations, remote islands without electricity, and cities with multi-energy
supplies.

Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds on reasonable
terms and conditions, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern depends upon
the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional
funds by way of a public or private offering, or debt financing including bank loans.

The
Company s organizational chart as of September 30, 2024 is as follows: 

Erdos
TCH Joint Venture 

On
April 14, 2009, the Company formed a joint venture (the JV with Erdos Metallurgy Co., Ltd. Erdos to recycle
waste heat from Erdos metal refining plants to generate power and steam to be sold back to Erdos. The name of the JV was Inner
Mongolia Erdos TCH Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd. Erdos TCH with a term of 20 years. Erdos contributed 7 
of the total investment of the project, and Xi an TCH Energy Technology Co., Ltd. Xi an TCH contributed 93 .
On June 15, 2013, Xi an TCH and Erdos entered into a share transfer agreement, pursuant to which Erdos sold its 7 ownership
interest in the JV to Xi an TCH for 1.29 million (RMB 8 million), plus certain accumulated profits. Xi an
TCH paid 1.29 million in July 2013 and, as a result, became the sole stockholder of the JV. Erdos TCH currently has two power generation
systems in Phase I with a total of 18 MW power capacity, and three power generation systems in Phase II with a total of 27 MW power capacity.
On April 28, 2016, Erdos TCH and Erdos entered into a supplemental agreement, effective May 1, 2016, whereby Erdos TCH cancelled monthly
minimum lease payments from Erdos, and started to charge Erdos based on actual electricity sold at RMB 0.30 / KWH. The selling price
of each KWH is determined annually based on prevailing market conditions. In May 2019, Erdos TCH ceased its operations due to renovations
and furnace safety upgrades of Erdos, and the Company initially expected the resumption of operations in July 2020, but the resumption
of operations was further delayed due to government s mandate for Erdos to significantly lower its energy consumption per unit
of GDP by implementing a comprehensive technical upgrade of its ferrosilicon production line to meet the City s energy-saving targets. Erdos
is currently researching the technical rectification scheme. Once the scheme is determined, Erdos TCH will carry out supporting technical
transformation for its waste heat power station project. During this period, Erdos will compensate Erdos TCH RMB 1 million 145,460)
per month, until operations resume. The Company has not recognized any income due to the uncertainty of collection. 

In
addition, Erdos TCH has 30 ownership in DaTangShiDai (BinZhou) Energy Savings Technology Co., Ltd. BinZhou Energy Savings ), 30 
ownership in DaTangShiDai DaTong Recycling Energy Technology Co., Ltd. DaTong Recycling Energy ), and 40 ownership
in DaTang ShiDai TianYu XuZhou Recycling Energy Technology Co, Ltd. TianYu XuZhou Recycling Energy ). These companies were
incorporated in 2012 but have not had any operations since then nor has any registered capital contribution been made.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
statements CFS ), which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America US GAAP ). The preparation of these CFS requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as
well as the reported net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions.
We base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our CFS, we believe the following accounting policies are the
most critical to assist you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis. 

Basis
of Presentation 

These
accompanying CFS were prepared in accordance with US GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for financial statements. 

Principle
of Consolidation 

The
CFS include the accounts of CREG and, its subsidiary, Sifang Holdings and Yinghua; Sifang Holdings wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Huahong and Shanghai TCH; Shanghai TCH s wholly-owned subsidiary Xi an TCH; and Xi an TCH s subsidiaries, Erdos
TCH, Zhonghong, and Zhongxun. Substantially all of the Company s revenues are derived from the operations of Shanghai TCH and its
subsidiaries, which represent substantially all of the Company s consolidated assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024.
All significant inter-company accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation. 

Use
of Estimates 

In
preparing the CFS, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance
sheets as well as revenues and expenses during the year reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Concentration
of Credit Risk 

Cash
includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained within China. Balances at financial institutions within China are not
covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. 

Certain
other financial instruments, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist of accounts and other receivables. The
Company does not require collateral or other security to support these receivables. The Company conducts periodic reviews of its customers 
financial condition and customer payment practices to minimize collection risk on accounts receivable. 

The
operations of the Company are located in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations
may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in the PRC. 

27 

Revenue
Recognition 

Sales-type
Leasing and Related Revenue Recognition 

The
Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic
842 (See Operating lease below as relates to the Company as a lessee). The Company s sales type lease contracts for revenue recognition
fall under ASC 842. 

The
Company constructs and leases waste energy recycling power generating projects to its customers. The Company typically transfers ownership
of the waste energy recycling power generating projects to its customers at the end of the lease. 

The
Company finances construction of waste energy recycling power generating projects. The sales and cost of sales are recognized at the
inception of the lease, which is when the control is transferred to the lessee. The Company accounts for the transfer of control as a
sales type lease in accordance with ASC 842-10-25-2. The underlying asset is derecognized, and revenue is recorded when collection of
payments is probable. This is in accordance with the revenue recognition principle in ASC 606 -Revenue from contracts with customers.
The investment in sales-type leases consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable less unearned interest income and estimated
executory cost. Minimum lease payments are part of the lease agreement between the Company (as the lessor) and the customer (as the lessee).
The discount rate implicit in the lease is used to calculate the present value of minimum lease payments. The minimum lease payments
consist of the gross lease payments net of executory costs and contingent rentals, if any. Unearned interest is amortized to income over
the lease term to produce a constant periodic rate of return on net investment in the lease. While revenue is recognized at the inception
of the lease, the cash flow from the sales-type lease occurs over the course of the lease, which results in interest income and reduction
of receivables. Revenue is recognized net of value-added tax. 

Contingent
Rental Income 

The
Company records income from actual electricity generated of each project in the period the income is earned, which is when the electricity
is generated. Contingent rent is not part of minimum lease payments. 

Foreign
Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

The
Company s functional currency is RMB. For financial reporting purposes, RMB figures were translated into USD as the reporting currency.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated
at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange
rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in income. There has been no significant fluctuation in exchange rate
for the conversion of RMB to USD after the balance sheet date. 

The
Company uses Reporting Comprehensive Income (codified in FASB ASC Topic 220). Comprehensive income is comprised of net
income and all changes to the statements of stockholders equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in
capital and distributions to stockholders.

increased loss on note conversion by 21,823, decreased other income by 268,534, and decreased interest income by 109,745, which was
partly offset by decreased interest expense by 24,349 and decreased income tax expense by 82,972 as described above.

On June 19, 2023, the Company entered a purchase

and management until repayment of the loan. The Company received the repayment of 68.7 million in full plus capital utilization
fee in January 2024.

We
do not believe inflation has had or will have a significant negative impact on our results of operations in 2024. 

Transfers
of Cash to and from Our Subsidiaries 

The
PRC has currency and capital transfer regulations that require us to comply with certain requirements for the movement of capital. The
Company is able to transfer cash (USD) to its PRC subsidiaries through: (i) an investment (by increasing the Company s registered
capital in a PRC subsidiary), or (ii) a stockholder loan. The Company s subsidiaries in the PRC have not transferred any earnings
or cash to the Company to date. The Company s business is primarily conducted through its subsidiaries. The Company is a holding
company and its material assets consist solely of the ownership interests held in its PRC subsidiaries. The Company relies on dividends
paid by its subsidiaries for its working capital and cash needs, including the funds necessary: (i) to pay dividends or cash distributions
to its stockholders, (ii) to service any debt obligations and (iii) to pay operating expenses. As a result of PRC laws and regulations
(noted below) that require annual appropriations of 10 of after-tax income to be set aside in a general reserve fund prior to payment
of dividends, the Company s PRC subsidiaries are restricted in that respect, as well as in others respects noted below, in their
ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company as a dividend. 

With
respect to transferring cash from the Company to its subsidiaries, increasing the Company s registered capital in a PRC subsidiary
requires the filing of the local commerce department, while a stockholder loan requires a filing with the state administration of foreign
exchange or its local bureau. 

With
respect to the payment of dividends, we note the following: 

1. 
 PRC
 regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, as determined in accordance with accounting
 standards and PRC regulations (an in-depth description of the PRC regulations is set forth below); 

31 

2. 
 Our
 PRC subsidiaries are required to set aside, at a minimum, 10 of their net income after taxes, based on PRC accounting standards,
 each year as statutory surplus reserves until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50 of their registered capital; 

3. 
 Such
 reserves may not be distributed as cash dividends; 

4. 
 Our
 PRC subsidiaries may also allocate a portion of their after-tax profits to fund their staff welfare and bonus funds; except in the
 event of a liquidation, these funds may also not be distributed to stockholders; the Company does not participate in a Common Welfare
 Fund; 

5. 
 The
 incurrence of debt, specifically the instruments governing such debt, may restrict a subsidiary s ability to pay stockholder
 dividends or make other cash distributions; and 

6. 
 The
 Company is subject to covenants and consent requirements. 

If,
for the reasons noted above, our subsidiaries are unable to pay stockholder dividends and/or make other cash payments to the Company
when needed, the Company s ability to conduct operations, make investments, engage in acquisitions, or undertake other activities
requiring working capital may be materially and adversely affected. However, our operations and business, including investment and/or
acquisitions by our subsidiaries within China, will not be affected as long as the capital is not transferred in or out of the PRC. 

PRC
Regulations 

In
accordance with PRC regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment and their articles of association, a foreign-invested enterprise FIE established in the PRC is required to provide statutory reserves, which are appropriated from net profit, as reported
in the FIE s PRC statutory accounts. A FIE is required to allocate at least 10 of its annual after-tax profit to the surplus reserve
until such reserve has reached 50 of its respective registered capital (based on the FIE s PRC statutory accounts). The aforementioned
reserves may only be used for specific purposes and may not be distributed as cash dividends. Until such contribution of capital is satisfied,
the FIE is not allowed to repatriate profits to its stockholders, unless approved by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. After
satisfaction of this requirement, the remaining funds may be appropriated at the discretion of the FIE s board of directors. Our
subsidiary, Shanghai TCH, qualifies as a FIE and is therefore subject to the above-mandated regulations on distributable profits. 

Additionally,
in accordance with PRC corporate law, a domestic enterprise is required to maintain a surplus reserve of at least 10 of its annual after-tax
profit until such reserve has reached 50 of its respective registered capital based on the enterprise s PRC statutory accounts.
The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and may not be distributed as cash dividends. Xi an TCH, Huahong,
Zhonghong and Erdos TCH were established as domestic enterprises; therefore, each is subject to the above-mentioned restrictions on distributable
profits. 

As
a result of PRC laws and regulations that require annual appropriations of 10 of after-tax income to be set aside, prior to payment
of dividends, in a general reserve fund, the Company s PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of
their net assets to the Company as a dividend or otherwise. 

Chart
of the Company s Statutory Reserve 

Pursuant
to PRC corporate law, effective January 1, 2006, the Company is required to maintain a statutory reserve by appropriating from its after-tax
profit before declaration or payment of dividends. The statutory reserve is restricted retained earnings. Our restricted and unrestricted
retained earnings under US GAAP are set forth below:

Company believes it has sufficient cash as of September 30, 2024, and a sufficient channel to commercial institutions to obtain any loans
that may be necessary to meet its working capital needs. Historically, we have been able to obtain loans or otherwise achieve our financing
objectives due to the Chinese government s support for energy-saving businesses with stable cash inflows, good credit ratings and
history. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Exchange
Rate Risk 

Our
operations are conducted mainly in the PRC. As such, our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions
are denominated in RMB, which is our functional currency. Accordingly, our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange
rate between the U.S. dollar and those currencies. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed in the Company s periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s management,
with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ),
has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules
13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act at the end of the period covered by the
report. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

With
the participation of the Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, the Company also conducted an evaluation of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended as
of September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Based on such evaluation, management concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, there
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting
will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls
is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to
future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the
degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

1A. Risk Factors 

There
have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and

company, you should consider carefully all of the risk factors described in our most recent Form 10-K and the registration statement
as referenced above. If any of those risks, incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q, occur, the market price of our shares of common
stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing
us and there may be additional matters that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial. All of these could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in our company.
