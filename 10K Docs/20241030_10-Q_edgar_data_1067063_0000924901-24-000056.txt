EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of Veris Residential, Inc. and Veris Residential, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to the Operating Partnership mean Veris Residential, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and references to the General Partner mean Veris Residential, Inc., a Maryland corporation and real estate investment trust REIT ), and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. References to the Company, "Veris," we, us and our mean collectively the General Partner, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries consolidated by the General Partner. 
 The Operating Partnership conducts the business of providing management, leasing, acquisition, development and tenant-related services for its General Partner. The Operating Partnership, through its operating divisions and subsidiaries, including the Veris property-owning partnerships and limited liability companies, is the entity through which all of the General Partner s operations are conducted. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the General Partner owned an approximate 91.5 percent common unit interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximate 8.5 percent common unit interest is owned by limited partners. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership are (1) persons who contributed their interests in properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for common units (each, a Common Unit or preferred units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership or (2) recipients of long term incentive plan units of the Operating Partnership pursuant to the General Partner s executive compensation plans. 
 A Common Unit of the Operating Partnership and a share of common stock of the General Partner (the Common Stock have substantially the same economic characteristics in as much as they effectively share equally in the net income or loss of the Company. The General Partner owns a number of common units of the Operating Partnership equal to the number of issued and outstanding shares of the General Partner s common stock. Common unitholders (other than the General Partner) have the right to redeem their Common Units, subject to certain restrictions under the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, as amended (the Partnership Agreement and agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance . The redemption is required to be satisfied in shares of Common Stock of the General Partner, cash, or a combination thereof, calculated as follows: one share of the General Partner s Common Stock, or cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the General Partner s Common Stock at the time of redemption, for each Common Unit. The General Partner, in its sole discretion, determines the form of redemption of Common Units (i.e., whether a common unitholder receives Common Stock of the General Partner, cash, or any combination thereof). If the General Partner elects to satisfy the redemption with shares of Common Stock of the General Partner as opposed to cash, the General Partner is obligated to issue shares of its Common Stock to the redeeming unitholder. Regardless of the rights described above, the common unitholders may not put their units for cash to the Company or the General Partner under any circumstances. With each such redemption, the General Partner s percentage ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase. In addition, whenever the General Partner issues shares of its Common Stock other than to acquire Common Units, the General Partner must contribute any net proceeds it receives to the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership must issue to the General Partner an equivalent number of Common Units. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. 
 The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the General Partner and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits: 
 enhance investors understanding of the General Partner and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business of the Company; 
 eliminate duplicative disclosure and provide a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the General Partner and the Operating Partnership; and 
 create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between the General Partner and the Operating Partnership in the context of how they operate as a consolidated company. The financial results of the Operating Partnership are consolidated into the financial statements of the General Partner. The General Partner does not have any significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its interests in the Operating Partnership, nor does the Operating Partnership have employees of its own. The Operating Partnership, not the General Partner, generally executes all

Table of Contents 

significant business relationships other than transactions involving the securities of the General Partner. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the General Partner, including ownership interests in joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity offerings by the General Partner, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in consideration of common or preferred units in the Operating Partnership, as applicable, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company s business. These sources include working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities, and proceeds received from the disposition of properties and joint ventures. 
 Shareholders equity, partners capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the General Partner and the Operating Partnership. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements as is the General Partner s interest in the Operating Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership s financial statements comprise the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships and development joint venture partners. The noncontrolling interests in the General Partner s financial statements are the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership s level and include limited partners of the Operating Partnership. The differences between shareholders equity and partners capital result from differences in the equity issued at the General Partner and Operating Partnership levels. 
 To help investors better understand the key differences between the General Partner and the Operating Partnership, certain information for the General Partner and the Operating Partnership in this report has been separated, as set forth below: 
 Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited), which includes the following specific disclosures for Veris Residential, Inc. and Veris Residential, L.P.:

 and percent common unit interest in the Operating Partnership as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company owns, operates and develops multifamily rental properties located primarily in the Northeast, as well as a portfolio of non-strategic land and commercial assets. The Company is focused on conducting business in a socially, ethically, and environmentally responsible manner, while seeking to maximize value for all stakeholders. Veris Residential, Inc. was incorporated on May 24, 1994. 
 Unless stated otherwise or the context requires, the Company refers to the General Partner and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned or had interests in multifamily rental properties, as well as non-core assets comprised of parking/retail properties, plus developable land (collectively, the "Properties"). The Properties are comprised of: (a) wholly-owned or Company-controlled properties comprised of multifamily properties and non-core assets, and (b) properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has investment interests, including multifamily properties and non-core asset. The Properties are located in states in the Northeast, plus the District of Columbia. 
 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all accounts of the Company, including its controlled subsidiaries, which consist principally of the Operating Partnership and variable interest entities for which the Company has determined itself to be the primary beneficiary, if any. The portions of equity in consolidated subsidiaries that are not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us are presented as noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 to the 2023 10-K: Significant Accounting Policies Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, for the Company s treatment of unconsolidated joint venture interests. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
 The Company consolidates variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary. VIEs are entities in which the equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their endeavors without additional financial support or that the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company continuously assesses its determination of the primary beneficiary for each entity and assesses reconsideration events that may cause a change in the original determinations. The Operating Partnership is considered a VIE of the parent company, Veris Residential, Inc. As the Operating Partnership is already consolidated in the balance sheets of Veris Residential, Inc., this has no impact on the consolidated financial statements of Veris Residential, Inc. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s investments in consolidated real estate joint ventures, which are variable interest entities in which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, have total real estate assets of million and million, respectively, other assets of million and million, respectively, mortgages of million and million, respectively, and other liabilities of million and million, respectively. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

The fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of the mortgage debt was determined by discounting the future contractual interest and principal payments by a market rate. 
 Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivative financial

 EARNINGS PER SHARE/UNIT 
 Basic EPS or EPU excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders or unitholders by the weighted average number of shares or units outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS or EPU reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. In the calculation of basic and diluted EPS and EPU, a redemption value adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interests attributable to common shareholders or unitholders is included in the calculation to arrive at the numerator of net income (loss) available to common shareholders or unitholders.

 Pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation, on the accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests and changes in ownership interests of a subsidiary, changes in a parent s ownership interest (and transactions with noncontrolling interests unitholders in the subsidiary) while the parent retains its controlling interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying value of the noncontrolling interests shall be adjusted to reflect the change in its ownership interest in the subsidiary, with the offset to equity attributable to the parent. Accordingly, as a result of equity transactions which caused changes in ownership percentages between Veris Residential, Inc. stockholders equity and noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has decreased noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and increased additional paid-in capital in Veris Residential, Inc. stockholders equity by approximately thousand as of September 30, 2024.

 common units for common shares, at their fair value of thousand. 
 Certain individuals and entities own common units in the Operating Partnership. A common unit and a share of Common Stock of the General Partner have substantially the same economic characteristics in as much as they effectively share equally in the net income or loss of the Operating Partnership. Common unitholders have the right to redeem their common units, subject to certain restrictions. The redemption is required to be satisfied in shares of Common Stock, cash, or a combination thereof, calculated as follows: share of the General Partner s Common Stock, or cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the General Partner s Common Stock at the time of redemption, for each common unit. The General Partner, in its sole discretion, determines the form of redemption of common units (i.e., whether a common unitholder receives Common Stock, cash, or any combination thereof). If the General Partner elects to satisfy the redemption with shares of Common Stock as opposed to cash, it is obligated to issue shares of its Common Stock to the redeeming unitholder. Regardless of the rights described above, the common unitholders may not put their units for cash to the General Partner or the Operating Partnership under any circumstances. When a unitholder redeems a common unit, noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership is reduced and Veris Residential, Inc. Stockholders equity is increased. 
 LTIP Units 
 After LTIP Units are fully vested, LTIP Units may be converted on a -for-one basis into common units. Common units in turn have a -for-one relationship in value with shares of the General Partner s common stock, and are redeemable on a -for-one basis for cash or, at the election of the Company, shares of the General Partner s common stock. As of September 30, 2024, there are no unvested LTIP Units. 
 Noncontrolling Interests Ownership in Operating Partnership 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the noncontrolling interests common unit and LTIP units holders owned percent and percent of the Operating Partnership, respectively. 
 NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES (applicable to General Partner and Operating Partnership) 
 The Company consolidates certain joint ventures in which it has ownership interests. Various entities and/or individuals hold noncontrolling interests in these ventures. 
 PARTICIPATION RIGHTS 
 The Company s interests in a potential future development provides for the initial distributions of net cash flow solely to the Company, and thereafter, other parties have participation rights in percent of the excess net cash flow remaining after the distribution to the Company of the aggregate amount equal to the sum of: (a) the Company s capital contributions, plus (b) an IRR of percent per annum.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Veris Residential, Inc. and Veris Residential, L.P. and the notes thereto (collectively, the Financial Statements ). Certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Financial Statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are subject to change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. Certain accounting policies, while significant, may not require the use of estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Impairment 
 On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period, and general market conditions, that the value of the Company s rental properties held for use may be impaired. A p roperty s value is considered impaired when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying value. If there are different potential outcomes for a property, the Company will take a probability weighted approach to estimating future cash flows. To the extent impairment has occurred, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property. Estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates. In addition, such cash flow models consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. 
 
 The Company generally considers assets (as identified by their disposal groups) to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority, it is probable that the disposition will occur within one year and there are no significant contingencies relating to a sale. When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value. If the fair value of the assets, less estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying value of the assets, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recognized and recorded within the Unrealized gains (losses) on disposition of rental property to reflect the estimated fair value of the assets. The Company will continue to review the property for subsequent changes in the fair value, and may recognize an additional impairment charge, if warranted. 
 
 In addition, on a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including the underlying investment property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the Company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. Estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates. 
 These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as certain disclosures in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that would duplicate those included in the 10-K are not included in these financial statements.

 Property management. Property management includes expenses associated with the self-management of the Company's properties as well as administrative and personnel expenses for the Company's third-party/joint venture management businesses.

See Note 12: Commitments and Contingencies to the Financial Statements. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 5.4 million, or 15.8 percent, due to higher stock compensation expense in 2023 as a result of the previously mentioned 2.8 million adjustment, additional stock compensation expense due to the realization of outperformance grants recorded during 2023, and higher severance and related costs in 2023, partially offset by the satisfaction of stay-on award conditions in 2024.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 Overview 
 Liquidity is a measurement of the Company's ability to meet cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, pay dividends, fund acquisitions of real estate assets and other general business needs. In addition to cash on hand, the primary sources of funds for short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including working capital, distributions, debt service and additional investments, consist of: (i) borrowings under the revolving credit facility; (ii) proceeds from sales of real estate; and (iv) cash flow from operations. The Company believe these sources of financing will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. 
 The Company's cash flow from operations primarily consists of rental revenue which is the principal source of funds that is used to pay operating expenses, debt service, general and administrative expenses, operating capital expenditures, dividends, and transaction-related expenses. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements generally through its working capital, which may include proceeds from the sales of rental properties and land, net cash provided by operating activities and draws from its revolving credit facility. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 22.1 million to 32.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 54.6 million at December 31, 2023. This decrease is comprised of the following net cash flow items: 
 (1) 40.5 million provided by operating activities. 
 (2) 165.0 million provided by investing activities, consisting primarily of the following: 
 (a) 89.0 million received from proceeds from the sales of developable land; 
 (b) 77.2 million received from proceeds of rental properties included in discontinued operations; 
 (c) 8.6 million received from distributions in excess of cumulative earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures; 
 (d) 6.1 million received from proceeds from the sale of investments in joint ventures; 
 (e) 11.1 million used for additions to rental property, improvements and other costs; and 
 (f) 4.7 million used for the development of rental property and other related costs. 
 (3) 227.6 million used in financing activities, consisting primarily of the following: 
 (a) 533.3 million used for repayments of mortgages, loans payable and other obligations; 
 (b) 16.9 million used for the payment of common dividends and distributions; 
 (c) 15.7 million used for the redemption of redeemable noncontrolling interests; 
 (d) 14.4 million used for payment of financing and derivative premium costs; 
 (e) 1.7 million used for distribution to noncontrolling interests; 
 (f) 0.5 million used for distribution to redeemable noncontrolling interests; 
 (g) 200.0 million received from the borrowings from term loans; 
 (h) 157.0 million received from the borrowings from the revolving credit facility; and 
 (i) 1.8 million received from share issuance proceeds, net. 
 
 To maintain its qualification as a REIT under the IRS Code, the General Partner must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90 percent of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains. However, any such distributions, whether for federal income tax purposes or otherwise, would be paid out of available cash, including borrowings and other sources, after meeting operating requirements, preferred stock dividends and distributions, and scheduled debt service on the Company s debt. If and to the extent the Company retains and does not distribute any net capital gains, the General Partner will be required to pay federal, state and local taxes on such net capital gains at the rate applicable to capital gains of a corporation. 
 The Board of Directors considers a variety of factors when setting the Company's dividends including the Company s earnings, income tax projections, cash flows, financial condition, capital requirements, debt maturities, the availability of

 debt and equity capital, applicable REIT and legal restrictions and the general overall economic conditions and other factors.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Unconsolidated Joint Venture Debt 
 The debt of the Company s unconsolidated joint ventures generally provides for recourse to the Company for customary matters such as intentional misuse of funds, environmental conditions and material misrepresentations. The Company may agree to guarantee repayment of a portion of the debt of its unconsolidated joint ventures. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance of such debt which was guaranteed by the Company. 
 The Company s off-balance sheet arrangements are further discussed in Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures to the Financial Statements. 
 
 Funds from Operations 
 Funds from operations FFO (available to common stock and unit holders) is defined as net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from depreciable rental property transactions (including both acquisitions and dispositions), and impairments related to depreciable rental property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. The Company further believes that as FFO excludes the effect of depreciation, gains (or losses) from property transactions and impairments related to depreciable rental property (all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance), FFO can facilitate comparison of operating performance between equity REITs. 
 FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders as an indication of the Company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. However, the Company s FFO is comparable to the FFO of real estate companies that use the current definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). 
 As the Company considers its primary earnings measure, net income available to common shareholders, as defined by GAAP, to be the most comparable earnings measure to FFO, the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to FFO, as calculated in accordance with NAREIT s current definition, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in thousands ): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss available to common shareholders (9,692) (54,807) (10,673) (102,214) Add (deduct): Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership (923) (5,243) (1,293) (9,785) Noncontrolling interests in discontinued operations 18 42 295 (134) Real estate-related depreciation and amortization on continuing operations (a) 23,401 23,746 68,547 72,087 Real estate-related depreciation and amortization on discontinued operations 1,926 668 10,870 Continuing operations: Gain on sale from unconsolidated joint ventures (7,100) Discontinued operations: Realized (gains) losses and unrealized (gains) losses on disposition of rental property, net (423) (1,548) 2,286 Funds from operations available to common stock and Operating Partnership unitholders (b) 12,804 (34,759) 48,896 (26,890)

 Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from its indebtedness primarily from changes in market interest rates. The Company monitors interest rate risk as an integral part of its overall risk management. The Company manages its exposure 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 to interest rate risk by utilizing fixed rate indebtedness or by hedging the majority of its floating rate indebtedness with interest rate swaps or caps, as appropriate. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's indebtedness with an aggregate principal balance of 1.7 billion had an estimated aggregate fair value of 1.7 billion. 
 Changes in interest rates impact the fair value of the Company's fixed rate debt instruments, computed using current market yields. Approximately 1.1 billion of the Company s long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average coupon of 4.62 and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. If market rates of interest increased or decreased by 100 basis points, the fair value of the Company s fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2024 would be approximately 32.9 million higher or lower, respectively. 
 The effective interest rates on the Company s 591.5 million variable rate debt hedged by interest-rate caps, as of September 30, 2024 ranged from SOFR plus 141 basis points to SOFR plus 275 basis points. Additionally, the effective interest rate on the Company s 7.0 million variable rate debt, which is not hedged by interest-rate caps, as of September 30, 2024 was SOFR plus 271 basis points. Assuming interest-rate caps are not in effect as of September 30, 2024, if market rates of interest on the Company s variable rate debt increased or decreased by 100 basis points, then the increase or decrease in interest costs on the Company s variable rate debt would be approximately 6.0 million annually. 
 The following table presents principal cash flows (in thousands) based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and the related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed rate debt.

 While the Company has not experienced any significant credit losses, in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or economic downturn, tenant vacancies or defaults could increase and result in losses to the Company which could adversely affect its operating results and liquidity, including its ability to pay its debt obligations.
