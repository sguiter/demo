 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Quarterly Report") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of present and historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including without limitation, statements regarding the anticipated timing, benefits and costs associated with the Merger Agreement and Merger-Related Transactions (as defined below), our expectations surrounding the Merger Agreement and Merger-Related Transactions and their ability to maximize shareholder value, our expectations regarding strategic transactions, our expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, prospects, assumptions, future events or expected performance, are forward-looking statements. 
 Without limiting the foregoing, you can generally identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms "aim," "anticipate," "believe," "could," "mission," "may," "will," "should," "expect," "intend," "plan," "estimate," "project," "target," "predict," "potential," "contemplate," or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology and expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions and are based on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to: 
 risks related to the Merger Agreement and Merger-Related Transactions; 

changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences and industry trends; 

impacts from changes in discretionary and corporate spending on entertainment and sports events due to factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, on our operations;

our ability to effectively manage the integration of and recognize economic benefits from businesses acquired, our operations at our current size, and any future growth; 

the conduct of our operations through joint ventures and other investments with third parties; 

immigration restrictions and related factors; 

failure to protect our IT Systems and Confidential Information against breakdowns, security breaches, and other cybersecurity risks;

litigation and other proceedings to the extent uninsured or underinsured; 

our ability to comply with the U.S. and foreign governmental regulations to which we are subject;

 our substantial indebtedness; 

risks related to tax matters; 

risks related to our Class A common stock; 

risks related to the TKO Transactions; 

risks related to our paying quarterly cash dividends, including pursuant to the Merger Agreement; 

risks related to the TKO Asset Acquisition or other dispositions we may contemplate; and 

other important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those described in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year December 31, 2023 ("2023 Annual Report") and Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 20, 2024, as updated by Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report, and Part I, Item 2. "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Quarterly Report, and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 

These risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. Even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference herein completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

 NOTES TO CONSO LIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (unaudited) 
 of the outstanding shares of the Company's stock that it does not already own (other than certain equity interests held by certain current directors and executive officers of the Company and any other Rollover Holders (the Rollover Interests )). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions and on the terms set forth therein, equityholders of EGH, EOC and Endeavor Manager are to receive in cash per share or unit, as applicable. The Merger Agreement also requires the Company to, in each calendar quarter prior to the closing, declare and pay a dividend in respect of each issued and outstanding share of the Company s Class A common stock at a price equal to per share. Completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Merger-Related Transactions") is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals. The Merger Agreement also includes certain covenants of the Company Entities, including with respect to sales of certain specified assets of the Company (other than with respect to TKO Group Holdings, Inc. ("TKO") and the agency representation business of WME), the declaration and payment of quarterly dividends, and non-solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals, as well as other customary representations, warranties and covenants by Company Entities, the Parent Entities and the Merger Subs. Completion of the Merger-Related Transactions is not subject to a financing condition, and the Merger-Related Transactions are to be financed through a combination of new and reinvested equity from affiliates of Silver Lake and additional capital by other third-party investors; the Rollover Interests; and new debt financing. The Merger-Related Transactions are expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Upon completion, the Company's common stock will no longer be listed on any public market. In September 2023, the Company completed the transactions involving the business combination of World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. ("WWE"), which is a media and entertainment company, and TKO Operating Company ("TKO OpCo"), which owns and operates the Ultimate Fighting Championship ("UFC") (the "TKO Transactions"). As part of the TKO Transactions, among other things, a new, publicly listed company, TKO, was formed. Upon closing of the TKO Transactions, Endeavor holds a controlling interest in TKO, which became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Going Concern These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to refinance or repay its long-term debt, and the attainment of profitable operations. Historically, the Company has relied principally on liquidity generated from operating activities to fund the Company s day-to-day operations and routine capital expenditures, invest in revenue-generating activities, and service its long-term debt. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate of billion outstanding indebtedness, of which billion is a term loan scheduled to mature on . We expect that the term loan then outstanding will be repaid as part of the Merger-Related Transactions or will otherwise be refinanced prior to its maturity. Absent the Company s ability to secure additional liquidity, extend the maturity of or refinance such term loan, the Company s operations may be adversely impacted in the event the lenders declare an event of default and exercise their rights and remedies under the first lien credit agreement. As a result of the upcoming maturity of the term loan on May 18, 2025, the Company has evaluated plans over the next twelve months beyond the date the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are issued to secure additional liquidity which include, but are not limited to, (i) repayment or refinancing of the term loan as part of the Merger-Related Transactions (ii) reducing discretionary capital and operating expenses (iii) obtaining additional facilities from banks and renewal of existing bank borrowings and (iv) proceeds from asset sales. While the Company has had a history of being able to secure additional liquidity or refinance its outstanding indebtedness, the feasibility of some of these plans is contingent upon factors outside of the control of the Company, and as such, these uncertainties raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company borrowed million under the Margin Loan Agreement and this amount was outstanding as of September 30, 2024. On Location Revolver The financial debt covenant of the On Location ("OL") revolving credit facility did not apply as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as OL had borrowings outstanding under the OL revolving credit agreement.

Zuffa Secured Commercial Loans As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Zuffa was in compliance with its financial debt covenant under the Zuffa Secured Commercial Loans. 2014 Credit Facilities and Zuffa Credit Facilities The 2014 Credit Facilities and the Zuffa Credit Facilities restrict the ability of certain subsidiaries of the Company to make distributions and other payments to the Company. These restrictions do include exceptions for, among other things, (1) amounts necessary to make tax payments, (2) a limited annual amount for employee equity repurchases, (3) distributions required to fund certain parent entities, (4) other specific allowable situations and (5) a general restricted payment basket.

The estimated fair values of the Company s First Lien Term Loan under the 2014 Credit Facilities and Zuffa s First Lien Term Loan under its Credit Facilities are based on quoted market values for the debt. Since the First Lien Term Loan under the 2014 Credit Facilities and Zuffa s First Lien Term Loan under its Credit Facilities do not trade on a daily basis in an active market, fair value estimates are based on market observable inputs based on quoted market prices and borrowing rates currently available for debt with similar terms and average maturities, which are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased million shares of its Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of million under this share repurchase agreement.

million and million, respectively, based on pretax loss of million and million, respectively. The continuing operations effective tax rate is and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tax expense from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the effects of reporting discontinued operations, effects related to the Company's mix of earnings, and foreign withholding taxes not based on income, resulting in a negative AETR. For the same period in 2023, the tax expense from continuing operations is primarily due to a dividend received from a subsidiary, the effects related to the Company's mix of earnings, and the acquisition of WWE in 2023. The (benefit from) provision for income taxes from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is million and million, respectively, based on pretax (loss) income of million and million, respectively. The continuing operations effective tax rate is and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tax benefit from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the Zuffa legal settlement of million that resulted in a million discrete benefit, the effects of reporting discontinued operations, effects related to the Company's mix of earnings, and foreign withholding taxes not based on income, resulting in a negative AETR. For the same period in 2023, the tax expense from continuing operations is primarily driven by the gain on sale of the Academy. Any tax balances reflected on the September 30, 2024 balance sheet will be adjusted accordingly to reflect the actual financial results for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Company s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes, withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions that are not based on net income, and income subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions which differ from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of million and million, respectively, for which it is unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities. The Company records valuation allowances against its net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing the likelihood that its

Table of Contents million and million, respectively, based on pretax (loss) income from discontinued operations of million and million, respectively. The discontinued operations effective tax rate is and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for income taxes from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is million and million, respectively, based on pretax (loss) income from discontinued operations of million and million, respectively. The effective tax rate is and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The (benefit from) provision for income taxes from discontinued operations reflects the application of the "with and without" approach to allocating income taxes between continuing and discontinued operations consistent with the general intraperiod tax allocation requirements. Other Matters On August 16, 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IRA"). The IRA, in addition to other provisions, creates a corporate alternative minimum tax ("CAMT") on adjusted financial statement income for applicable corporations. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company is not subject to CAMT and will continue to assess the potential tax effects of the CAMT on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In December 2022, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") proposed Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules, which provides for changes to numerous long-standing tax principles including the adoption of a global minimum tax rate of for multinational enterprises ("GloBE rules"). Various jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of enacting legislation to adopt GloBE rules and other countries are expected to adopt GloBE rules in the future. While changes in tax laws in the various countries in which the Company operates can negatively impact the Company's results of operations and financial position in future periods, the Company's impact related to the adoption of GloBE rules, effective January 1, 2024, was not material to the Company's consolidated financial position. The Company will continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this area. Tax Receivable Agreement In connection with the IPO and related transactions, the Company entered into a TRA with certain persons that held direct or indirect interests in EOC and Zuffa prior to the IPO ("TRA Holders"). The TRA generally provides for the payment by EGH of of the amount of any tax benefits that EGH actually realizes (determined by using certain assumptions), or in some cases is deemed to realize, as a result of the following attributes: (i) increases in EGH s share of the tax basis in the net assets of EOC resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units, (ii) increases in tax basis attributable to payments made under the TRA, (iii) deductions attributable to imputed interest pursuant to the TRA and (iv) other tax attributes (including existing tax basis) allocated to EGH post-IPO and related transactions that were allocable to the TRA Holders prior to the IPO and related transactions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a TRA liability of approximately million, after concluding that such TRA payments would be probable based on estimates of future taxable income over the term of the TRA.

 million in the aggregate relating to the three football clubs and EUR million relating to Lega Nazionale, along with attorneys fees and costs. Since December 2020, four additional football clubs have each filed requests to intervene in the Lega Nazionale proceedings and individually seek to claim damages deriving from the lower value of the media rights in the aggregate totaling EUR million. The Original Plaintiffs and these additional clubs are also seeking additional damages relating to alleged lost profits and additional charges, quantified in the fourth quarter of 2022 in amounts totaling EUR million. other clubs also filed requests to intervene in support of Lega Nazionale s claim or alternatively to individually claim damages deriving from the lower value of the media rights in the amount of EUR million, in the case of five clubs, and unspecified amounts (to be quantified as a percentage of the total amount sought by Lega Nazionale) in the other five cases. Collectively, the interventions of these 14 clubs are the "Interventions." By judgment issued on May 8, 2024, the Court of Milan ruled that the clubs have a concurrent right to bring a claim, and Lega Nazionale is entitled to retain an award of only of the aggregate loss suffered (if any) by the clubs deriving from the lower value of the media rights. The Company reserved the right to appeal the partial ruling. In December 2022, further football club filed a separate claim against IMG and certain other unrelated parties seeking damages from all defendants deriving from the lower value of the media rights in the amounts of EUR million, in addition to alleged additional damages relating to lost profits and additional charges which the club, with defensive brief on May 13, 2024, quantified in amounts totaling EUR million. The Company has defended in its submissions to date, and intends to continue to defend, against all of the damages claims, Interventions and any related claims, and management believes that the Company has meritorious defenses to these claims, including the absence of actual damage. The Company may also be subject to regulatory and other claims and actions with respect to these ICA and other regulatory matters. Any judgment entered against the Company or settlement entered into, including with respect to claims or actions brought by other parties, could materially and adversely impact the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. On April 12, 2024, purported stockholder Handelsbanken Fonder AB Handelsbanken filed a verified class action complaint on behalf of itself and similarly situated Endeavor stockholders in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Handelsbanken Fonder AB v. Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 2024-0391 ("Handelsbanken Action"), and filed a Motion for Expedited Proceedings ("Motion"). The Handelsbanken Action names as defendants the Company and certain of its affiliates, members of the Company s board of directors, Mark Shapiro, Silver Lake and certain of its affiliates, Wildcat EGH Holdco, L.P., Wildcat Opco Holdco, L.P., The Ariel Z. Emanuel Living Trust, dated November 13, 2017, and The Patrick Whitesell Revocable Trust, dated May 31, 2019, and alleges breach of charter, tortious interference, breach of fiduciary duty, and aiding and abetting claims arising from the Company s proposed transaction with Silver Lake. The Court held a hearing on Handelsbanken's Motion on May 6, 2024, during which the Court determined that a ruling on the Motion, if any, should come after the deadline for certain officers and directors to make stock rollover elections, which deadline is ninety days after the date of each of the rollover agreements, dated April 2, 2024. Following the stock rollover elections and limited discovery, on October 28, 2024, counsel for Handelsbanken withdrew the Motion. The Company additionally received multiple requests from purported stockholders seeking certain books and records in connection with the Company s proposed transaction with Silver Lake under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. related class-action lawsuits were filed against Zuffa between December 2014 and March 2015 by a total of former UFC fighters. The lawsuits, which were substantially identical, were transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Nevada and consolidated into a single action in June 2015, captioned Le et al. v. Zuffa, LLC, No. 2:15-cv-1045-RFB-BNW (D. Nev.) (the "Le" case). The lawsuit alleged that Zuffa violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by monopsonizing an alleged market for the services of elite professional MMA athletes. The fighter plaintiffs claimed that Zuffa s alleged conduct injured them by artificially depressing the compensation they received for their services, and they sought treble damages under the antitrust laws, as well as attorneys fees and costs, and, in some instances, injunctive relief. On August 9, 2023, the district court certified the lawsuit as a damages class action, encompassing the period from December 16, 2010 to June 30, 2017. The fighter plaintiffs in the Le case abandoned their claim for injunctive relief, so the only relief the fighter plaintiffs would have sought at trial was damages. On June 24, 2021, another lawsuit, Johnson et al. v. Zuffa, LLC et al., No. 2:21-cv-1189-RFB-BNW (D. Nev.) (the "Johnson" case), was filed by a putative class of former UFC fighters and covering the period from July 1, 2017 to the present and alleged substantially similar claims to the Le case and sought injunctive relief. On March 13, 2024, TKO OpCo, and certain of its affiliates, including Endeavor, reached an agreement to settle all claims asserted in both class action lawsuits (Le and Johnson) for an aggregate amount of million payable by TKO and its subsidiaries, which was submitted to the court for preliminary approval. On July 30, 2024, following the court's hearings on plaintiff's submission to approve the settlement, the court issued an order denying the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. On September 26, 2024, following the court's denial of an earlier proposed settlement agreement, TKO OpCo reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted in the Le case for an aggregate amount of million payable in installments over an agreed-upon period of time (the "Updated Settlement Agreement"). The terms of the Updated Settlement Agreement have been memorialized in a long form agreement, which was preliminarily approved by the court on October 22, 2024. In connection with the proposed settlement agreements, the Company recorded charges of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company paid million of the aggregate million settlement amount into escrow in late October 2024 shortly following receipt of preliminary approval in accordance with the terms of the Updated Settlement Agreement. The Company expects to make two payments covering the remaining million in 2025. The Company anticipates that the settlement amount will be deductible for tax purposes. A motion to dismiss Endeavor from the Johnson action remains pending and no trial date has been set.

McMahon, who served as the Executive Chairman of TKO's Board of Directors until January 26, 2024, previously controlled a significant portion of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of TKO s common stock. Mr. McMahon has agreed to make future payments to certain counterparties personally. In accordance with the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5T, Miscellaneous Accounting, Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholders Topic 5T ), TKO concluded that these amounts should be recognized by TKO as expenses in the period in which they become probable and estimable. As of December 31, 2023 , total liabilities of million are included within accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet relat e d to future payments owed by Mr. McMahon to certain counterparties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Mr. McMahon made payments of million associated with these liabilities to certain counterparties directly. Since these liabilities existed when Mr. McMahon controlled a significant portion of the voting power of TKO s common stock, these payments are considered non-cash capital contributions and are included as principal stockholder contributions in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity. 

billion, based on the volume-weighted average sales price of TKO Class A common stock for the twenty-five trading days ending on October 23, 2024 (the "TKO Asset Acquisition"). Upon completion of the TKO Asset Acquisition, the Company will receive approximately million common units of TKO OpCo and will subscribe for an equal number of shares of TKO Class B common stock, at which point the Company expects to own approximately of TKO, with the other existing TKO shareholders owning the remaining . The TKO Asset Acquisition is also subject to purchase price adjustments to be settled in cash and equity. The TKO Asset Acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of TKO common stock in favor of adopting the transaction agreement (which has been satisfied by delivery of a written consent by such stockholders). The TKO Asset Acquisition will be accounted for as a common control transaction between the companies. In October 2024, the Company commenced a review and potential sale of certain assets within its events portfolio, including but not limited to the Miami Open and the Madrid Open tennis tournaments and art platform, Frieze. The Company has not set a deadline or definitive timetable for the completion of this review process, and there can be no assurance that the review will result in any specific action. In October 2024, TKO announced that its board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to billion of its Class A common stock and the approval of a quarterly cash dividend program pursuant to which holders of TKO Class A common stock will receive their pro rata share of million expected quarterly distributions to be made by TKO OpCo. TKO will determine at its discretion the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, and other factors. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and TKO is not obligated to acquire any particular amount under the share repurchase program. The share repurchase program has no expiration, is expected to be completed within approximately three to four years and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. TKO's dividend will be paid quarterly to holders of TKO Class A common stock. TKO intends to begin making quarterly cash dividend payments on March 31, 2025. Future declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to the determination and discretion of TKO based on its consideration of various factors, such as its results of operations, financial condition, market conditions, earnings, cash flow requirements, restrictions in its debt agreements and legal requirements and other factors that TKO deems relevant.

 Item 2. Ma nagement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and with our audited financial statements and related notes included in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 20, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report or in other sections of the 2023 Annual Report, our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 20, 2024, and this Quarterly Report. 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 Endeavor is a global sports and entertainment company. We own and operate premium sports and entertainment properties, including the UFC and WWE through our majority ownership of TKO, produce and distribute sports and entertainment content, own and manage exclusive live events and experiences, and represent top sports, entertainment and fashion talent, as well as blue chip corporate clients. Founded as a client representation business, we expanded organically and through strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in new capabilities, including sports operations and advisory, events and experiences management, media production and distribution, brand licensing, and experiential marketing. The addition of these new capabilities and insights transformed our business into an integrated global platform anchored by owned and managed premium intellectual property. 
 Agreement and Plan of Merger 
 In April 2024, following our review to evaluate strategic alternatives, we entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which affiliates of Silver Lake agreed to acquire 100 of the outstanding shares of our stock that it does not already own (other than certain equity interests held by certain current directors and executive officers of the Company and any other Rollover Holders (the Rollover Interests )). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions and on the terms set forth therein, equityholders of Endeavor, Endeavor Operating Company and Endeavor Manager are to receive 27.50 in cash per share or unit, as applicable. The Merger Agreement also requires the Company to, in each calendar quarter prior to the closing, declare and pay a dividend in respect of each issued and outstanding share of the Company s Class A common stock at a price equal to 0.06 per share. Completion of the Merger-Related Transactions is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals. 
 The Merger Agreement also includes certain covenants of the Company Entities, including with respect to sales of certain specified assets of the Company (see below) (other than with respect to TKO and the agency representation business of WME), the declaration and payment of quarterly dividends, and non-solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals, as well as other customary representations, warranties and covenants by Company Entities, the Parent Entities and the Merger Subs. 
 Completion of the Merger-Related Transactions is not subject to a financing condition, and the Merger-Related Transactions are to be financed through a combination of new and reinvested equity from Silver Lake and additional capital by other third-party investors; the Rollover Interests; and new debt financing. The Merger-Related Transactions are expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Upon completion, our common stock will no longer be listed on any public market. For a discussion of risks relating to the Merger-Related Transactions, see Part II, Item 1A., Risk Factors. 
 Asset dispositions 
 In October 2024, we entered into an agreement with TKO and TKO OpCo, pursuant to which TKO OpCo will acquire Professional Bull Riders ("PBR"), On Location, and certain of the IMG businesses for total consideration of 3.25 billion, based on the volume-weighted average sales price of TKO Class A common stock for the twenty-five trading days ending on October 23, 2024 (the "TKO Asset Acquisition"). Upon completion of the TKO Asset Acquisition, we will receive approximately 26.1 million common units of TKO OpCo and will subscribe for an equal number of shares of TKO Class B common stock, at which point we expect to own approximately 59 of TKO, with the other existing TKO shareholders owning the remaining 41 . The TKO Asset Acquisition is also subject to purchase price adjustments to be settled in cash and equity. The TKO Asset Acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of TKO common stock in favor of adopting the transaction agreement (which has been satisfied by delivery of a written consent by such stockholders). The TKO Asset Acquisition will be accounted for as a common control transaction between the companies. 
 In October 2024, we commenced a review and potential sale of certain assets within our events portfolio, including but not limited to the Miami Open and the Madrid Open tennis tournaments and art platform, Frieze. We have not set a deadline or definitive timetable for the completion of this review process, and there can be no assurance that the review will result in any specific action. 
 Segments 
 As a result of our Sports Data Technology ("SD T") segment being presented as discontinued operations (see Note 4, "Discontinued Operations" to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further detail), we operate our business in three reportable segments in our continuing operations as of September 30, 2024: (i) Owned Sports Properties; (ii) Events, Experiences Rights; and (iii) Representation. 
 Owned Sports Properties 
 Our Owned Sports Properties segment is comprised of a unique portfolio of premium sports and entertainment properties, including UFC, WWE, PBR and Euroleague. 
 Through the UFC, the world s premier professional MMA organization, we produce more than 40 live events annually which are broadcast in over 170 countries and territories to over 975 million TV households. UFC is among the most popular sports organizations in the world with more 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 than 700 million fans and approximately 260 million social media followers. UFC's content reaches a global audience through an increasing array of global broadcast license agreements and our owned FIGHT PASS streaming platform. The value of our content is demonstrated by our licensing arrangements with ESPN and other international broadcasters and our increasing consumer engagement is evidenced by the overall follower growth and engagement across our social channels. 
 In September 2023, we completed the transactions involving the business combination of World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. ("WWE") and TKO Operating Company ("TKO OpCo"), which owns and operates UFC (the "TKO Transactions"). As part of the TKO Transactions, among other things, a new, publicly listed company, TKO Group Holdings, Inc. ("TKO"), was formed. As a result of the TKO Transactions and at the time of closing, (A) EGH and/or its subsidiaries received (1) a 51.0 controlling non-economic voting interest in TKO on a fully-diluted basis and (2) a 51.0 economic interest on a fully-diluted basis in the operating subsidiary, TKO OpCo, which owns all of the assets of the UFC and WWE businesses after the closing of the TKO Transactions, and (B) the stockholders of WWE received (1) a 49.0 voting interest in TKO on a fully-diluted basis and (2) a 100.0 economic interest in TKO, which in turn holds a 49.0 economic interest in TKO OpCo on a fully-diluted basis. 
 WWE, an integrated media and entertainment organization and the recognized global leader in sports entertainment, produces and distributes unique and creative content through various channels, including content rights agreements for its flagship programs, Raw, SmackDown and NXT , premium live event programming, monetization across social media outlets, live events, and licensing of various WWE themed consumer products. WWE has over 700 million fans and approximately 360 million brand social media followers and 610 million social media followers of talent accounts managed by WWE. WWE counts nearly 100 million YouTube subscribers, making it one of the most viewed YouTube channels globally, and its year-round programming is available in over one billion households across over 150 countries. 
 PBR is the world s premier bull riding circuit with more than 800 bull riders from the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico, currently competing in more than 200 bull riding events annually and with its annual attendance quadrupling since its inception in 1995. 
 We have an up to 20-year partnership with Euroleague basketball, which could extend into 2036, to manage and capitalize on all of the commercial business of the league, including media rights, sponsorship, content production, licensing, digital distribution, events staging, and hospitality, for which we receive a management fee. 
 
 Events, Experiences Rights 
 In our Events, Experiences Rights segment, we own, operate, or represent hundreds of global events annually, including live sports events covering 15 sports globally, international fashion weeks, art fairs and music, culinary and lifestyle festivals and major attractions. We own and operate many of these events, including the Miami Open and Madrid Open, Frieze art fairs, The Armory Show, EXPO Chicago, Barrett-Jackson, Australian Fashion Week, and Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. We also operate other events on behalf of third parties, including the Chevron Championship and AIG Women s Open. Through On Location, we provide premium live event experiences globally, servicing more than 1,200 events and experiences for sporting and music events such as the Super Bowl, FIFA World Cup 2026, the Aer Lingus Classic college football game, the Ryder Cup, the NCAA Final Four, Coachella and the 2024, 2026 and 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. 
 We are one of the largest independent global distributors of sports programming. We sell media rights globally on behalf of more than 150 rights holders such as the International Olympic Committee, the National Football League, the ATP and WTA Tours, and the National Hockey League, as well as for our owned assets and channels. Our production business is one of the largest creators of sports programming, responsible for thousands of hours of content on behalf of more than 200 federations, associations and events, including the English Premier League, Major League Soccer, The R A, DP World Tour, Saudi Pro League, and our owned assets, like UFC and WWE, as well as owned channel Sport 24. 
 Additionally, we previously owned and operated IMG Academy, a leading sports and education brand with an innovative suite of on-campus and online programming, including its Bradenton, Florida boarding school and sports camps, IMG Academy+ online coaching, as well as Next College Student Athlete, which provided recruiting and admissions services to high school student athletes and college athletic departments and admissions officers (collectively, the "Academy"). In June 2023, we sold all of the Academy business. 
 
 Representation 
 Our Representation segment provides services to more than 7,000 talent and corporate clients. Our Representation business deploys a subset of our integrated capabilities on behalf of our clients. 
 Through our client representation businesses, including the WME talent agency and IMG Models, we represent a diverse group of talent across entertainment, sports, and fashion, including actors, directors, writers, athletes, models, musicians, and other artists, in a variety of mediums, such as film, television, books, and live events. Through our 160over90 business, we provide brand strategy, marketing, advertising, public relations, analytics, digital, activation, and experiential services to many of the world s largest brands. Through IMG's licensing business, we provide intellectual property licensing services to a large portfolio of entertainment, sports, and consumer product brands, including representing these clients in the licensing of their logos, trade names and trademarks. Additionally, we own and operate unscripted content companies, including Asylum Entertainment Group, Film 45, and Glassman. 
 
 Sports Data Technology 
 The SD T segment includes OpenBet, which specializes in betting engine products, services and technology, processing billions of bets annually, as well as trading, pricing and risk management tools; player account and wallet solutions; innovative front-end user experiences and user interfaces; and content offerings, such as BetBuilder, DonBest pricing feeds and a sports content aggregation platform. As part of OpenBet, IMG ARENA delivers live streaming and data feeds for more than 65,000 sports events annually to sportsbooks, rightsholders and media partners around the globe. This data also powers IMG ARENA's portfolio of on-demand virtual sports products and front-end solutions, including the UFC Event Centre. As contemplated in the Merger Agreement with Silver Lake, which was executed in April 2024, we initiated a process to sell certain of our businesses. During the second quarter of 2024, we began to actively market the businesses comprising our SD T segment. As a result, the assets and 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 liabilities are considered held for sale, and we determined the SD T segment continued to meet the definition of a discontinued operation in the quarter ended September 30, 2024; and, as such, we have recast our financial statements to present the SD T segment as discontinued operations. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 In our Owned Sports Properties segment, we primarily generate revenue via media rights fees, pay-per-view, sponsorships, ticket sales, subscriptions, and license fees. In our Events, Experiences Rights segment, we primarily generate revenue from media rights sales, production service and studio fees, sponsorships, ticket and premium experience sales, subscriptions, streaming fees, profit sharing, commissions and tuition prior to the sale of the Academy. In our Representation segment, we generate revenue primarily through commissions, packaging fees, marketing and consulting fees, production fees, and content licensing fees. In our SD T segment, which is presented as discontinued operations, we primarily generate revenue via media and data rights fees, software license fees, and service fees, by providing media, data and technology platforms that offer tailored solutions for sportsbooks as well as trading and pricing solutions. 
 Direct Operating Costs 
 Our direct operating costs primarily include third-party expenses associated with the production of events and experiences, content production costs, fees for media rights, including required payments related to media sales agency contracts when minimum sales guarantees are not met, venue rental and related costs associated with the staging of our live events, compensation costs for our athletes and talent, and material and related costs associated with our consumer product merchandise sales. Prior to the sale of the Academy, our direct operating costs included the operation of our training and education facilities. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs as well as rent, professional service costs and other overhead required to support our operations and corporate structure. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 EGH was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 2019. It was formed as a holding company for the purpose of completing an IPO and other related transactions. As the sole managing member of Endeavor Manager, which is the sole managing member of EOC, EGH operates and controls all the business and affairs of EOC, and through EOC and its subsidiaries, conducts the Company s business. EGH is subject to corporate income tax on its share of taxable income or loss of EOC, derived from Endeavor Manager. EOC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is therefore not subject to U.S. corporate income tax. However, certain of EOC s subsidiaries are subject to U.S. or foreign corporate income tax. In addition, TKO, which is a consolidated subsidiary of EGH, is subject to corporate income tax. 
 Organization 
 Prior to the closing of the IPO on May 3, 2021, we undertook reorganization transactions, following which Endeavor Group Holdings became a holding company, and its principal asset is an equity interest in a newly formed subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings, Endeavor Manager, of which Endeavor Group Holdings serves as the managing member. Endeavor Manager is in turn the managing member of Endeavor Operating Company. Endeavor Group Holdings manages and operates the business and controls the strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of Endeavor Manager as its sole managing member, and Endeavor Operating Company as its indirect sole managing member, and also has a substantial financial interest in Endeavor Manager and, indirectly, Endeavor Operating Company. Accordingly, Endeavor Group Holdings consolidates the results of operations of Endeavor Manager and Endeavor Operating Company, and a portion of Endeavor Group Holding s net income (loss) is allocated to non-controlling interests to reflect the entitlements of certain former members of Endeavor Operating Company who retain ownership interests in Endeavor Manager and Endeavor Operating Company. 
 After consummation of the IPO and the reorganization transactions, we became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to taxable income of Endeavor Operating Company that is allocable to Endeavor Manager, and we are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. Endeavor Operating Company generally makes distributions to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our tax obligations and operating expenses, including distributions to fund any ordinary course payments due under the tax receivable agreement ("TRA"). The Company entered into the TRA with certain persons that held direct or indirect interests in EOC and UFC Parent prior to the IPO. The TRA generally provides for the payment by EGH of 85 of the amount of any tax benefits that EGH actually realizes (determined by using certain assumptions) or in some cases is deemed to realize as further described below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Future sources and uses of liquidity Tax receivable agreement."

Revenue 
 Revenue increased 812.2 million, or 66.6 , to 2,031.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Owned Sports Properties increased by 255.5 million, or 53.2 . WWE, which was acquired in September 2023, contributed 275 million to the increase. At PBR, the increase was driven by a new media deal as well as increases in ticket sales and team related revenue from the addition of two teams. This increase was partially offset by decreases at the UFC driven by lower media rights and live event revenue from holding one fewer numbered event and two fewer fight night events compared to the prior period, partially offset by increased sponsorships. 

Events, Experiences Rights increased by 532.7 million, or 145.1 . The increase was primarily driven by higher events and performance revenue due to the Paris Olympics and an increase in media rights and production. 

Representation increased by 43.6 million, or 11.3 . The increase was primarily driven by growth in our agency business in talent and music, partially offset by a decrease in our non-scripted business. 

Revenue increased 1,521.5 million, or 37.8 , to 5,542.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Owned Sports Properties increased by 1,141.6 million, or 97.3 . WWE, which was acquired in September 2023, contributed 1,048 million to the increase. At the UFC, the increase was driven by an increase in live event revenue, higher site fees, and sponsorships, partially offset by a net decrease in media rights fees from holding fewer events compared to the prior period and increases in contractual revenues. Additionally, at PBR, the increase was driven by a new media deal and an increase in team related revenue, sponsorships and ticket sales. 

Events, Experiences Rights increased by 358.0 million, or 20.4 . The increase was primarily driven by higher events and performance revenue due to increases from the Paris Olympics, Super Bowl, the Miami Open, the Madrid Open and growth from new and other existing events, partially offset by the sale of the Academy in June 2023. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in media rights revenue, primarily due to the biennial Arabian Gulf Cup held in January 2023 and set to take place in December 2024 as well as a decrease in media production revenue primarily due to lost business and timing of events. 

Representation increased by 69.0 million, or 6.2 . The increase was primarily driven by growth in our agency business in music, talent, and sports as well as an increase in our marketing business. These increases were partially offset by decreases in our non-scripted, fashion and licensing businesses.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 608 million in connection with the Paris Olympics and other event revenue increases mentioned above as well as 75 million related to WWE, which was acquired in September 2023. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in connection with the non-scripted revenue decline mentioned above.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 731 million in connection with the Paris Olympics and other event revenue increases mentioned above as well as 307 million related to WWE, which was acquired in September 2023. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in connection with the non-scripted revenue decline mentioned above and the sale of the Academy in June 2023. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 120.1 million, or 17.9 , to 791.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was principally due to the inclusion of WWE; a net increase at UFC due to the increase of 40.0 million for the settlement of the UFC class action lawsuit as well as higher cost of personnel and other operating expenses, including TKO executive compensation and other public company expenses following the TKO Transactions, partially offset by professional advisor costs, bonuses and restructuring charges, including equity-based compensation expense, incurred in 2023 related to the TKO Transactions; cost of personnel other than TKO driven by growth in other businesses and the Olympics' related investment; and professional service costs, which includes our evaluation and execution of strategic alternatives.

The increase for both periods was primarily driven by intangibles acquired through acquisitions partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.

 Tax receivable agreement liability adjustment 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded adjustments of less than (0.1) million, (20.3) million, (2.5) million and (7.8) million, respectively, for the tax receivable agreement liability. which related to a change in estimates related to future TRA payments.

The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily included 14 million for foreign currency transaction losses. 
 Other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 32.6 million of income compared to 753.5 million of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily included 14 million for foreign currency transaction gains, 7 million of gains from the sales of investments, 3 million of gains due to the change in the fair value of embedded foreign currency derivatives and 2 million of gains for the change in fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts. The income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily included net gains of 743.1 million from the sales of certain businesses, of which 737.0 million was from the sale of our Academy business, 3 million of gains for the change in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and 2 million of gains from changes in the fair value of equity investments. 
 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for income taxes from continuing operations of 113.8 million compared to a provision for income taxes from continuing operations of 20.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The tax 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 expense from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the effects of reporting discontinued operations, effects related to our mix of earnings, and foreign withholding taxes not based on income, resulting in a negative annual effective income tax rate ("AETR"). For the same period in 2023, the tax expense from continuing operations is primarily due to a dividend received from a subsidiary, the effects related to our mix of earnings and the acquisition of WWE in 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a benefit from income taxes from continuing operations of (93.1) million compared to a provision for income taxes from continuing operations of 195.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax benefit from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the Zuffa legal settlement of 375.0 million that resulted in a 77.7 million discrete benefit, the effects of reporting discontinued operations, effects related to our mix of earnings, and foreign withholding taxes not based on income, resulting in a negative AETR. For the same period in 2023, the tax expense from continuing operations is primarily driven by the gain on sale of the Academy. 
 Equity losses of affiliates, net of tax 
 Equity losses of affiliates increased 2.5 million to 5.2 million and decreased 12.0 million to 10.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The losses primarily related to our investment in Fifth Season. 
 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax 
 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 234.1 million of loss compared to 1.0 million of income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 686.9 million of loss compared to 1.5 million of loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to the write-down of the SD T segment's carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell of 420.1 million, partially offset by the benefit for income taxes of (208.2) million. The loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to the write-down of the SD T segment's carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell of 434.1 million and the goodwill impairment charges of 205.9 million, partially offset by the benefit for income taxes of (24.0) million. Subsequent changes to the carrying value or the estimated fair value less costs to sell may result in additional losses in the future. 
 Net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests 
 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was 155.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of 46.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by the significant loss from discontinued operations recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was (361.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income to non-controlling interests of 244.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to the change in the amount of reported net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven primarily by the loss from discontinued operations, versus the reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which included the gain on the sale of the Academy.

 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 We classify our business into three reporting segments: Owned Sports Properties; Events, Experiences Rights; and Representation. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our segments based on segment Revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes segment Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability and is used to evaluate the operating performance of our segments and for planning and forecasting purposes, including the allocation of resources and capital. 
 Segment operating results reflect earnings before corporate and unallocated shared expenses. Segment operating results include allocations of certain costs, including facilities, technology, and other shared services costs, which are allocated based on metrics designed to correlate with consumption. These allocations are agreed-upon amounts between the businesses and may differ from amounts that would be negotiated in arm s length transactions. 
 The following tables display Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for each of our segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income (loss), excluding the results of discontinued operations, income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, merger, acquisition and earn-out costs, certain legal costs and settlements, restructuring, severance and impairment charges, certain non-cash fair value adjustments, certain equity earnings (losses), net

 gains on sales of businesses, TRA liability adjustment, and certain other items, when applicable. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue. 
 Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from our capital investments and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and improves comparability by eliminating the significant level of interest expense associated with our debt facilities, as well as income taxes and the TRA, which may not be comparable with other companies based on our tax and corporate structure. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used as the primary bases to evaluate our consolidated operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and 

they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows. 

We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin along with other comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered substitutes for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of our financial performance, as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. Although we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because it does not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as indications that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. These non-GAAP financial measures, as determined and presented by us, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations of our most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to these non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis.

The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to awards granted at the IPO under the Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc.'s 2021 Incentive Award Plan becoming fully vested partially offset by awards granted under the new TKO equity plan and the WWE plan assumed in connection with the TKO Transactions. Equity-based compensation was recognized in all segments and Corporate for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Historical liquidity and capital resources 
 Sources and uses of cash 
 Cash flows from operations have historically funded our day-to-day operations, revenue-generating activities, and routine capital expenditures, as well as serviced our long-term debt. Our other principal use of cash has been the acquisition of businesses, which have been funded primarily through equity contributions from our pre-IPO institutional investors, the issuance of long-term debt and proceeds from our IPO and other sales of our equity. 
 Debt Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 5.0 billion outstanding indebtedness under our first lien credit agreement entered into by certain of our subsidiaries in May 2014 in connection with the acquisition of IMG (as amended, restated, modified and/or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Facilities") and UFC Holdings, LLC s term loan and revolving credit facilities (the "UFC Credit Facilities" and, collectively with the Credit Facilities, the "Senior Credit Facilities"). As of September 30, 2024, we had total borrowing capacity of 455 million under the Senior Credit Facilities, of which approximately 352 million was available to borrow. 
 Credit Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowed an aggregate of 2.2 billion of a term loan under the Credit Facilities. The loan bears interest at a variable interest rate equal to either, at our option, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a credit spread adjustment (as defined in the credit agreement), or the Alternate Base Rate (the "ABR") plus an applicable margin. SOFR term loans accrue interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus 2.75 , with a SOFR floor of 0.00 . ABR term loans accrue interest at a rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5 , (b) the prime rate, (c) SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00 and (d) 1.00 , plus (ii) 1.75 . The term loan under the Credit Facilities includes 1 principal amortization payable in equal quarterly installments and mature on May 18, 2025. 
 In May 2019, we executed 1.5 billion in interest rate hedges to swap a portion of our debt from floating interest expense to fixed. Originally, the LIBOR portion of the facility had been fixed at a coupon of 2.12 for five years commencing from June 2019 until June 2024. In June 2023, we executed amendments to transition the interest rate swaps from LIBOR to SOFR with a new average fixed coupon of approximately 2.05 effective July 31, 2023. These interest rate hedges matured during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. In August 2022, we entered into 750 million of an additional interest rate hedge to swap a portion of our debt from floating interest expense to fixed. Originally, the LIBOR portion of the facility had been fixed at a coupon of 3.162 commencing from August 2022 until August 2024. In June 2023, we executed an amendment to transition the interest rate swap from LIBOR to SOFR with a new fixed coupon of approximately 3.10 effective July 31, 2023. Beginning in the third quarter 2024, we will no longer have fixed rate interest on any portion of our term loan outstanding under the Credit Facilities; as such, our interest expense will increase in future quarters. See Note 11, "Debt" to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further detail on the Credit Facilities. 
 The Credit Facilities also include a revolving credit facility which has 250.0 million of capacity with letter of credit and swingline loan sub-limits of up 20.0 million. Revolving credit facility borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate equal to either, at our option, SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment, or the ABR plus an applicable margin. SOFR revolving loans accrue interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus 2.00-2.50 , depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio, with a SOFR floor of 0.00 . ABR revolving loans accrue interest at a rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50 , (b) the prime rate, (c) SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00 and (d) 1.00 , plus (ii) 1.00-1.50 , depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio. We pay Letter of Credit fees of 0.125 and a commitment fee of 0.25-0.50 , based on our First Lien Leverage Ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we had 75.0 million outstanding under this revolving credit facility and outstanding letters of credit of 28.5 million. In May 2024, we entered into an amendment to extend the maturity date of this revolving credit facility from November 18, 2024 to April 2, 2025 and increased the borrowing capacity from 200.0 million to 250.0 million. 
 The revolving facility under the Credit Facilities is subject to a financial covenant if greater than 35 of the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility is utilized (excluding cash collateralized letters of credit and non-cash collateralized letters of credit of up to 50.0 million) at the end of each quarter. This covenant was not applicable as of September 30, 2024, as we did not utilize greater than thirty-five percent of the borrowing capacity. 
 The Credit Facilities contain certain restrictive covenants around indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, guarantees, investments, asset sales, and transactions with affiliates. 
 The borrower s obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain of our indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. All obligations under the Credit Facilities and the related guarantees are secured by a perfected first priority lien on substantially all of the borrower s and the guarantors tangible and intangible assets, in each case, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions. 
 UFC Credit Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowed an aggregate of 2.7 billion of a first lien term loan under the UFC Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the UFC Credit Facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate equal to either, at our option, SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment (as defined in the UFC credit agreement), or the ABR plus an applicable margin. SOFR term loans accrue interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus 2.75 -3.00 , depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio, in each case with a SOFR floor of 0.75 . ABR term loans accrue interest at a rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5 , (b) the prime rate, (c) SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00 and (d) 1.75 , plus (ii) 1.75 -2.00 . The term loan under the UFC Credit Facilities includes 1.00 principal amortization payable in equal quarterly installments and

 mature on April 29, 2026. See Note 11, "Debt" to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further detail on the UFC Credit Facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have the option to borrow incremental loans in an aggregate amount equal to at least 455.0 million, subject to market demand, and may be able to borrow additional funds depending on our First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined under the UFC Credit Facilities). The credit agreement governing the UFC Credit Facilities includes certain mandatory prepayment provisions relating to, among other things, the incurrence of additional debt. 
 The UFC Credit Facilities also include a revolving credit facility, which has 205.0 million of total borrowing capacity and letters of credit up to 40.0 million. Revolving credit facility borrowings under the UFC Credit Facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate equal to either, at our option, SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment or ABR plus an applicable margin. SOFR revolving loans accrue interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus 2.75-3.00 , depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio, in each case with a SOFR floor of 0.00 . ABR revolving loans accrue interest at a rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50 , (b) the prime rate, (c) SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00 and (d) 1.00 , plus (ii) 2.50-3.00 , depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio. We pay a commitment fee on the revolving credit facility under the UFC Credit Facilities of 0.25-0.50 , based on the First Lien Leverage Ratio and Letter of Credit fees of 0.125 . As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility and outstanding letters of credit of 10.0 million. In April 2024, TKO borrowed 150.0 million under this revolving credit facility to fund a repurchase of its Class A common stock and repaid 150.0 million in June 2024. In May 2024, we entered into an amendment to extend the maturity of this credit facility from October 29, 2024 to October 29, 2025. 
 The revolving credit facility under the UFC Credit Facilities is subject to a financial covenant if greater than 35 of the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility (excluding cash collateralized letters of credit and non-cash collateralized letters of credit of up to 10.0 million) is utilized at the end of any fiscal quarter. This covenant was not applicable as of September 30, 2024, as we had no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility. 
 The UFC Credit Facilities contain certain restrictive covenants around indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, guarantees, investments, asset sales and transactions with affiliates. 
 The borrower s obligations under the UFC Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain of UFC Parent s indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. All obligations under the UFC Credit Facilities and the related guarantees are secured by a perfected first priority lien on substantially all of the borrower s and the guarantors tangible and intangible assets, in each case, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions. 
 Restrictions on Dividends 
 Both the Credit Facilities and the UFC Credit Facilities contain restrictions on our ability to make distributions and other payments from the respective credit groups and which therefore limit our ability to receive cash from our operating units to make dividends to the holders of Class A common stock. These restrictions on dividends include exceptions for, among other things, (1) amounts necessary to make tax payments, (2) a limited annual amount for employee equity repurchases, (3) distributions required to fund certain parent entities, (4) other specific allowable situations and (5) a general restricted payment basket, as defined in each of the Credit Facilities and the UFC Credit Facilities. 
 Other Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had certain other revolving line of credit facilities and long-term debt liabilities, primarily related to On Location, with total committed amounts of 62.9 million, of which none was outstanding and 62.9 million was available for borrowing based on the supporting asset base. Such facilities have maturity dates in 2025, bearing interest at rates of 2.75 plus SOFR. 
 Our On Location revolving credit agreement has 42.9 million of total borrowing capacity and letter of credit sub-limits of up to 3.0 million (the "OL Credit Facility"). As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the OL Credit Facility and no letters of credit outstanding. The OL Credit Facility matures on the earlier of August 2026 or the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the term loan under the Credit Facilities. The OL Credit Facility contains restrictions that are substantially similar to those in the Credit Facilities and the UFC Credit Facilities. 
 The OL Credit Facility is subject to a financial covenant if greater than 40 of the borrowing capacity is utilized (excluding cash collateralized letters of credit and non-cash collateralized letters of credit of up to 2.0 million) at the end of each quarter. This covenant was not applicable as of September 30, 2024, as we had no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility. 
 In September 2024, January Capital HoldCo, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of EGH, entered into a new five-year secured credit agreement (the "Margin Loan Agreement"), which matures on September 13, 2029. Under the Margin Loan Agreement, we may borrow up to 175.0 million in a term loan. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to 2.5 billion. The interest rate on the drawn amount under the Margin Loan Agreement is the 3-month Term SOFR (as defined therein) plus 3.0 , payable quarterly. At our election, interest may be paid in cash or in kind by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Agreement. As security for the Margin Loan Agreement, we have granted a first-priority lien to the lenders, pro rata to the amount of their commitments, on 6.1 million common units of TKO OpCo and a corresponding number of shares of TKO Class B common stock (collectively, the "Pledged Securities"). If we default on our obligations under the Margin Loan Agreement, then the lenders can declare all amounts outstanding under the Margin Loan Agreement, with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable, and if we are unable to pay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the Pledged Securities and any other collateral that then secures borrowings under the Margin Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowed an aggregate of 175.0 million under the Margin Loan Agreement.

Cash from operating activities improved from 231.5 million of cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 526.2 million of cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a net loss of 290.7 million, which included non-cash items of 558.2 million, the increase in accrued liabilities of 553.4 million primarily due to the settlement of the UFC class action lawsuit, the net decrease in deferred costs and deferred revenue of 61.3 million due to the Paris Olympics, Super Bowl and other events occurring during the period, partially offset by the increase in other assets of 231.8 million due to Federation Internationale de Football Association costs and deferred media rights costs and the increase in accounts receivable of 194.0 million primarily due to timing of events and timing of collections from customers. Cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to net income of 588.3 million, which included the gain on sale of the Academy business and non-cash items of 161.8 million offset by increases in deferred costs of 190.8 million primarily due to the advanced payments made by us in the buildup to the Olympics. 
 Cash from investing activities changed from 849.1 million of cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to (163.3) million of cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected payments for capital expenditures and investments in non-controlled affiliates totaling 193.9 million partially offset by cash proceeds received from the sale of assets of 16.7 million. Cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflected net cash proceeds received from the sale of businesses of 1.077 billion, primarily driven by the sale of the Academy business, partially offset by payments for capital expenditures and investments in non-controlled affiliates totaling 242.1 million. 
 Cash from financing activities changed from (489.8) million of cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to (340.3) million of cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected payments for the debt, acquisition of non-controlling interests, dividends, the tax receivable agreement, and distributions of 343.5 million, 316.8 million, 80.6 million, 62.5 million, and 41.2 million, respectively, partially offset by borrowings of debt of 521.5 million. Cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflected the repurchase of Class A common stock, payments for debt, distributions, acquisition of non-controlling interests, the tax receivable agreement and dividends of 200.0 million, 173.8 million, 59.6 million, 43.8 million, 37.5 million, and 27.4 million, respectively, partially offset by borrowings of debt of 73.2 million. 
 Net cash flows for discontinued operations changed from 10.6 million of net cash provided by discontinued operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to (141.0) million of cash used in discontinued operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in discontinued operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a net loss of 686.9 million, which included non-cash items totaling 649.9 million, of which 434.1 million was for a write-down of the SD T segment's carrying value to its estimated fair value less cost to sell and 205.9 million was for impairment charges, changes in working capital, and payments for capital expenditures and deferred consideration related to acquisitions of 32.3 million and 13.7 million, respectively. Net cash provided by discontinued operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by a net loss of 1.5 million, which included non-cash items totaling 47.2 million and a net increase in working capital offset by payments related to the acquisition of businesses and capital expenditures of 19.9 million and 26.4 million, respectively. 
 Future sources and uses of liquidity 
 Our sources of liquidity are (1) cash on hand, (2) cash flows from operations, and (3) available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (which borrowings would be subject to certain restrictive covenants contained therein). 
 We expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (1) provide capital to facilitate organic growth of our business, (2) fund future investments, acquisitions and earn-outs and deferred purchase price payments from prior acquisitions, (3) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, (4) fund capital expenditures, (5) pay the settlement of the Zuffa class action lawsuit, (6) pay interest and principal when due on our Senior Credit Facilities, (7) pay EDR quarterly dividends as required per the Merger Agreement, (8) fund the purchases of TKO Class A common stock under the TKO share repurchase program, (9) pay TKO quarterly dividends, (10) make payments under the TRA, (11) pay income taxes, and (12) make distributions to members. 
 The term loan under the Credit Facilities of 2.2 billion matures on May 18, 2025. We expect that the amount of the term loan outstanding as of the closing of the Merger-Related Transactions will be repaid as part of the Merger-Related Transactions or that the term loan will otherwise be refinanced prior to its maturity. Absent the Company s ability to secure additional liquidity, extend the maturity of or refinance such term loan, the Company s operations may be adversely impacted in the event the lenders declare an event of default and exercise their rights and remedies under the first lien credit agreement under the Credit Facilities. In the event the Merger-Related Transactions do not close by the maturity date or if we are 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 unable to refinance or otherwise extend prior to maturity, we do not expect to have sufficient cash on hand to repay this term loan under the Credit Facilities. This uncertainty raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 For the UFC Credit Facilities, we expect to refinance the outstanding loan prior to their maturity in 2026. We currently anticipate being able to secure funding for such refinancing at favorable terms; however, our ability to do so may be impacted by many factors, including our growth and other factors specific to our business as well as macro-economic factors beyond our control. 
 Tax Distributions by Endeavor Operating Company 
 Other than as described above and below, we expect to retain all our future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. 
 Subject to funds being legally available and certain exceptions, the operating agreement of Endeavor Operating Company generally provides for distributions to each of its members, including the Endeavor Profits Units holders and Endeavor Manager, in amounts sufficient to pay applicable taxes attributable to each member s allocable share of taxable income of Endeavor Operating Company. Tax distributions made in respect of Endeavor Operating Company Units (but not Endeavor Profits Units) will generally be made pro rata in respect of such Units, as described in the Endeavor Operating Company LLC Agreement. However, in certain situations, tax distributions made to Endeavor Manager may be reduced (relative to those tax distributions made to the other members of Endeavor Operating Company) to reflect the income tax rates to which Endeavor Manager and Endeavor Group Holdings are subject and certain other factors. Non pro-rata tax distributions may be paid to holders of Endeavor Profits Units. Further, there are no assurances that Endeavor Operating Company will make distributions sufficient to cover the taxes on its members allocable share of taxable income, and in some cases, Endeavor Operating Company may not make distributions sufficient for some or all of Endeavor Operating Company s equity holders to pay such taxes. The operating agreement of Endeavor Operating Company includes provisions that permit (at the direction of its managing member) Endeavor Operating Company to cap the tax distributions that it makes in respect of a particular period by reference to the aggregate taxable income and gain during such period and an assumed tax rate. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 Generally, we are required under the TRA to make payments to certain persons that held direct or indirect interest in EOC and UFC Parent prior to the IPO ("TRA Holders") that are generally equal to 85 of the applicable cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we realize or are deemed to realize (determined by using certain assumptions) or in some cases are deemed to realize as a result of favorable tax attributes that will be available to us as a result of certain transactions contemplated in connection with our IPO, exchanges of Endeavor Operating Company Units for Class A common stock or cash and payments made under the TRA. We will generally be entitled to retain the remaining 15 of these cash tax savings. Payments will be due only after we have filed our U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Payments under the TRA will bear interest from the due date of the tax return reflecting the applicable tax benefits. We currently expect to fund these payments from cash flows from operations generated by our subsidiaries as well as from excess tax distributions that we receive from our subsidiaries. The amounts payable under the TRA will vary depending upon a number of factors, including tax rates in effect, as well as the amount, character and timing of the taxable income of EGH in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had a TRA liability of 869.0 million recorded for all exchanges that have occurred as of this date. 
 Under the TRA, as a result of certain types of transactions or occurrences, including a transaction resulting in a Change of Control (as defined in the TRA) or a material breach of our obligations under the TRA, we may also be required to make payments to the TRA Holders in amounts equal to the present value of future payments we are obligated to make under the TRA, calculated utilizing assumptions set forth in the TRA. If the payments under the TRA are accelerated, we may be required to raise additional debt or equity to fund such payments. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA as a result of having insufficient funds (including because our credit agreements restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us) such payments will generally be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 For a description of our policies regarding our critical accounting estimates, see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 20, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates or the application or the results of the application of those policies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements from those previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 20, 2024. 
 Goodwill is tested annually as of October 1 for impairment and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. During the first and second quarter of 2024, we performed an interim impairment test for certain of our reporting units, the result of which was an impairment charge of 64.2 million and 141.7 million, respectively, recorded within our Sports Data Technology segment, which is presented as discontinued operations. Declines in the results of our reporting units could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in the future. 
 Recent Accounting Standards 
 See Note 3 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further information on certain accounting standards that have been recently adopted or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest rate risk 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the floating interest component on our long-term debt. The Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at floating rates and we regularly monitor and manage interest rate risks. Holding debt levels constant as of September 30, 2024, a 1 increase in the effective interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense by 50 million. 
 Foreign currency risk 
 We have operations in several countries outside of the United States, and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies, principally the British Pound and the Euro. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. These changes could adversely affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of our non-U.S. dollar revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content and services, all of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories. 
 Holding other variables constant (such as interest rates and debt levels), if the U.S. dollar appreciated by 10 against the foreign currencies used by our operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues would have decreased by approximately 126.8 million and operating loss would have improved by approximately 17.2 million. 
 We regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. 
 Credit risk 
 We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with various major banks and other high-quality financial institutions, and our deposits at these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions and, in the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents or any inability to access or delays in our ability to access our funds could adversely affect our business and financial position. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Pr oceedings 
 From time to time we may be involved in claims and proceedings arising in the course of our business. The outcome of any such claims or proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. For a description of our legal proceedings, see Note 18 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described as risk factors, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual operating results and financial condition to vary materially from past, or anticipated future, operating results and financial condition. For a discussion of these potential risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report and see Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024 , which risk factors from such Quarterly Reports are incorporated herein by reference, as supplemented by the risk factor below. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and the price of our common stock. Other than the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors to those included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 We may fail to complete the TKO Asset Acquisition if certain required conditions, many of which are outside our control, are not satisfied. 
 The completion of the TKO Asset Acquisition is subject to various customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) the absence of any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, ruling, stipulation, directive, assessment, subpoena, verdict, determination or award issued, promulgated or entered, by or with any governmental entity that has the effect of making the TKO Asset Acquisition illegal or otherwise restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the TKO Asset Acquisition, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 of the parties and (iii) compliance in all material respects by each party with its obligations under the transaction agreement. Despite the parties best efforts, we may not be able to satisfy the various closing conditions and obtain the necessary approvals in a timely fashion or at all. 
 Failure to complete the TKO Asset Acquisition or other dispositions we may contemplate could negatively impact our stock price, future business and financial results. 
 If the TKO Asset Acquisition or other dispositions we may contemplate is not completed, we will be subject to several risks, including the following: 
 payment for certain costs, whether or not the transaction is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees; 

negative reactions from the financial markets, including potential declines in the price of our Class A common stock due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the TKO Asset Acquisition or other dispositions we announce will be completed; 

diverted attention of our management to the dispositions rather than to our operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and 

negative impact on our future plans.
