 . The net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled . These matters, along
with the Company s lack of any viable business or material financing, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon acquiring a new business through a reverse merger transaction and generating sales and
obtaining additional capital and financing. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to acquire a profitable business
and raise the necessary financing, there can be no assurances to that effect. 

The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

OVERVIEW 

We are currently a shell company with no meaningful assets
or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We were incorporated in the State of Florida in
December 1993. Our current business office is located at 618 E South St, Suite 500, Orlando, FL 32801. Our Internet website address is www.imds.com . The
information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this Form 10-Q quarterly report. 

HISTORICAL ACTIVITES 

Imaging Diagnostic Systems, Inc. (the Company or IDSI was a medical technology company that developed a new, non-invasive CT scanner called Computed Tomography Laser Mammography (CTLM that used a laser beam in place of ionizing X-ray for breast imaging. This technology is called Diffuse Optical Tomography. The CTLM 
provided an adjunctive imaging modality to other methods of imaging the breast such as X-ray mammography, MRI and ultrasound. 

19 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company terminated its CTLM 
business due to the lack of financing and the absence of a realistic prospect of achieving profitability after accumulating huge operating
losses for many years. Since the beginning of fiscal 2024 the Company has been focused on seeking new business opportunities to replace
its failed legacy business through a reverse merger transaction. Entering into a reverse merger transaction would likely involve very
substantial dilution to the existing shareholders. It would, however, provide an opportunity to return some value to our shareholders.
While the Company has considered several opportunities, it has yet to enter into any definitive agreement and remains a shell company. 

Since inception in December 1993 as a Florida corporation and subsequently
its reverse merger with Alkan Corp., a New Jersey Corporation on April 14, 1994, we continued operations and changed our state of incorporation
from New Jersey to Florida, effective July 1, 1995. On August 28, 2018, we filed a Form 10 registration statement to register issued and
outstanding shares held by our shareholders and to become a fully reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act ). Our registration became effective on October 29, 2018. 

As of the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, we had recorded revenues of 10,648 from our operations and have incurred net losses applicable to common
shareholders since inception through September 30, 2024 of 136,214,684 after discounts and dividends on preferred stock. We incurred
net losses applicable to common shareholders of 164,221 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Since 2016, we have financed our operations through loans by Viable
International Investments LLC Viable ), a subsidiary of Sanya Wanbo (Viable) Investments, Ltd. Co. and its affiliates and
the private placement of common stock to Viable affiliates and independent Chinese investors. We do not have any formal financing arrangements
with Viable and its affiliates and there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive funding from Viable or another source. 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue
as a going concern. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we have incurred recurring operating losses and will have to obtain additional
capital to sustain operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 Going Concern and Management s Plans , in the Notes to
the Financial Statements. The accompanying financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

CURRENT BUSINESS 

We have had no material business operations since July 1, 2023. We
are currently seeking potential assets, property, or businesses to acquire, in a business combination, by reorganization, merger, or acquisition.
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not entered into any binding agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities
for us. We hope to continue to engage in discussions with other operating businesses regarding potential acquisition opportunities. There
is no assurance that any nonbinding term sheet will result in a definitive purchase transaction nor can we assure you that we will be
able to successfully acquire any company or business in the near future. 

We are not currently engaged in any substantive business activity except
the search for potential assets, property or businesses to acquire, and we have no current plans to engage in any other activity in the
foreseeable future unless and until we complete any such acquisition. In our present form, we are deemed to be a shell company 
seeking to acquire or merge with a business or company. We do not intend to restrict our search for business opportunities to any
particular business or industry, and the areas in which we will seek out business opportunities may include all lawful businesses. We
recognize that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to us will be extremely limited, and may be restricted
to businesses or entities that desire to become a publicly-held company while avoiding what many may deem to be the adverse factors related
to an initial public offering IPO as a method of going public. The most prevalent of these factors
include the substantial time requirements, legal and accounting costs, the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly
offer and sell securities on behalf of the particular entity, the lack of or the inability to obtain the required financial statements
for such an undertaking, state limitations on the amount of dilution to public investors in comparison to the stockholders of any such
entity, along with other conditions or requirements imposed by various federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations and federal
and state agencies that implement them. 

20 

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or
under the supervision of the Company s officers and directors. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing, and participating
in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential
acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors: 

Potential
 for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion, or new products; 

Competitive
 position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment
 as well as within the industry as a whole; 

Strength
 and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 

Capital
 requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from operations, through the
 sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements, or from other
 sources; 

The
 extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 

The
 accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional
 assistance and other required items; and 

Other
 relevant factors. 

In
applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances
and ma ke a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities
may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts
about the business to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review
of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel,
and financial resources. 

We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things,
meetings with the target business s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of
financial and other information, which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or
by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable
to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management
decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which,
if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided
by the promoters, owners, sponsors, or others associated with the target business seeking our participation. 

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business
and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred
with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result
in a loss to us. 

Additionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number
of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue
to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and
public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms,
are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly
greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage
in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce
the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination. 

21 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Such estimates and assumptions also include the valuations of certain financial instruments, stock-based compensation,
deferred tax assets, the outcome of litigation and tax matters, and other matters that affect the statements of financial condition and
related disclosures. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We rely on the guidance provided by ASC 718, Share Based Payments ).
ASC 718 requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards and applies to all outstanding and vested
stock-based awards. 

In computing the impact, the fair value of each option is estimated
on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk-free interest rate; volatility;
and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent
management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a
result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, the Company s stock-based compensation expense could be materially different
in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected
to vest. In estimating the Company s forfeiture rate, we analyzed its historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of unvested
options, and the amount of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different
from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly
different from what we have recorded in the current period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no stock options
were granted to employees or consultants. Those options are being expensed pursuant to ASC 718. 

The fair value concepts were not changed significantly in ASC 718;
however, in adopting this Standard, companies were given the option to choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions.
We elected to continue to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model and expense the options as compensation over the requisite service
period of the grant. We will reconsider use of the Black-Scholes model if additional information becomes available in the future that
indicates another model would be more appropriate, or if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that cannot be reasonably
estimated using this model. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Sales
and Cost of Sales 

Revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 10,648,
representing an increase of 10,648 from 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

The Cost of Sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 was 0. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
did not engage in any operational activities aimed at generating revenue. The Company did, however, recognize royalty revenues of 10,648
during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

22 

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 

Our general and administrative expenses include travel/subsistence
related to general and administrative activities, property and casualty insurance, professional fees associated with our corporate and
securities attorneys and independent auditors, corporate governance expenses, stockholder expenses, utilities, maintenance, telephones,
office supplies and sales and property taxes. 

General and administrative expenses during the three months ended September
30, 2024, were 107,664, representing an increase of 104,277 or 3,079 from 3,387 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

The general and administrative increase of 104,277 is due to the accounting,
legal, and filing fees related to the filing of the fiscal 2023 and 2024 Forms 10-K and the three fiscal 2024 Forms 10-Q during the three
months ended September 30, 2024, as well as work relating to potential new business opportunities. 

SALARIES AND WAGES 

Our salaries and wages expenses include compensation, related benefits,
payroll taxes and other payroll fees for all employees. 

Salaries and wages expense during the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 0. 

The lack of salaries and wages is due to the Company s decision
to furlough all employees on May 1, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Some of these individuals have worked as independent contractors
on an as-needed basis. Payments made to contractors are included in consulting expenses. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we incurred
research and development expenses to develop significant enhancements to our sole product, the CTLM . These expenses consisted primarily
of clinical costs, costs of materials and components to make product enhancements, new product research costs, and costs associated with
servicing clinical collaboration sites. 

Research and development expenses were 0 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The lack of any substantial research and development expenses during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was due to the Company s lack of operational activities. 

SALES AND MARKETING 

Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of expenses associated
with advertising and promotion, representative office expense, trade shows, conferences, promotional and training costs related to marketing
the CTLM , commissions, travel/subsistence, patent maintenance fees, consulting, certification expenses, and product liability insurance. 

Sales and marketing expenses during the three months ended September
30, 2024, were 252, representing a decrease of 203 or 45 from 455 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

All sales and marketing expenses during both the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 were related to fees for maintaining our website. The difference relates to variations in website related
fees between the two periods. 

23 

CONSULTING EXPENSES 

Our consulting expenses consists of all consulting fees paid as well
as share-based compensation issued to our consultants. Our share-based compensation expense consists of vested stock options expensed
under the Black-Scholes options pricing model. 

Consulting expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
were 41,825, representing an increase of 40,425 or 2,888 from 1,400 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

The increase in consulting expenses of 40,425 is due to fees paid
to consultants to assist with the filing of the fiscal 2023 and 2024 Forms 10-K and the three fiscal 2024 Forms 10-Q during the three
months ended September 30, 2024, as well as work relating to potential new business opportunities. 

AGGREGATE OPERATING EXPENSES 

Total operating expenses (general and administrative, salaries and
wages, research and development, sales and marketing, depreciation and amortization, and stock options) and cost of sales during the three
months ended September 30, 2024, were 149,741, representing an increase of 144,499 or 2,757 from 5,242 when compared to the operating
expenses and cost of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses is due primarily
to fees related to the filing of the fiscal 2023 and 2024 Forms 10-K and the three fiscal 2024 Forms 10-Q during the three months ended
September 30, 2024, as well as work relating to potential new business opportunities. 

Depreciation and amortization during the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, was 0. All fixed assets are fully depreciated and no additions were made during either fiscal quarter. Furthermore,
all fixed assets were disposed of on October 16, 2023. 

Interest expense for both of the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 was 20,603. Although the amount of outstanding debt at September 30, 2024 was higher than at September 30, 2023, the additional
debt consisted of 0 interest loans, which is why the amount of interest expense was the same. 

BALANCE SHEET DATA 

Our combined cash and cash equivalents totaled 5,005 at September
30, 2024 and 66 at June 30, 2024. 

Our current liabilities, which consist of accounts payable, accrued
payroll taxes and penalties, short term debt, current portion of long-term debt, and related party promissory notes and accrued interest
totaled 2,358,800 at September 30, 2024 and 2,183,639 at June 30, 2024. Accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled 714,630 at September
30, 2024 and 686,497 at June 30, 2024. Accrued payroll taxes and penalties totaled 314,019 at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.
Related party promissory notes totaled 904,462 at September 30, 2024 and 777,852 at June 30, 2024. Related party accrued interest totaled
 352,759 at September 30, 2024 and 332,341 at June 30, 2024. The PPP loan payable was 72,930 at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.
Current liabilities increased due to accounts payable and accrued expenses increasing by 28,133, related-party promissory notes increasing
by 126,610, and related party accrued interest increasing by 20,418. 

Our temporary equity, which consists of Convertible Preferred Series
L (including accrued dividends), totaled 474,488 at September 30, 2024 and 469,963 at June 30, 2024. The increase of 4,525 is due to
dividends for the three months ended September 30, 2024 that are being included in the total redemption value. 

24 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Due to the failure of our legacy business, we are a shell company focused
on seeking new business opportunities through a reverse merger transaction (a Merger ). Our continued existence is dependent
upon our ability to resolve our liquidity problems, principally by obtaining additional debt and/or equity financing and entering into
a Merger. While Viable has financed our operations since 2016, we do not have any formal financing arrangements with Viable and
its affiliates and there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive funding from Viable or another source. In the event that
we are unable to obtain adequate debt or equity financing or are unable to obtain such financing on terms and conditions acceptable to
us, we may have to cease or severely curtail our operations. This would materially impact our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We have financed our operating and research and development activities
through multiple private placements of common stock as well as short term loans from related parties. During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we received 126,610 through short-term related party loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received
 411 through short-term related party loans. 

Net cash used in operating activities was 121,671 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities and product development of the CTLM and related software
development of 1,315 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had negative working capital of
 2,343,094 compared to negative working capital of 2,183,398 at June 30, 2024. 

If additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities, including
in connection with a Merger, dilution to existing stockholders will result and future investors may be granted rights superior to those
of existing stockholders. 

Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Under the supervision and participation of
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or the persons
performing similar functions, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal year that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
