In accordance with ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors and ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishment, the Company performed an assessment of whether the transaction was deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring, and if no, whether the transaction was deemed modification of existing debt, or an extinguishment of existing debt and new debt. The October 2023 Amendment, April 2024 Amendment, May 2024 Amendment, and August 2024 Amendment were concluded to be a modification, and not an extinguishment, based on an analysis of the present value of future cash flows. A new effective interest rate was determined, and the debt continued to be amortized. The December 2023 Amendment was concluded to be an extinguishment, due to the addition of a substantive conversion option. As a result, the pre-amended debt carrying value was extinguished and the new debt was recorded at fair value, which is subsequently amortized using the effective interest method. Extinguishment charges were and recorded in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Company analyzed the conversion feature of the December 2023 Amendment for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15 and determined that the embedded conversion features should be classified as a bifurcated derivative because the exercise price of these convertible notes are subject to a variable conversion rate. The Company has determined that the conversion feature is not considered to be solely indexed to the Company s own stock and is therefore not afforded equity treatment. In accordance with ASC 815, the Company has bifurcated the conversion feature of the note and recorded a derivative liability at fair value in the amount of as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023 as a component of Other Long-Term Liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Litigation - The Company is subject to litigation arising from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The Company does not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal actions will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. As such, there can be no assurance that any pending legal action, which the Company currently believes to be immaterial, will not become material in the future. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Company, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. When a loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Company will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of related expenses. The Company will then continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of any such accrued liability.

Henry Sicignano, III, Richard M. Sanders, Joseph Alexander Dunn, Nora B. Sullivan, James W. Cornell, John T. Brodfuehrer and 22nd Century Group, Inc., Case No. 1:19 cv 00748.

Numerous other shareholder derivative cases were subsequently filed and consolidated into the main action. On December 5, 2023, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Settlement to fully resolve all claims pending the Court s approval of a motion for preliminary approval of settlement.

For the third quarter 2024, cigarette sales benefitted from strong summer seasonal demand with key customers and price increases that took effect in April 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, volume decreases were result of prior year comparable period stocking orders of Pinnacle cigarettes launched in a top-five convenience store chain and a large one-time order of export product . For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, filtered cigars net revenues decreased to 1,664 and 8,592, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, reflecting lower volumes as the Company continues to transition away from low or negative margin manufacturing agreements- in favor of higher margin cigarette manufacturing agreements. Cigarillo distribution net revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 amounted to 204 and 756, respectively, reflective of the expanded Pinnacle branded product offerings launched in April 2024 with a top-five national convenience store chain. VLN cigarette net revenues were negligible in the third quarter 2024 and 70 for the first nine months of 2024, a decrease from the comparable prior year periods which benefited from stocking orders with major c-stores. While the Company has secured broad distribution of its VLN products, the sell-through has not yet materialized. The Company is currently making changes to rebrand and relaunch its VLN products.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expect to incur additional losses until such time that we can generate significant revenue and profit in our tobacco business. We had negative cash flow from operations of 9,947 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an accumulated deficit of 389,315 as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 5,341 and working capital from continuing operations of 1,568 (compared to working capital deficit from continuing operations of 6,826) at December 31, 2023). Given our projected operating requirements and existing cash and cash equivalents, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through one year following the date that the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein are issued. In response to these conditions, management is currently evaluating different strategies for reducing expenses, as well as pursuing financing strategies which include raising additional funds through the issuance of securities, asset sales, and through arrangements with strategic partners. If capital is not available to the Company when, and in the amounts needed, it could be required to liquidate inventory or assets, cease or curtail operations, seek to negotiate new business deals with our business partners or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws or similar state proceedings. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the capital it needs to continue operations. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue in operations. Management s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through one year following the date that the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. Our cash, and cash equivalents and working capital from continuing operations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are set forth below:

This increase in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in net current liabilities of 8,705 offset by a decrease of 311 in net current assets. Cash and cash equivalents increased by 3,283 and the remaining net current assets decreased by 3,594. As a result of the working capital balance, management has taken a number of steps to improve liquidity. Refer below to Cash demands on operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Making estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Management believes the estimates, assumptions and judgments employed and resulting balances reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ materially. There have been no material changes to the information set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, SEC, or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for additional information about these recently issued accounting standards and their potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no material changes to the information set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act reports are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q to ensure information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified by SEC rules, based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings See Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies Litigation - to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for information concerning our on-going litigation. In addition to the lawsuits described in Note 12, from time to time we may be involved in claims arising in the ordinary course of business. To our knowledge other than the cases described in Note 12 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, no material legal proceedings, governmental actions, investigations or claims are currently pending against us or involve us that, in the opinion of our management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Item 1A. Risk Factors Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024 . Our securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; a determination that shares of our Class A common stock are penny stock which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares; a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. As previously disclosed, on July 16, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department indicating that for the last 30 consecutive business days our common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 Minimum Bid Price Requirement per share for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), if during the 180 calendar days following the date of the notification, or prior to January 13, 2025, the closing bid price of our stock is at or above 1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) by January 13, 2025, the Company may be afforded a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. If we fail to evidence compliance with Nasdaq listing rules, we will be delisted and we could face significant adverse consequences. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None Item 3. Default Upon Senior Securities. None Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures None
