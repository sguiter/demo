FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (including information incorporated by reference) contains statements that express management s opinions,
expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or
may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, 
 plans, believes, could, would, seeks, estimates, 
and variations of such words and similar expressions, and the negatives thereof, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and are not guarantees of future performance and involve
certain risks, uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions by management that are difficult to predict. Various factors, some of which
are beyond the Company s control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such
forward-looking statements. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date of this report, except as may otherwise be required by the federal securities laws. 

Forward-looking
statements necessarily involve risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking
statements due to a number of factors. These statements include statements about, among other things: the timing and outcome of the FDA s
review of our Biologics License Application resubmission for pz-cel; our plans to continue development of AAV-based gene therapies designed
to treat ophthalmic diseases; the achievement of or expected timing, progress and results of clinical development, clinical trials and
potential regulatory approvals; our pipeline of product candidates; our belief that pz-cel could potentially benefit patients with RDEB;
our belief in the adequacy of the clinical trial data from our VIITAL clinical trial, together with the data generated in the
program to date, to support regulatory approvals; our dependence upon our third-party customers and vendors and their compliance with
regulatory bodies; our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements, and needs for additional financing; our intellectual
property position and our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection and exclusivity for our proprietary
assets; our estimates regarding the size of the potential markets for our product candidates, the strength of our commercialization strategies
and our ability to serve and supply those markets; and future economic conditions or performance. 

Important
factors that could affect performance and cause results to differ materially from management s expectations are described in
the sections entitled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as
updated from time to time in the Company s SEC filings, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These factors include:
the timing and outcome of the FDA s review of our resubmission of the Biologics License Application for pz-cel; our ability to
access our existing at-the-market sale agreement; our ability to access additional financial resources and/or our financial
flexibility to reduce operating expenses if required; our ability to obtain additional equity funding from current or new
stockholders; the potential impacts of global healthcare emergencies, such as pandemics, on our business, operations, and financial
condition; our ability to out-license technology and/or other assets, deferring and/or eliminating planned expenditures,
restructuring operations and/or reducing headcount, and sales of assets; the dilutive effect that raising additional funds by
selling additional equity securities would have on the relative equity ownership of our existing investors, including under our
existing at-the-market sale agreement; the outcome of any interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA or other regulatory agencies relating to any of our products or product candidates; our ability to continue to
secure and maintain regulatory designations for our product candidates; our ability to develop manufacturing capabilities compliant
with current good manufacturing practices for our product candidates; our ability to manufacture cell and gene therapy products and
produce an adequate product supply to support clinical trials and potential future commercialization; the rate and degree of market
acceptance of our product candidates for any indication once approved; and our ability to meet our obligations contained in license
agreements to which we are party.

Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

million and million for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million. To date
the Company has not generated any significant revenues and expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future.
As of the issuance date of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company expects that its existing
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of million as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to
fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of these condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

While
the Company believes its capital resources are sufficient to fund the Company s on-going operations for the next 12 months from
the issuance date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company s liquidity could be materially affected
over this period by: (1) its ability to raise additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings, or other non-dilutive third-party
funding; (2) costs associated with new or existing strategic alliances, or licensing and collaboration arrangements; (3) negative regulatory
events or unanticipated costs related to pz-cel; (4) any other unanticipated material negative events or costs. One or more of these
events or costs could materially affect the Company s liquidity. If the Company is unable to meet its obligations when they become
due, the Company may have to delay expenditures, reduce the scope of its research and development programs, or make significant changes
to its operating plan. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

million and million, respectively. 

or less per share. The Company does not include the potential impact of dilutive securities in diluted net loss per share,
as the impact of these items is anti-dilutive. Potential dilutive securities result from outstanding restricted stock, stock options,
conversion features of loan agreements, and stock purchase warrants. 

The
following table sets forth the potential securities that could potentially dilute basic loss per share in the future that were not included
in the computation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented: 

Shares of common stock underlying restricted stock 

Shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of conversion feature of loan agreement 

Shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants 

Total 

In
January 2024 as part of the Loan and Security Agreement, see Note 8, the Company issued warrants to purchase worth of shares
of the Company s stock which have an exercise price equal to the lesser of (i) and (ii) the price per share of the Company s
net bona fide round of equity financing before September 30, 2024 (the 2024 Loan Agreement Warrants ). In connection with
the underwritten common stock offering consummated on May 7, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Loan Agreement Warrants, the exercise
price was reduced to per share and the shares issuable was calculated at shares. On September 30, 2024, per the terms of
the 2023 Loan Agreement Warrants, the exercise price and the number of shares became set at per share and shares, respectively.
The Company included these shares in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as shares of common stock issuable upon exercise
of warrants in the table above and no shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

As

carries its available-for-sale securities at fair value in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2024, were not significant and were primarily due to changes in interest rates, including
market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities. None of the short-term investments
have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. Accordingly, no other-than-temporary impairment was recorded
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Outstanding warrant liabilities 

The
common stock warrants related to the 2021 Public Offering and the 2022 Private Placement are not indexed to the Company s own
stock and therefore have been classified as liabilities at their estimated fair value. The common stock warrants issued in
connection with the Loan Agreement issuance were determined to be liability classified under ASC 815 as the common stock warrants
were not considered indexed to the Company s stock. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is recorded
as changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 

In
January 2024 as part of the Loan and Security Agreement, see Note 8, the Company issued warrants to purchase worth of shares
of the Company s stock which have an exercise price equal to the lesser of (i) and (ii) the price per share of the Company s
next bona fide round of equity financing before September 30, 2024 (the 2024 Loan Agreement Warrants ). In connection with
the underwritten common stock offering consummated on May 7, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Loan Agreement Warrants, the exercise
price of was reduced to per share and the shares issuable was calculated at shares. On September 30, 2024, per the terms
of the 2023 Loan Agreement Warrants, the exercise price and the number of shares became set at per share and shares, respectively. 

Fair value of warrants issued in connection with the Loan Agreement 

Loss recognized in earnings from change in fair value 

Warrant liabilities as of September 30, 2024 

The
warrant liabilities are valued using significant inputs not observable in the market. Accordingly, the warrant liability is measured
at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs and are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. Fair
value measurements categorized within Level 3 are sensitive to changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value
and such changes could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value. The Company s valuation of the common stock
warrants utilized the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporated assumptions and estimates to value the common stock warrants.
The Company assessed these assumptions and estimates at the end of each reporting period.

Derivative
Liabilities 

The
Conversion Right embedded within the Loan Agreement (see Note 8 below) required bifurcation as certain adjustments to the conversion
price were not indexed to the Company s own stock and therefore the Conversion Right was recorded as a derivative liability. The
derivative liability is remeasured at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded to changes in fair value of warrants
and derivative liabilities in the condensed consolidated statement of operations until the derivative is exercised, expired, reclassified,
or otherwise settled. 

On
September 30, 2024, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the conversion price was fixed at and is considered indexed to the Company s
own stock. At September 30, 2024, the Conversion Right no longer met the criteria of a derivative liability and the derivative liability
was reclassified to equity.

The
derivative liabilities are valued using significant inputs not observable in the market. Accordingly, the derivative liability is measured
at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs and are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. Fair
value measurements categorized within Level 3 are sensitive to changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value
and such changes could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value. The Company s valuation of the derivatives
utilized the Monte Carlo simulation model, which incorporated assumptions and estimates to value the derivatives. The Company assessed
these assumptions and estimates at the end of each reporting period.

 Agreement with Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, as administrative agent and
collateral agent Avenue and the Agent and Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership Avenue 2 and, together with Avenue, the Lenders ). Also on January 8, 2024, the
Company entered into a Supplement to the Agreement (collectively with the Agreement, the Loan Agreement with the
Agent and the Lenders. The Loan Agreement provides for senior secured term loans (the Loans in an aggregate principal
amount up to 
million, with (i) a committed tranche of 
million advanced on the Closing Date Tranche 1 ), (ii) a committed tranche of up to 
million which may be advanced upon the request of the Company between June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, subject to the Company
obtaining FDA approval of pz-cel in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, with the issuance of a Priority Review Voucher Tranche 2 ), and (iii) a discretionary tranche of up to 
million which may be advanced between March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2026 (the Discretionary Tranche provided at the
discretion of the Lenders. The Loans are due and payable on July 1, 2027 (the Maturity Date ). As of September 30, 2024, the Tranche 2 is no longer available as the Company did not meet the Tranche 2 criteria. 

The
Loan principal is repayable in equal monthly installments beginning on April 8, 2025, with the possibility of deferring principal payments
an additional nine to fifteen months contingent upon (i) the Company obtaining FDA approval of pz-cel in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis
bullosa, with the issuance of a Priority Review Voucher and (ii) the Company raising million of cumulative equity and/or non-dilutive
capital subsequent to the Closing Date. The Loans bear interest at a rate per annum (subject to increase during an event of default)
equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal from time to time, plus and (ii) . The
stated interest rate and effective interest rate as of September 30, 2024 was and , respectively. 

The
Company may, subject to certain parameters, voluntarily prepay the Loans, in whole, at any time. If prepayment occurs on or before the
one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, 

The
Company s obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the Company s assets. Pursuant
to the Loan Agreement, the Company is subject to a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain at all times million in unrestricted
cash. The Loan Agreement also contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things,
limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt, guarantees or liens (ii) pay dividends 
(iii) enter into certain change of control transactions (iv) sell, transfer, lease, license, or otherwise dispose of certain assets 
(v) make certain investments or loans and (vi) engage in certain transactions with related persons, in each case, subject to certain
exceptions. The Loan Agreement also includes events of default customary for financings of this type, in certain cases subject to customary
periods to cure, following which the Agent may accelerate all amounts outstanding under the Loans. 

Pursuant
to the Supplement to the Loan and Security Agreement, Avenue also has the right to convert up to million of the outstanding principal
of the Loans into shares of Company common stock (the Conversion Right at a price per share equal to 120 of the exercise
price of the Warrants (further discussed below) at any time while the Loans are outstanding, subject to certain terms and conditions,
including ownership limitations. The Conversion Right required bifurcation as certain adjustments to the conversion price were not indexed
to the Company s own stock and therefore the Conversion Right was recorded as a derivative liability. On January 8, 2024, the Conversion
Right was recorded at the closing date fair value of million which was based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. The derivative liability
is remeasured at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded to change in fair value of warrants and derivative liabilities
in the condensed consolidated statement of operations until the derivative is exercised, expired, reclassified, or otherwise settled.
On September 30, 2024, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the conversion price was fixed at and is considered indexed to the Company s
own stock. At September 30, 2024, the Conversion Right no longer met the criteria of a derivative liability and the derivative liability
was reclassified to equity. 

In
addition, subject to applicable law and specified provisions set forth in the Supplement to the Loan and Security Agreement and solely
to the extent permitted under applicable stock exchange rules without requiring stockholder approval, the Lenders may participate in
certain equity financing transactions of the Company in an aggregate amount of up to million on the same terms, conditions and pricing
offered by the Company to other investors participating in such financing transactions (such right, the Participation Right ).

warrants expire on December 21, 2026. During such time as each warrant is outstanding, the holder of the warrant is entitled to participate
in any dividends or other distribution of assets to holders of shares of common stock. There was no warrant activity during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, other than the change in fair value of the warrants for the stock purchase warrants issued as part of
this public offering.

Common
Stock Warrants related to the Loan and Security Agreement 

On
January 8, 2024, in connection with entering into the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company issued to each of Avenue and Avenue 2
(collectively, the Warrantholders warrants to purchase up to and worth of shares, respectively, of
Company common stock (collectively, the January Warrants ). The Warrants expire on January 8, 2029 (the Expiration

Company s next bona fide round of equity financing before September 30, 2024 in which the Company sells or issues shares of its
common stock, excluding certain excluded issuances as defined in the Supplement. In connection with the underwritten common stock offering
consummated on May 7, 2024, and pursuant to the term of the January Warrants, the exercise price of the January Warrants was reduced
to per share for shares. In addition, upon a change of control where the per share price of the Company common stock is
less than or equal to two times that of the exercise price, the Warrantholders would be entitled to receive the shares of common stock
underlying the January Warrants without payment of the exercise price. On January 8, 2024, the January Warrants did not include an explicit
share limit and the number of shares issuable under the warrant agreements were variable based on the exercise price and therefore the
January Warrants were liability classified based on a Black-Scholes valuation in accordance with ASC 815 and were recorded at the closing
date fair value of million which was based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model. On September 30, 2024, per the terms of the
January Warrants, the exercise price and the number of shares issuable became set at per share and shares, respectively. 

The
Warrantholders may exercise the January Warrants at any time, or from time to time up to and including the Expiration Date, by making
a cash payment equal to the exercise price multiplied by the quantity of shares. The Warrantholders may also exercise the January Warrants
on a cashless basis by receiving a net number of shares calculated pursuant to the formula set forth in the January Warrants. The January
Warrants are subject to anti-dilution adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, and reverse stock splits.

under the 2023 Incentive Plan. In addition, in 2023, the Company s board of directors approved various restricted stock awards
granted to certain new hires as inducement grants. On October 10, 2023, the Company s board of directors approved the Abeona Therapeutics
Inc. 2023 Employment Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan ). As of September 30, 2024, there were 
shares available to be granted under the Inducement Plan. 

General and administrative 

Total stock-based compensation expense 

Stock
Options 

The
Company estimates the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company
then recognize the grant date fair value of each option as compensation expense ratably using the straight-line attribution method over
the service period (generally the vesting period). The Black-Scholes model incorporates the following assumptions: 

Expected
 volatility the Company estimates the volatility of the share price at the date of grant using a look-back period
 which coincides with the expected term, defined below. The Company believes using a look-back period which coincides
 with the expected term is the most appropriate measure for determining expected volatility. 

Expected
 term the Company estimates the expected term using the simplified method, as outlined in SEC Staff Accounting
 Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment. 

Risk-free
 interest rate the Company estimates the risk-free interest rate using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to
 the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant. 

Dividends
 the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero because the Company has not declared nor paid a cash dividend, nor are
 there any plans to declare a dividend. 

The
Company did not grant any stock options in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The
Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur, which may result in the reversal of compensation costs in subsequent periods as the forfeitures
arise.

The
aggregate intrinsic value of options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the fair
value of the Company s common stock for those options that had exercise prices lower than the fair value of the Company s

million of fixed consideration, (ii) up to million of variable consideration
in the form of event-based milestone payments, (iii) up to million of variable consideration in the form of sales-based milestone
payments, and (iv) other royalty-based payments based on net sales. The event-based milestone payments are based on certain development
and regulatory events occurring. At inception, the Company evaluated whether the milestone conditions had been achieved and if it was
probable that a significant cumulative revenue reversal would not occur before recognizing the associated revenue and determined that
these milestone payments were not within the Company s control or the licensee s control, such as regulatory approvals, and
were not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals were received. Accordingly, at inception, the Company fully constrained
the million of event-based milestone payments until such time that it is probable that significant cumulative revenue reversal
would not occur. The sales-based milestone payments and other royalty-based payments are based on a level of sales for which the license
is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate. The Company will recognize revenue for these payments at the later
of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has
been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, the Company has not recognized any sales-based or royalty revenue resulting from this
licensing arrangement. 

Under
this arrangement, the Company recognized revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company does t have any contract assets or contract liabilities as a result of this transaction. 

Sublicense
Agreement Relating to Rett Syndrome 

In
October 2020, the Company entered into a sublicense agreement with Taysha for a gene therapy for Rett syndrome, including intellectual
property related to MECP2 gene constructs and regulation of their expression. The agreement grants Taysha worldwide exclusive rights
to intellectual property developed by scientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Edinburgh and
the Company, and the Company s know-how relating to the research, development, and manufacture of the gene therapy for Rett syndrome
and MECP2 gene constructs and regulation of their expression. 

The
Company assessed the nature of the promised license to determine whether the license has significant stand-alone functionality and evaluated
whether such functionality can be retained without ongoing activities by the Company and determined that the license has significant
stand-alone functionality. Furthermore, the Company has no ongoing activities associated with the license to support or maintain the
license s utility. Based on this, the Company determined that the pattern of transfer of control of the license to Taysha was at
a point in time. 

The
transaction price of the contract includes (i) million of fixed consideration, (ii) up to million of variable consideration
in the form of event-based milestone payments, (iii) up to million of variable consideration in the form of sales-based milestone
payments, and (iv) other royalty-based payments based on net sales. The event-based milestone payments are based on certain development
and regulatory events occurring. The Company evaluated whether the milestone conditions have been achieved and if it is probable that
a significant cumulative revenue reversal would not occur before recognizing the associated revenue. The Company determined that these
milestone payments are not within the Company s control or the licensee s control, such as regulatory approvals, and are
not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. Accordingly, the Company has fully constrained the 
million in event-based milestone payments until such time that it is probable that a significant cumulative revenue reversal would not
occur. The sales-based milestone payments and other royalty-based payments are based on a level of sales for which the license is deemed
to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate. The Company will recognize revenue for these payments at the later of (i) when
the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied
or partially satisfied. To date, the Company has not recognized any sales-based or royalty revenue resulting from this licensing arrangement. 

Under
this arrangement, the Company recognized nil and million in revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively based on event-based-milestone payments. The Company has no contract assets or contract liabilities as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as a result of this transaction. 

Ultragenyx
License Agreement 

On
May 16, 2022, the Company and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. Ultragenyx entered into an exclusive license agreement (the
 License Agreement for AAV gene therapy, ABO-102, for the treatment of Sanfilippo syndrome type A MPS IIIA ).
Under the License Agreement, Ultragenyx assumed responsibility for the ABO-102 program from the Company, with the exclusive right to
develop, manufacture, and commercialize ABO-102 worldwide. Also pursuant to the License Agreement, following regulatory approval, the
Company is eligible to receive tiered royalties from mid-single-digit up to 10 on net sales and up to million in commercial milestone
payments. Both forms of consideration comprise the transaction price to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring
the related intellectual property and certain, contractually-specified, transition services to Ultragenyx. The sales-based royalty and
milestone payments are subject to the royalty recognition constraint. As such, these fees are not recognized as revenue until the later
of: (a) the occurrence of the subsequent sale, and (b) the performance obligation to which they relate has been satisfied. 

Additionally,
pursuant to the License Agreement, Ultragenyx will reimburse the Company for certain development and transition costs actually incurred
by the Company. These costs are passed through to Ultragenyx without mark-up. The Company has determined that these costs are not incurred
for the purpose of satisfying any performance obligation under the License Agreement. Accordingly, the reimbursement of these costs is
recognized as a reduction of research and development costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company does not have
any contract assets or contract liabilities as a result of this transaction.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ). This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those described under Forward-Looking
Statements, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report, our actual
results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

OVERVIEW 

Abeona
is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening diseases. Our lead clinical program
is pz-cel, investigational autologous, COL7A1 gene-corrected epidermal sheets, currently in development for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis
bullosa RDEB ). In 2022, we announced positive data from the VIITAL study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability
of pz-cel. The VIITAL study met both its two co-primary efficacy endpoints demonstrating statistically significant, clinically
meaningful improvements in wound healing and pain reduction in large chronic RDEB wounds. On September 25, 2023, we submitted a Biologics
License Application BLA for pz-cel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ). 

In
November 2023, the FDA accepted and granted priority review for our BLA for pz-cel, and subsequently, under the Prescription Drug User
Fee Act PDUFA ), the FDA set a target action date of May 25, 2024. In April 2024, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter CRL in response to the BLA. The CRL noted that certain additional information needed to satisfy the Chemistry Manufacturing
and Controls CMC requirements of the pz-cel BLA must be satisfactorily resolved before the application can be approved.
The CRL did not identify any deficiencies related to the clinical efficacy or clinical safety data in the BLA, and the FDA did not request
any new clinical trials or clinical data to support the approval of pz-cel. On August 8, 2024, we completed a Type A Meeting with the
FDA to discuss our forthcoming resubmission of our BLA and on October 28, 2024, we resubmitted our BLA. The FDA notified the Company on November 8, 2024 that the BLA was accepted
for review, with an assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act PDUFA target action date of April 29, 2025. 

We
have continued to prepare our current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMP commercial facility in Cleveland, Ohio for manufacturing
pz-cel drug product to support our planned commercial launch of pz-cel, if approved. Pz-cel study drug product for all our VIITAL 
study participants has been manufactured at our Cleveland facility. As part of our commercial planning, we continue to engage with stakeholders
across the healthcare system, including public and private payors, and healthcare providers to better understand market access and potential
pricing for pz-cel. We have also begun discussions with high volume treatment centers of excellence to onboard them for pz-cel application
upon potential FDA approval. 

Our
development portfolio also features adeno-associated virus AAV based gene therapies designed to treat ophthalmic diseases
using the novel AIM capsids that we have exclusively licensed from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and developed
internally through our AAV vector research programs. 

Preclinical
Pipeline 

Our
preclinical programs are investigating the use of novel AAV capsids in AAV-based therapies for serious genetic eye diseases, including
ABO-504 for Stargardt disease, ABO-503 for X-linked retinoschisis XLRS and ABO-505 for autosomal dominant optic atrophy ADOA ). We completed pre-Investigational New Drug Application pre-IND meetings with the FDA regarding the
preclinical development plans and regulatory requirements to support first-in-human trials.

Other
Recent Developments 

On
October 18, 2024, we signed a lease for 16,566 square feet of office space at 6700 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio. The lease
commences on January 1, 2025 and the lease term matches the term for our existing 6555 Carnegie Avenue facility. The additional
space at the 6700 Euclid Avenue facility will allow us to convert office space at the 6555 Carnegie Avenue facility into additional
manufacturing space to increase pz-cel manufacturing capacity.

Research
and development expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and personnel expense, lab supplies, preclinical and development costs,
clinical trial costs, manufacturing and manufacturing facility costs, costs associated with regulatory approvals, depreciation on lab
supplies and manufacturing facilities, and consultant-related expenses. 

Total
research and development spending for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.9 million, as compared to 7.1 million for the
same period of 2023, an increase of 1.8 million. The increase in expenses was primarily due to: 

increased
 salary and related costs of 0.7 million; 

increased
 clinical and development work for our cell and gene therapy product candidates of 0.7 million which was due to the work on our BLA
 resubmission; and 

increased
 other costs of 0.4 million. 

We
expect our research and development activities to continue as we work towards advancing our product candidates towards potential regulatory
approval, reflecting costs associated with the following: 

employee
 and consultant-related expenses; 

preclinical
 and developmental costs; 

clinical
 trial costs; 

the
 cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and 

costs
 associated with regulatory approvals. 

25 

General
and administrative 

General
and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll and personnel costs, office facility costs, public reporting company related
costs, professional fees (e.g., legal expenses), pre-commercial launch activity costs and other general operating expenses not otherwise
included in research and development expenses. 

Total
general and administrative expenses were 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.2 million for
the same period of 2023, an increase of 2.2 million. The increase in expenses was primarily due to: 

increased
 salary and related costs of 0.9 million; 

increased
 pre-commercial preparation costs of 0.6 million; 

increased
 non-cash stock-based compensation of 0.1 million; and 

increased
 other costs such as professional fees and recruiting of 0.6 million. 

Interest
income 

Interest
income was 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.6 million in the same period of 2023. The increase
resulted from higher earnings on short-term investments driven by higher interest rates and increased average short-term investment balances. 

Interest
expense 

Interest
expense was 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.1 million in the same period of 2023. The increase
was primarily due to the credit facility entered into by the Company in January 2024, resulting in recognized interest expense of 1.0
million. 

Change
in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities 

The change in fair value of warrant and derivative
liabilities was a loss of 15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a loss of 1.1 million for the same
period in 2023. 

We
issued stock purchase warrants that are required to be classified as a liability and valued at fair market value at each reporting period.
In addition, the conversion feature in our loan agreement is required to be classified as a liability and valued at fair market value
at each reporting period. The change in the fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities was primarily due to the increase in our
stock price year over the year offset by a reduced term of each of the warrants and derivative liabilities. 

Other
income 

Other
income was 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.1 million in the same period of 2023. There
was no change in period over period.

License
and other revenues 

License
and other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was nil as compared to 3.5 million for the same period of 2023. The
revenue in 2023 consists of revenue resulting from achieving clinical milestones under a sublicense agreement we entered into with Taysha
in October 2020 relating to an investigational AAV-based gene therapy for Rett syndrome. 

Royalties 

Total
royalty expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was nil as compared to 1.6 million for the same period of 2023. The royalty
expense in 2023 was due to royalties owed to our licensors resulting from the milestones due from Taysha related to Rett. 

Research
and development 

Total
research and development spending for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.4 million, as compared to 23.7 million for the
same period of 2023, an increase of 1.7 million. The increase in expenses was primarily due to: 

increased
 salary and related costs of 3.6 million, partially offset by: 

decreased
 costs of clinical, development and regulatory work for our pz-cel product candidate and its associated BLA submission and resubmission
 and other related costs of 1.9 million. 

General
and administrative 

Total
general and administrative expenses were 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13.2 million for
the same period of 2023, an increase of 9.0 million. The increase in expenses was primarily due to: 

increased
 salary and related costs of 2.9 million; 

increased
 pre-commercial preparation costs of 3.1 million; 

increased
 non-cash stock-based compensation of 1.1 million; and 

increased
 other costs such as professional fees, legal and recruiting of 1.9 million. 

27 

Gain
of right-of-use lease assets 

The
gain on right-of-use lease assets was 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain on right-of-use assets for
2023 was related to the termination of our operating leases for office space that we no longer use, resulting in a gain from the difference
of the right-of-use lease assets and the lease liabilities. There was no such gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Interest
income 

Interest
income was 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.4 million in the same period of 2023. The increase
resulted from higher earnings on short-term investments driven by higher interest rates and increased average short-term investment balances. 

Interest
expense 

Interest
expense was 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.3 million in the same period of 2023. The increase
was primarily due to the credit facility entered into by the Company in January 2024, resulting in recognized interest expense of 2.7
million. 

Change
in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities 

The
change in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities was a loss of 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

We
issued stock purchase warrants that are required to be classified as a liability and valued at fair market value at each reporting period.
In addition, the conversion feature in our loan agreement is required to be classified as a liability and valued at fair market value
at each reporting period. The change in the fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities was primarily due to the increase in our
stock price year over the year offset by a reduced term of each of the warrants and derivative liabilities. 

Other
income 

Other
income was 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.7 million in the same period of 2023. The change
was primarily a result of 2.1 million in other income related to the impact of the employee retention tax credit that was recorded in
2023.

of 54.4 million and decreases in operating assets and liabilities of 0.5 million and net non-cash charges of 15.5 million. Non-cash
charges consisted primarily of 7.5 million of the change in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities, 4.7 million of stock-based

Net
cash used in operating activities was 27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily comprised of our net loss

Investing
activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 58.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily comprised of proceeds from
maturities of short-term investments of 90.2 million, offset by purchases of short-term investments of 146.5 million and capital expenditures
of 1.8 million. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily comprised of proceeds from
maturities of short-term investments of 37.0 million and proceeds from disposal of property and equipment of 0.2 million, offset by
purchases of short-term investments of 48.2 million and capital expenditures of 0.3 million. 

Financing
activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 98.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily comprised of 70.2 million
in net proceeds from sales of common stock, 10.0 million from open market sales of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement (as defined
below) and net proceeds of 19.0 million from our January 2024 Loan Agreement. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 29.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily comprised of proceeds
of 23.0 million from our direct placement offering and 6.6 million from open market sales of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement
(as defined below). 

We
have historically funded our operations primarily through sales of common stock. 

Our
principal source of liquidity is cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments, collectively referred to as our
cash resources. As of September 30, 2024, our cash resources were 110.0 million. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents,
restricted cash and short-term investments are sufficient to fund operations through at least the next 12 months from the date of this
report on Form 10-Q. We may need to secure additional funding to carry out all of our planned research and development and potential
commercialization activities. If we are unable to obtain additional financing or generate license or product revenue, the lack of liquidity
and sufficient capital resources could have a material adverse effect on our future prospects. 

We
have an open market sale agreement with Jefferies LLC (as amended, the ATM Agreement pursuant to which, we may sell from
time to time, through Jefferies LLC, shares of our common stock for an aggregate sales price of up to 75.0 million. Any sales of shares
pursuant to this agreement are made under our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that is on file with and
has been declared effective by the SEC. We sold 1,902,376 shares of our common stock under the ATM Agreement and received 10.0 million
of net proceeds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Since
our inception, we have incurred negative cash flows from operations and have expended, and expect to continue to expend, substantial
funds to complete our planned product development and potential commercialization efforts. We have not been profitable since inception
and to date have received limited revenues from the sale of products or licenses. We expect to incur losses for the next several years
as we continue to invest in commercialization, product research and development, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and regulatory
compliance and cannot provide assurance that we will ever be able to generate sufficient product sales or royalty revenue to achieve
profitability on a sustained basis, or at all. 

If
we raise additional funds by selling additional equity securities, the relative equity ownership of our existing investors will be diluted,
and the new investors could obtain terms more favorable than previous investors. If we raise additional funds through collaborations,
strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future
revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable
to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, or terminate our product
development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates to third parties
that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 

29 

Our
future capital requirements and adequacy of available funds depend on many factors, including: 

the
 successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our cell and gene therapy and other product candidates; 

the
 ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with corporate partners for the research, development, and commercialization
 of products; 

continued
 scientific progress in our research and development programs; 

the
 magnitude, scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials; 

the
 costs involved in filing, prosecuting, and enforcing patent claims; 

the
 costs involved in conducting clinical trials; 

competing
 technological developments; 

the
 cost of manufacturing and scale-up; 

the
 ability to establish and maintain effective commercialization arrangements and activities; and 

the
 successful outcome of our regulatory filings. 

Due
to uncertainties and certain of the risks described above, our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, our ability
to obtain applicable regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our ability to obtain necessary additional capital to fund
operations in the future, our ability to successfully manufacture our products and our product candidates in clinical quantities or for
commercial purposes, government regulation to which we are subject, the uncertainty associated with preclinical and clinical testing,
intense competition that we face, the potential necessity of licensing technology from third parties and protection of our intellectual
property, it is not possible to reliably predict future spending or time to completion by project or product category or the period in
which material net cash inflows from significant projects are expected to commence. If we are unable to timely complete a particular
project, our research and development efforts could be delayed or reduced, our business could suffer depending on the significance of
the project and we might need to raise additional capital to fund operations, as discussed in the risks above. 

We
plan to continue our policy of investing any available funds in suitable certificates of deposit, money market funds, government securities
and investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. We do not invest in derivative financial instruments. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management
considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: 

it
 requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 

changes
 in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact in our results of operations or
 financial condition. 

While
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. For a discussion of the critical accounting estimates
that affect the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, see Critical Accounting Estimates included in Item
7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report as
well as the discussion below related to our derivative liability. 

See
Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. 

Derivative
Liability 

We
account for the fair value of the conversion right embedded within the loan agreement in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815, which
requires us to bifurcate and separately account for the conversion feature as an embedded derivative contained in our loan agreement.
Accordingly, we account for the conversion feature as a derivative liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Derivatives
are measured at their fair value on the balance sheet. In determining the appropriate fair value, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model,
which incorporated assumptions and estimates to value the derivatives. The derivative liability is remeasured at each reporting period
with the change in fair value recorded to change in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities in the condensed consolidated statement
of operations until the derivative is exercised, expired, reclassified, or otherwise settled.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our
business and financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. As a result, the risks and uncertainties discussed in
Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 should be carefully considered. 

The
Complete Response Letter related to our Biologics License Application for pz-cel for the treatment of patients with recessive dystrophic
epidermolysis bullosa may impair our ability to successfully commercialize pz-cel. 

On
April 16, 2024, we received a Complete Response Letter (a CRL related to our Biologics License Application BLA for pz-cel for the treatment of patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa RDEB ).
In the CRL, the FDA noted that certain additional information needed to satisfy Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls CMC requirements must be satisfactorily resolved before the application can be approved. On August 8, 2024, we
completed a Type A Meeting with the FDA to discuss our forthcoming resubmission of our BLA and on October 28, 2024, we resubmitted
our BLA. The FDA notified the Company on November 8, 2024 that the BLA was accepted for review, with an assigned Prescription Drug
User Fee Act PDUFA target action date of April 29, 2025. A delay in receiving approval of the BLA could shorten any
periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our pz-cel or allow our competitors to bring products to
market before we do. This may impair our ability to successfully commercialize pz-cel. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be materially harmed. 

Other
than as set forth above, there have been no material changes in the assessment of our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
