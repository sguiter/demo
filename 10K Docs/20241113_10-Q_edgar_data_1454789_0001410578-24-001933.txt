 Astria Therapeutics, Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) million of shares of common stock under an at-the-market offering program (the 2024 ATM Program and collectively with the 2021 ATM Program, the ATM Programs ). The Company pays Jefferies commissions of up to of the gross proceeds from any common stock sold through the ATM Programs. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of shares of common stock under the 2024 ATM Program for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of shares of common stock under the ATM programs for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million. There was no activity in the ATM Programs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and had available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of million. The Company estimates its existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are sufficient to sustain operations for at least twelve months from the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has been primarily involved with research and development activities and has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as it continues to develop its product candidates. The Company has not generated any product revenues and has financed its operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of its equity securities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional equity, debt or other financing or generate product revenue or revenues from collaborative partners, on terms acceptable to the Company, on a timely basis or at all. The failure of the Company to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, successful discovery and development of its drug candidates, raising additional capital, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology and regulatory approval and market acceptance of the Company s products.

 shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share in its computation of weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by adjusting weighted average shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period, determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of the Company s dilutive net loss per share attributable to common stockholders calculation, stock options and warrants to purchase the Company s common stock were considered to be common stock equivalents but were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, as their effect would be anti-dilutive; therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders were the same for all periods presented. The following common stock equivalents, including Series X Preferred Stock shown as common stock equivalents, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect: Stock options Series X Preferred Stock t hold any restricted cash as of September 30, 2024. Restricted cash is presented as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets at September 30, 2023.

 Restricted cash Total million. Additionally, the Company incurred total issuance costs of million related to the private placement. Both of these features were recorded as a discount on Series X Preferred Stock recognized at the close of the transaction. These features are analogous to preferred dividends and are recorded as a non-cash return to holders of Series X Preferred Stock through additional paid-in capital. The discount related to the beneficial conversion feature was recognized through the earliest possible date of conversion, which occurred upon the stockholder approval of the conversion in June 2021. The issuance costs are recognized as a dividend at the time of conversion to common shares. As of September 30, 2024, million of the above amounts were accounted for as a non-cash dividend related to shares of Series X Preferred Stock, and million remained to be recognized upon future conversion. transfers between fair value measurement levels during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Gross Unrealized Gross Unrealized Amortized Cost Gains Losses Fair Value December 31, 2023 Reverse repurchase agreements Total The contractual maturities of all short-term investments held at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were one year or less. There were short-term investments in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is required to determine whether a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis of short-term investments is due to credit-related factors. At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation of impairment to determine if any unrealized losses are the result of credit losses. Impairment is assessed at the individual security level. Factors considered in determining whether a loss resulted from a credit loss or other factors include the Company s intent and ability to hold the investment until the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, any historical failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse legal or regulatory events affecting the issuer or issuer s industry, and any significant deterioration in economic conditions. Unrealized losses on short-term investments presented in the previous table have not been recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations because the securities are high credit quality, investment grade securities that the Company does not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is attributable to factors other than credit losses. Based on its evaluation, the Company determined it does t have any credit losses related to its short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Gross realized gains and losses on the sales of short-term investments are included in other income, net. Unrealized holding gains or losses for the period that have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income, as well as gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into other income, net, were not material to the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The cost of investments sold or the amount reclassified out of the accumulated other comprehensive income into other income, net is based on the specific identification method for purposes of recording realized gains and losses. All proceeds in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to maturities of underlying investments. The gains on proceeds from maturities of short-term investments were not material to the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the sections entitled Risk Factors and Summary of the Material Risks Associated with Our Business in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. This section provides additional information regarding our business, current developments, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, contractual commitments and critical accounting policies and estimates that require significant judgement and have the most potential impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. This discussion and analysis is intended to better allow investors to view our company from management s perspective. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for allergic and immunological diseases. Our focus is to develop first-choice therapies that improve the health and outcomes of patients with allergic and immunological diseases. Our lead product candidate is navenibart, formerly known as STAR-0215, a potential best-in-class monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein in clinical development for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, or HAE, a rare, debilitating and potentially life-threatening disease. Navenibart has the potential to be the most patient-friendly chronic treatment option for HAE, based on initial proof-of-concept data in HAE patients and the existing HAE treatment landscape. We believe that navenibart has the potential to become the market-leading HAE treatment if approved. Our second product candidate is STAR-0310, a monoclonal antibody OX40 antagonist that is in preclinical development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, or AD, an immune disorder associated with loss of skin barrier function and itching. We believe that with both of these programs, we are advancing a pipeline of products with meaningfully differentiated profiles based on validated mechanisms. Navenibart The treatment options for patients with HAE have improved in recent years, however, there is remaining unmet medical need and the global market for HAE therapy is strong and growing. The goal for navenibart is to develop a best-in-class monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein able to provide long-acting, effective attack prevention for HAE. Our vision for navenibart is to lead the HAE market and become the first-choice preventative treatment for HAE with administration every three and six months with the goal of normalizing the lives of people living with HAE. Targeted plasma kallikrein inhibition can prevent HAE attacks by suppressing the pathway that generates bradykinin and causes excessive swelling. Navenibart is currently in clinical development and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations to navenibart for the treatment of HAE. The European Commission has granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation to navenibart for the treatment of HAE. In February 2023, we advanced navenibart to a Phase 1b/2 trial called ALPHA-STAR, or Astria Long-acting Prophylaxis for Hereditary Angioedema: STAR-0215. This global, multi-center, open-label, single and multiple dose proof-of-concept clinical trial in people with HAE is evaluating safety, tolerability, HAE attack rate, pharmacokinetics, or PK, pharmacodynamics, or PD, and quality of life in patients three and six months after subcutaneous navenibart administration. We reported initial proof-of-concept data in HAE patients in March 2024, as described below. Target enrollment of 16 patients was achieved with all doses administered. The initial efficacy and safety data-cut was as of March 13, 2024. We expect to report final data from ALPHA - STAR target enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2024. Cohort 1 evaluated a 450 mg dose and all four patients had completed 6 months of follow-up. Efficacy observations compared to baseline through 6 months of follow-up were as follows: 92 reduction in monthly attack rate 96 reduction in moderate and severe attacks 91 reduction in acute rescue medication use 50 of patients were attack-free through 3 months of follow-up

 Cohort 2 evaluated a 600 mg dose followed by a 300 mg dose three months later, on Day 84. We plan to evaluate this dosing regimen in our planned Phase 3 trial. All six patients had completed 3 months of follow-up and three patients had completed 6 months of follow-up as of the data cut-off date. Efficacy observations compared to baseline through 6 months of follow-up were as follows: 96 reduction in monthly attack rate 98 reduction in moderate and severe attacks 94 reduction in acute rescue medication use 67 of patients were attack-free 100 of patients were attack-free in the first month after dosing, demonstrating rapid onset of action 
 Cohort 3 received a 600 mg dose followed by a 600 mg dose one month later, on Day 28. Four of six patients had completed 3 months of follow-up as of the data cut-off date. Efficacy observations compared to baseline through 3 months of follow-up were as follows: 90 reduction in monthly attack rate 100 reduction in moderate and severe attacks 95 reduction in acute rescue medication use 50 of patients were attack-free 
 Navenibart was generally well-tolerated with no serious treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, and no discontinuations. There were two treatment-related TEAEs (both mild), one of which was a case of dizziness and the other a transient injection site reaction (rash). There were no injection site reactions of pain. In October 2024, we presented new quality of life data from initial results from ALPHA-STAR at the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) demonstrating that navenibart induced rapid improvements in quality of life in HAE patients. By Day 28 after navenibart administration, 80 of participants achieved clinically meaningful improvements. Enrollment in ALPHA-STAR was expanded and a total of 29 patients were enrolled in the trial. The observed efficacy, PK, PD, and safety and tolerability profile of navenibart support advancement of navenibart into Phase 3 development. We are in discussions with global regulatory authorities and are finalizing the design for the Phase 3 pivotal trial. Pending regulatory feedback, we expect to start a Phase 3 pivotal trial in the first quarter of 2025 and expect top-line results by year-end 2026. Our goal for navenibart is to enable patients to choose what works best for them by developing both every 3-month, or Q3M, and every 6-month, or Q6M, administration options. We have initiated and are enrolling subjects in ALPHA-SOLAR, a long-term open-label trial assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of navenibart. All of the original 16 target enrollment patients from ALPHA-STAR have entered ALPHA-SOLAR. Participants are being assigned to receive navenibart in one of two dosing regimens: either 300mg Q3M or 600mg Q6M. We expect to report initial safety and efficacy data from ALPHA-SOLAR in mid-2025. STAR-0310 We believe that OX40 inhibition has the potential to treat AD and other diseases. The current treatment options in AD are insufficient to address the needs of many patients, and standard of care treatments include steroids and topical medications which can treat symptoms but do not address the underlying disease. Our goal for STAR-0310 is to reduce disease activity, relapse rate, and treatment burden for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. STAR-0310 was engineered with YTE half-life extension technology to enable infrequent dosing. As a potential long-acting OX40 inhibitor, STAR-0310 aims to address the need for a safe, effective, and infrequently administered AD treatment. In May 2024, we shared preclinical results for STAR-0310 at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) conference. STAR-0310 exhibited a long mean half-life of 26 days in cynomolgus monkeys compared to a half-life of 10-14 days for a typical non-half-life extended IgG antibody. There was also an approximately 8-fold increase in binding affinity to human OX40 observed for STAR-0310 compared to telazorlimab, an earlier generation antibody prior to affinity maturation without half-life extension. Preclinical results demonstrated significantly less antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, potential with STAR-

 0310 compared to rocatinlimab, an anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody in Phase 3 development by Amgen, Inc., with comparable potency. Having less ADCC in the context of robust potency could potentially result in a favorable safety profile and potentially wider therapeutic window for STAR-0310. We believe these preclinical results support the potential for STAR-0310 to have the best-in-class OX40 inhibitor profile. We are on track with the FDA investigational new drug application, or IND, for STAR-0310 for the treatment of AD by year-end. Assuming the IND clears, we anticipate initiating a Phase 1a clinical trial of STAR-0310 in healthy subjects in the first quarter of 2025 and reporting initial results from the Phase 1a clinical trial in the third quarter of 2025, including PK and PD data and early signals on safety and tolerability. Assuming positive results from the Phase 1a clinical trial, we plan to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial of STAR-0310 in patients with AD in the second half of 2025 and would expect to report results from such trial in the second quarter of 2026. The goals of the Phase 1b trial would be to demonstrate initial efficacy in AD as well as show differentiation in safety and tolerability and the potential for a reduced treatment burden as a result of extended half-life as compared to existing therapies. Underwritten Offerings On October 16, 2023, we closed an underwritten offering of (i) 8,253,895 shares of our common stock and accompanying common stock warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,190,418 shares of common stock and (ii), in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,571,093 shares of common stock and accompanying common stock warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,178,320 shares of common stock, which we refer to as the October 2023 Financing. The gross proceeds of the October 2023 Financing were 64.0 million and net proceeds were 59.5 million. On February 1, 2024, we closed an underwritten offering of 10,340,000 shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the February 2024 Financing. The gross proceeds of the February 2024 Financing were 125.0 million and net proceeds were 117.2 million. Financial Overview Our business is almost entirely dependent on the success of navenibart and STAR-0310. Navenibart is in clinical development and has only produced results in Phase 1a and Phase 1b/2 clinical testing and in preclinical and nonclinical settings. STAR-0310 is in the preclinical stage of development. Our net losses were 68.6 million and 41.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 649.2 million. We have not generated any product revenues and have financed our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities and have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical development programs. As of September 30, 2024, we had 344.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments which we expect will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2027, including all navenibart program activities through the completion of a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial as well as advancing our STAR-0310 OX40 program through submission of an IND and early proof-of-concept results from a Phase 1a clinical trial. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Advancing the development of navenibart, STAR-0310, or any future product candidates will require a significant amount of capital. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will not be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development of any of our product candidates, including navenibart, STAR-0310 or any future product candidate. We will need to obtain substantial additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of navenibart, STAR-0310 or any future product candidates and support our continuing operations, future clinical trials and expansion of our pipeline. Furthermore, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional financing to fund our long-term operations sooner than planned. See the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include: employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; 

 21 

Table of Contents 
 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct clinical trials and research and development and preclinical activities on our behalf; the cost of consultants; the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing study and clinical trial materials; and facilities and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies. 
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. We typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs. We record our research and development expenses net of any research and development tax incentives we are entitled to receive from government authorities. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Navenibart 23,868 18,278 STAR-0310 12,224 Other programs 655 2,836 Costs not directly allocated to programs: Employee expenses including cash compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation 12,996 7,920 Consultants and professional expenses, including stock-based compensation 5,964 957 Facilities 570 234 Other 668 235 Total costs not directly allocated to programs 20,198 9,346 Total research and development expenses 56,945 30,460 We expect to incur significant research and development expenses in the year ending December 31, 2024, and in future periods in connection with the clinical trials and other activities related to the development of navenibart and the preclinical studies, planned clinical trials and other activities related to the development of STAR-0310. Because of this, we expect that our research and development expenses over the next several quarters will be higher than the prior year periods. Development of navenibart, STAR-0310 and any future product candidates is highly uncertain and we cannot reasonably estimate at this time the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that would be necessary to complete the development of any such product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows would commence from navenibart, STAR-0310 or any other future product candidates. This is due to the fact that we would need to raise substantial additional capital to fund the completion of the clinical development of any such product candidates and the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing product candidates, including the uncertainties of: establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies; successful design of, enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials; feedback from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities on planned trial designs, preclinical studies and manufacturing capabilities and plans; changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes or perspectives that may delay or prevent the approval of new products; receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity; launching commercial sales, if we are able to obtain marketing approval, whether alone or in collaboration with others, and our ability to compete successfully with other products; and maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile following approval.

Table of Contents 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of navenibart, STAR-0310 or any future product candidate, would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, information technology, new product planning, business development, legal and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase from their current levels as we continue to grow our company, develop navenibart and STAR-0310, and potentially expand our pipeline to include other product candidates. Other Income, Net Other income, net consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and net amortization expense on short-term investments, and gains and losses related to foreign currency fluctuations. Critical Accounting Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies as reported in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, together with the dollar change in those items (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, Period-to- 2024 2023 Period Change Operating expenses: Research and development 20,510 13,338 7,172 General and administrative 8,504 6,898 1,606 Total operating expenses 29,014 20,236 8,778 Loss from operations (29,014) (20,236) (8,778) Other income, net 4,480 2,509 1,971 Net loss (24,534) (17,727) (6,807) Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased by 7.2 million to 20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 54 . The increase in research and development expenses was primarily associated with the STAR-0310 program s manufacturing and IND-enabling activities in addition to an increase

 in external expenses to support a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial for navenibart. These research and development activities resulted in a 3.5 million increase in expenses related to external research, manufacturing, and IND-enabling activities related to the STAR-0310 program, a 2.4 million increase in consulting expenses primarily to support the planned Phase 3 pivotal trial for navenibart, a 1.9 million increase in employee expenses due to a 0.7 million increase in employee stock-based compensation expenses and additional costs related to company growth, and a 0.3 million increase in facilities and other costs, partially offset by a 0.6 million decrease in expenses attributable to other research programs and a 0.3 million decrease in external research and development costs associated with the navenibart program. We expect that our research and development expenses over the next several quarters will be higher than prior periods. We anticipate initiating a Phase 3 pivotal trial for navenibart in the first quarter of 2025 in addition to initiating a Phase 1a clinical trial of STAR-0310 in the first quarter of 2025. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased by 1.6 million to 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 23 . The increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to a 1.5 million increase in employee expenses primarily due to a 0.9 million increase in employee stock-based compensation expenses and additional costs related to company growth, a 0.1 million increase in facilities costs and a 0.1 million increase in general office expenses, partially offset by a 0.1 million decrease in other costs such as insurance and professional service expenses. Other Income, Net Other income, net increased by 2.0 million to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 79 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest and investment income due to an increase in interest-earning assets from the proceeds of financing activities. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, together with the dollar change in those items (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Period-to- 2024 2023 Period Change Operating expenses: Research and development 56,945 30,460 26,485 General and administrative 25,022 18,371 6,651 Total operating expenses 81,967 48,831 33,136 Loss from operations (81,967) (48,831) (33,136) Other income, net 13,333 7,350 5,983 Net loss (68,634) (41,481) (27,153) Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased by 26.5 million to 57.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 30.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 87 . The increase in research and development expenses was associated with the STAR-0310 program s manufacturing and IND-enabling activities in addition to external research and development costs associated with the navenibart program s advancement in our multi-site international clinical trials and start-up activities to support a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial. These research and development activities resulted in a 12.2 million increase in expenses related to external research, manufacturing, and IND-enabling activities related to the STAR-0310 program, a 5.6 million increase in CRO and manufacturing expenses to support the ALPHA-STAR and ALPHA-SOLAR clinical trials in addition to start-up activities to support a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial for navenibart, a 5.1 million increase in employee expenses due to a 1.8 million increase in employee stock-based compensation expenses and additional costs related to company growth, a 5.0 million increase in consulting expenses, and a 0.8 million increase in facilities and other costs, partially offset by a 2.2 million decrease in expenses attributable to other research programs.

 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased by 6.6 million to 25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 36 . The increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to a 5.2 million increase in employee expenses primarily due to a 3.1 million increase in employee stock-based compensation expenses and additional costs related to company growth, a 1.0 million increase in professional services due to increased legal fees and consulting expenses, and a 0.4 million increase in other costs, including general office, facilities, and insurance expenses. Other Income, Net Other income, net increased by 6.0 million to 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest and investment income due to an increase in interest-earning assets from the proceeds of financing activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources From our inception through September 30, 2024, we raised an aggregate of 839.2 million through equity financings including private placements of preferred stock before we became a public company, our private placement of preferred stock in February 2021 and registered offerings of our common stock, including our at-the-market offering programs. As of September 30, 2024, we had 344.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments which we expect will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2027, including all navenibart program activities through the completion of a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial, as well as advancing our STAR-0310 OX40 program through submission of an IND and early proof-of-concept results from a Phase 1a trial. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Furthermore, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional financing to fund our long-term operations sooner than planned. Advancing the development of navenibart, STAR-0310, or any future product candidates will require a significant amount of capital and our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will not be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development of any of our product candidates, including navenibart, STAR-0310 or any future product candidate. In addition, navenibart, STAR-0310, or any future product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of product candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available for years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of navenibart, STAR-0310 or any future product candidates, support our continuing operations, future clinical trials and the expansion of our pipeline. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. General economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States, including heightened inflation, capital market instability and volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations and economic slowdown or recession as well as pandemics, epidemics and geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the Ukraine-Russian war and the conflict in the Middle East), may have a significant impact on the availability of funding sources and the terms on which any funding may be available. In addition, market instability and volatility, high levels of inflation and interest rate fluctuations may increase our cost of financing or restrict our access to potential sources of future liquidity. If we fail to raise capital as, and when, needed, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to modify our business strategies and reduce or terminate our operations. Although we will continue to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations when needed or at all. October 2023 Financing On October 16, 2023, we closed the October 2023 Financing, in which we sold (i) 8,253,895 shares of our common stock and accompanying common stock warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,190,418 shares of common stock and (ii), in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,571,093 shares of common stock and accompanying common stock warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,178,320 shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of 64.0 million and net proceeds of 59.5 million.

 February 2024 Financing On February 1, 2024, we closed the February 2024 Financing, in which we sold 10,340,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of 125.0 million and net proceeds of 117.2 million. At-the-Market Offerings In June 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, pursuant to which we could issue and sell shares of common stock under an at-the-market offering program, or the 2021 ATM Program, which was completed in the first quarter of 2024. On March 4, 2024, we entered into a new Open Market Sale Agreement SM with Jefferies, pursuant to which we are able to issue and sell up to 150.0 million of shares of common stock under an at-the-market offering program, or the 2024 ATM Program, and collectively with the 2021 ATM Program, the ATM Programs. We pay Jefferies commissions of up to 3 of the gross proceeds from any common stock sold through the ATM Programs. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 1,504,619 shares of common stock under the 2024 ATM Program for gross proceeds of 15.6 million and net proceeds of 15.2 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 4,450,425 shares of common stock under the ATM programs for gross proceeds of 36.2 million and net proceeds of 35.2 million. There was no activity in the ATM Programs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Flows Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (63,850) (38,207) Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (188,146) 137,068 Net cash provided by financing activities 157,202 420 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (94,794) 99,281 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 63.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of a net loss of 68.6 million adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of 9.6 million, partially offset by accretion of the discount/premium on investment securities of 4.2 million, a decrease to our right of use asset of 0.7 million, and a decrease in net assets of 1.4 million, which resulted primarily from an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 4.1 million, a decrease in the lease liability of 0.4 million and a decrease in accounts payable of 0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses of 3.3 million. Net cash used in operating activities was 38.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted primarily of a net loss of 41.5 million adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of 4.2 million, a decrease to our right of use asset of 0.4 million, and offset by a net decrease in net assets of 1.3 million, which resulted primarily from an increase in prepaid expenses of 1.3 million. Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was 188.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of purchases of short-term investments of 3.5 billion, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments of 3.3 billion as the proceeds from maturities of short-term investments, primarily repurchase agreements with maturities due within five days or less, were purchased and reinvested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by investing activities was 137.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted primarily of maturities of short-term investments of 1.4 billion, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of 1.2 billion.

 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 157.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was attributable to net proceeds of 117.2 million from the February 2024 Financing, net proceeds of 35.2 million from the ATM Programs and proceeds from exercises of stock options and warrants of 4.8 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was attributable to proceeds from exercises of stock options of 0.4 million. Funding Requirements Our primary uses of capital are for compensation and related expenses, manufacturing costs for preclinical and clinical materials, third party preclinical and clinical research and development services, clinical costs, legal and other regulatory expenses, and general overhead. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 649.2 million. We have been primarily involved with research and development activities and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2027, including all navenibart program activities through the completion of a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial, as well as advancing our STAR-0310 OX40 program through submission of an IND and early proof-of-concept results from a Phase 1a trial. Our estimate as to how long we expect our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to be able to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of biotechnology products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Further, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: the progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of, and research and preclinical development efforts for navenibart, STAR-0310 and any future product candidates, including potential future clinical trials; our ability to enter into and the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish; the number and characteristics of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements; the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, market access, distribution, supply chain and manufacturing capabilities, and scaling up the manufacturing of drug substance and drug product to clinical and commercial scale and developing a drug device combination, if applicable, securing all raw materials necessary to conduct such scale-up and successfully completing all other activities related thereto; if we obtain marketing approval of any of our product candidates, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates; if we obtain marketing approval of any of our product candidates, our ability to successfully compete against other approved products that are approved or used as treatments for the indications for which our products are approved, including with respect to navenibart in HAE and STAR-0310 in AD; our headcount growth and associated costs; the amount and timing of future milestone and royalty payments potentially payable to Ichnos Sciences SA and Ichnos Sciences Inc., or collectively Ichnos, pursuant to our October 2023 license agreement covering STAR-0310; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and the costs of operating as a public company. 
 Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, navenibart, STAR-0310 or any future product candidates, if approved, may not achieve

 commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of medicines that we do not expect to be commercially available for years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. Debt financing, if available, would result in periodic payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual Obligations Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of September 30, 2024 are primarily related to our sublease agreements for office space. For information related to our future commitments relating to our sublease agreement, see Note 6, Commitments , of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials, with third party manufacturers for clinical supplies and with vendors for preclinical research studies and other services and products for operating purposes. The contracts are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 to 90 days prior written notice to the counterparty, and we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. Our license agreement with Ichnos which covers STAR-0310 includes potential milestone payments, tiered royalties and other obligations that are dependent upon the development of products using the intellectual property licensed under the agreement and contingent upon the achievement of development or regulatory approval milestones, as well as commercial milestones. These potential obligations are contingent upon future events and the timing and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known with certainty. For further information regarding this agreement, please see Note 1, Organization and Operations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
