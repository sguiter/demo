The
corporate bonds are investments in subordinated debt of two federally-insured banks, the majority of which is callable after five
years of origination. The Company reviewed the financial strength of these bonds and concluded that the amortized cost remains
supported by the expected future cash flows and there were no credit impairments on the bonds at September 30, 2024. All securities
are performing at September 30, 2024. 

At
September 30, 2024, U.S. Treasury securities with a fair value of million, government-sponsored enterprise obligations with
a fair value of million and mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of million were pledged to secure public
deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. The securities collateralizing public deposits are subject to
fluctuations in fair value. We monitor the fair value of the collateral on a periodic basis, and pledge additional collateral
if necessary based on changes in fair value of collateral or the balances of such deposits.

Allowance
for Credit Losses Securities Available-for-Sale 

The
Company measures expected credit losses on debt securities available-for-sale based upon the gain or loss position of the security.
For debt securities available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position which the Company does not intend to sell, and it is not
more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the Company s amortized cost,
the Company evaluates qualitative criteria to determine any expected loss. This includes among other items the financial health
of, and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security.
The Company also evaluates quantitative criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future
cash flows of the security. Securities available-for-sale which are guaranteed by government agencies do not currently have an
allowance for credit loss as the Company determined these securities are either backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government and/or there is an unconditional commitment to make interest payments and to return the principal investment in full
to investors when a debt security reaches maturity. In assessing the Company s investments in government-sponsored and U.S. government
guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and government-sponsored enterprise obligations, the contractual cash flows of these investments
are guaranteed by the respective government-sponsored enterprise; Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC ),
Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA ), Federal Farm Credit Bank FFCB ), or Federal Home Loan
Bank FHLB ). Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the par value
of the Company s investments. The Company will evaluate this position no less than annually, however, certain items which may
cause the Company to change this methodology include legislative changes that remove a government-sponsored enterprise s
ability to draw funds from the U.S. government, or legislative changes to housing policy that reduce or eliminate the U.S. government s
implicit guarantee on such securities. Accrued interest receivable on securities available-for-sale guaranteed by government agencies
totaled at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.
If the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, an allowance for credit losses would
be recorded, with a related charge to earnings. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that
the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes the
entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value in earnings. Any impairment that has not
been recorded through an allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Accrued interest receivable on
debt securities available-for-sale not guaranteed by government agencies totaled at September 30, 2024 and at
December 31, 2023, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. There were no allowances for credit losses established
on debt securities available-for-sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

At
September 30, 2024, there was one available-for-sale corporate bond that was rated below investment grade by one or more ratings
agencies, while at December 31, 2023, there were two available-for-sale corporate bonds that were rated below investment grade
by one or more ratings agencies. At September 30, 2024, the Company reviewed the financial strength of the one available-for-sale
corporate bond below investment grade and concluded that the amortized cost remains supported by the expected future cash flows
of the security. 

Allowance
for Credit Losses Securities Held-to-Maturity 

The
Company measures expected credit losses on debt securities held-to-maturity on a collective basis by security type and risk rating
where available. The reserve for each pool is calculated based on a Probability of Default/Loss Given Default basis taking into
consideration the expected life of each security. Held-to-maturity securities which are issued by the United States Treasury or
are guaranteed by government agencies do not currently have an allowance for credit loss as the Company determined these securities
are either backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and/or there is an unconditional commitment to make interest
payments and to return the principal investment in full to investors when a debt security reaches maturity. In assessing the Company s
investments in government-sponsored and U.S. government guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and government-sponsored enterprise
obligations, the contractual cash flows of these investments are guaranteed by the respective government-sponsored enterprise;
FHLMC, FNMA, FFCB, or FHLB. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the par
value of the Company s investments. The Company will evaluate this position no less than annually, however, certain items which
may cause the Company to change this methodology include legislative changes that remove a government-sponsored enterprise s
ability to draw funds from the U.S. government, or legislative changes to housing policy that reduce or eliminate the U.S. government s
implicit guarantee on such securities. Any expected credit losses on securities held-to-maturity would be presented as an allowance
for credit loss. Accrued interest receivable on securities held-to-maturity totaled at September 30, 2024 and 
at December 31, 2023, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. There were no allowances for credit losses established
on securities held-to-maturity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management attributed the unrealized losses to increases in current market yields compared
to the yields at the time the investments were purchased by the Company and not due to credit quality.

The
Company expects to recover its amortized cost basis on all securities in its available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios.
Furthermore, the Company does not intend to sell, nor does it anticipate that it will be required to sell any of its securities
in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, prior to this anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value on its
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions and
not due to credit quality issues. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities and the
fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity. The Company s ability and intent to hold these securities
until recovery is supported by the Company s strong capital and liquidity positions as well as its historically low portfolio
turnover. 

The
following description provides the number of investment positions in an unrealized loss position: 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized losses on the securities available-for-sale portfolio of million, or
 of the amortized cost basis of the securities available-for-sale, compared to unrealized losses of million, or 
of the amortized cost basis of the securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there were securities
available-for-sale in which the fair value was less than the amortized cost, compared to securities available-for-sale at December
31, 2023. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized losses on the securities held-to-maturity portfolio of million, or ,
of the amortized cost basis of the securities held-to-maturity portfolio, compared to million, or of the amortized
cost basis of the securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there securities held-to-maturity
in which the fair value was less than the amortized cost, compared to securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2023.

Loans
Pledged as Collateral. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of eligible loans pledged as collateral to support borrowing capacity
at the FHLB were million and million, respectively. The outstanding balance of FHLB advances was 128.3 million
and 40.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

At
September 30, 2024, the carrying value of eligible loans pledged as collateral to support borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve
Bank FRB was million. There were no loans pledged to secure borrowing capacity at the FRB at December 31,
2023. There were no funds borrowed from the FRB backed by loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Loans
Serviced for Others. 

The
Company has transferred a portion of its originated commercial loans to participating lenders. The amounts transferred have been
accounted for as sales and are therefore not included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We continue to service
the loans on behalf of the participating lenders. We share with participating lenders, on a pro-rata basis, any gains or losses
that may result from a borrower s lack of compliance with contractual terms of the loan. At September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the Company was servicing commercial loans participated out to various other institutions totaling million and
 million, respectively. 

Residential
real estate mortgages are originated by the Company both for its portfolio and for sale into the secondary market. The Company
may sell its loans to institutional investors such as the FHLMC. Under loan sale and servicing agreements with the investor, the
Company generally continues to service the residential real estate mortgages. The Company pays the investor an agreed upon rate
on the loan, which is less than the interest rate received from the borrower. The Company retains the difference as a fee for
servicing the residential real estate mortgages. The Company capitalizes mortgage servicing rights at their fair value upon sale
of the related loans, amortizes the asset over the estimated life of the serviced loan, and periodically assesses the asset for
impairment. The significant assumptions used by a third party to estimate the fair value of capitalized servicing rights at September
30, 2024, include weighted average prepayment speed for the portfolio using the Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment
Model PSA), average internal rate of return ), weighted average servicing fee ), and average cost to service
loans per loan). The estimated fair value of capitalized servicing rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods
primarily due to changing market interest rates, and their effect on prepayment speeds and discount rates. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold million in residential real estate mortgages with servicing retained and recorded
gains on the sale of mortgages of within non-interest income. There were no sales of residential real estate mortgages
to the secondary market during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was servicing residential mortgage loans owned by investors totaling 
million and million, respectively. Servicing fee income of and was recorded for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in service charges and fees on the consolidated statements of net income.

Loans
are recorded at the principal amount outstanding, adjusted for charge-offs, unearned premiums and deferred loan fees and costs.
Interest on loans is calculated using the effective yield method on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding and is
credited to income on the accrual basis to the extent it is deemed collectable. Our general policy is to discontinue the accrual
of interest when principal or interest payments are delinquent 90 days or more based on the contractual terms of the loan, or
earlier if there are concerns regarding the collectability of the loan. Any unpaid amounts previously accrued on these loans are
reversed from income. Subsequent cash receipts are applied to the outstanding principal balance or to interest income if, in the
judgment of management, collection of the principal balance is not in question. Loans are returned to accrual status when they
become current as to both principal and interest and perform in accordance with contractual terms for a period of at least six
months, reducing the concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination
costs are deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the estimated average lives
of the related loans. 

Allowance
for Credit Losses. 

The
allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company s existing loans held for investment
portfolio. The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment, as reported in our consolidated balance sheet, is adjusted
by a credit loss expense, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Accrued
interest receivable on loans held for investment was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023
and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

The
loan loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of loan portfolio segments,
which consist of commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans.
These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes, the level at which credit risk is monitored. For each of these pools,
the Company generates cash flow projections at the instrument level wherein payment expectations are adjusted for estimated prepayment
speed, curtailments, time to recovery, probability of default, and loss given default. The modeling of expected prepayment speeds,
curtailment rates, and time to recovery are based on historical internal data. The quantitative component of the ACL on loans
is model-based and utilizes a forward-looking macroeconomic forecast. The Company uses a discounted cash flow method, incorporating
probability of default and loss given default forecasted based on statistically derived economic variable loss drivers, to estimate
expected credit losses. This process includes estimates which involve modeling loss projections attributable to existing loan
balances, and considering historical experience, current conditions, and future expectations for pools of loans over a reasonable
and supportable forecast period. The historical information either experienced by the Company or by a selection of peer banks,
when appropriate, is derived from a combination of recessionary and non-recessionary performance periods for which data is available. 

Commercial
real estate loans . Loans in this segment include owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multi-family
dwellings, and income producing investment properties, as well as commercial construction loans for commercial development projects
throughout New England. Typically, commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, apartment buildings, industrial
properties, warehouses, retail facilities, hotels, assisted living facilities, and educational facilities. Collateral values are
established by independent third-party appraisals and evaluations. Primary repayment sources for commercial real estate loans
include operating income and cash flow generated by the real estate, sale of the real estate and, funds from any liquidation of
the collateral. Under its lending guidelines, the Company generally requires a corporate or personal guarantee from individuals
that hold material ownership in the borrowing entity. The underlying cash flows generated by the properties or operations can
be adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy due to increased vacancy rates or diminished cash flows, which in turn, would
have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. Management obtains financial information annually and continually monitors
the cash flows of these loans. 

Residential
real estate loans . This portfolio segment consists of first mortgages secured by one-to-four family residential properties
and home equity loans and home equity lines secured by first or second mortgage on one-to-four family owner-occupied properties.
First mortgages may be underwritten to a maximum loan-to-value of for owner-occupied homes, for second homes and for
investment properties. Mortgages with loan-to-values greater than require private mortgage insurance. We do not grant subprime
loans. Home equity loans and lines are underwritten to a maximum combined loan-to-value of of the appraised value of the property.
Underwriting approval is dependent on review of the borrower s ability to repay principal and interest on a monthly basis,
credit history, financial resources and the value of the collateral. Residential real estate loans are originated either for sale
to investors or retained in the Company s loan portfolio. Decisions about whether to sell or retain residential real estate
loans are made based on the interest rate, pricing for loans in the secondary market, and the Company s liquidity and capital
needs. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing pricing, will have an effect on the credit
quality in this segment. 

Commercial
and industrial loans . The primary risk associated with commercial and industrial loans is the ability of borrowers to achieve
business results and cash flows consistent with those projected at loan origination. Collateral frequently consists of a first
lien position on business assets including, but not limited to, accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment. The primary repayment
source is operating cash flow, followed by liquidation of assets. Under its lending guidelines, the Company generally requires
a corporate or personal guarantee from individuals that hold material ownership in the borrowing entity. A weakened economy and
resultant decreased consumer spending will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. 

Consumer
loans . Loans in this segment are both secured and unsecured and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual
borrower. 

Allowance
for Credit Losses Methodology 

In
estimating the component of the allowance for credit losses for loans that share similar risk characteristics with other loans,
such loans are segregated into loan classes. Loans are designated into loan classes based on loans pooled by product types and
similar risk characteristics or areas of risk concentration. In determining the allowance for credit losses, we derive an estimated
credit loss assumption from a model that categorizes loan pools based on loan type and purpose. This discounted cash flow DCF model calculates an expected loss percentage for each loan class by considering the probability of default, using life-of-loan
analysis periods for the commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, residential real estate loan segments, and the historical
severity of loss, based on the aggregate net lifetime losses incurred per loan class. The expected loss estimates for the consumer
loan are based on historical loss rates using the remaining life method. The default and severity factors used to calculate the
allowance for credit losses for loans that share similar risk characteristics with other loans are adjusted for differences between
the historical period used to calculate historical default and loss severity rates and expected conditions over the remaining
lives of the loans in the portfolio related to: (1) lending policies and procedures; (2) international, national, regional and
local economic business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio; (3) the nature and volume
of the loan portfolio including the terms of the loans; (4) the experience, ability, and depth of the lending management and other
relevant staff; (5) the volume and severity of past due and adversely classified loans and the volume of nonaccrual loans; (6)
the quality of our loan review system and (7) the value of underlying collateral for collateralized loans. Additional factors
include the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations and the effect
of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing
portfolio. Such factors are used to adjust the historical probabilities of default and severity of loss so that they reflect management
expectation of future conditions based on a reasonable and supportable forecast. The Company uses regression analysis of historical
internal and peer data to determine which variables are best suited to be economic variables utilized when modeling lifetime probability
of default and loss given default. This analysis also determines how expected probability of default and loss given default will
react to forecasted levels of the economic variables. 

For
all DCF models, management has determined that four quarters represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts
back to a historical loss rate over four quarters on a straight-line basis. Other internal and external indicators of economic
forecasts are also considered by management when developing the forecast metrics. 

Individually
evaluated financial assets 

For
a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans, expected credit loss is measured based on net realizable value,
that is, the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, based on the original effective interest
rate, and the amortized cost basis of the loan. For these loans, we recognize expected credit loss equal to the amount by which
the net realizable value of the loan is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan (which is net of previous charge-offs and
deferred loan fees and costs), except when the loan is collateral dependent, that is, when the borrower is experiencing financial
difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In these cases,
expected credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair value of the collateral.
The fair value of the collateral is adjusted for the estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of a loan is dependent
on the sale (rather than only on the operation) of the collateral. 

Allowance
for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments 

The
Company maintains a separate allowance for credit losses from off-balance-sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments,
which is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. Management estimates the amount of expected losses by calculating
a commitment usage factor over the contractual period for exposures that are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company and
applying the loss factors used in the ACL methodology to the results of the usage calculation to estimate the liability for credit
losses related to unfunded commitments for each loan type. No credit loss estimate is reported for outstanding off-balance-sheet
credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit
exposures is adjusted as credit loss expense. Categories of off-balance sheet credit exposures correspond to the loan portfolio
segments described above. Management evaluates the need for a reserve on unfunded loan commitments in a manner consistent with
loans held for investment.

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of , compared to a
reversal for credit losses of 294,000 during
the three months ended June 30, 2024. The provision for credit losses includes a provision for credit losses on loans of 
and a reserve on unfunded loan commitments of .
The increase in the provision for credit losses on loans was due to changes in the economic environment and related adjustments to
the quantitative components of the CECL methodology as well as growth in the loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses was
determined by a number of factors: the continued strong credit performance of the Company s loan portfolio, changes in the
loan portfolio mix and Management s consideration of existing economic conditions and the economic outlook from the Federal
Reserve s actions to control inflation. The increase in reserves on unfunded loan commitments was due to an increase in
commercial real estate unfunded loan commitments of million,
or ,
from million
at June 30, 2024 to million
at September 30, 2024. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and
the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes it is appropriately reserved for the current economic environment. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of , comprised of a 
provision for loan losses, partially offset by a 55,000 reversal of credit losses for unfunded commitments. The provision expense
during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to changes in the economic environment and related adjustments
to the quantitative components of the CECL methodology. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of , compared to a provision
for credit losses of during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised of a 271,000 reversal of credit losses, which was offset by a 
reserve on unfunded loan commitments related to the impact of higher unfunded loan commitments for the period. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of , comprised of a 
provision for loan losses, partially offset by a 382,000 reversal of reserves on unfunded loan commitments primarily related
to the impact of lower unfunded loan commitments. 

The
provision for or reversal of credit losses was determined by a number of factors: the continued strong credit performance of the
Company s loan portfolio, changes in the loan portfolio mix and management s consideration of existing economic conditions
and the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve s actions to control inflation. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic
variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes it is appropriately
reserved for the current economic environment and supportable forecast period.

of interest on loans is generally discontinued when contractual payment of principal or interest becomes past due 90 days or,
if in management's judgment, reasonable doubt exists as to the full timely collection of interest. Exceptions may be made if the
loan has matured and is in the process of renewal or is well-secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on
nonaccrual status, interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current interest income.
Interest payments on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal. If collection of the principal is reasonably assured,
interest payments are recognized as income on the cash basis. Loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and
interest payments are current, full collectability of principal and interest is reasonably assured and a consistent record of
at least six consecutive months of performance has been achieved.

Individually
Evaluated Collateral Dependent Loans. 

Loans
that do not share similar risk characteristics with loans that are pooled into portfolio segments are individually evaluated.
A loan is considered collateral dependent when, based on current information and events, the borrower is experiencing financial
difficulty and repayment, both principal and interest, is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale
of the collateral. Loans that are rated Substandard, have a loan-to-value above 85 or have demonstrated a specific weakness (e.g.,
slow payment history, industry weakness, or other clear credit deterioration) may be considered for individual evaluation if they
are determined not to share similar risk characteristics within the segment. Individually evaluated assets will be measured primarily
using the collateral dependent financial asset practical expedient, although the discounted cash flow method may be used when
management deems it more appropriate or collateral values cannot be supported. For individually evaluated assets, an ACL is determined
separately for each financial asset. At September 30, 2024, the Company had in individually evaluated commercial loans,
collateralized by business assets, and million in individually evaluated real estate loans, collateralized by real estate
property.

Modified
Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty. 

The
Company will modify the contractual terms of loans to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties as a way to mitigate loss
and comply with regulations regarding bankruptcy and discharge situations. Loans are designated as modified when, as part of an
agreement to modify the original contractual terms of the loan as a result of financial difficulties of the borrower, the Company
grants the borrower a concession on the terms that would not otherwise be considered. Typically, such concessions may consist
of a reduction in interest rate to a below market rate, taking into account the credit quality of the note, extension of additional
credit based on receipt of adequate collateral, or a deferment or reduction of payments (principal or interest) which materially
alters the Company's position or significantly extends the note's maturity date, such that the present value of cash flows to
be received is materially less than those contractually established at the loan's origination. 

There
were no loan modifications granted based on borrower financial difficulty during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no modified loans defaulted (defined
as 30 days or more past due) within 12 months of restructuring. There were no charge-offs on modified loans during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

Credit
Quality Information. 

The
Company monitors the credit quality of its loan portfolio by using internal risk ratings that are based on regulatory guidance.
The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their
debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current
economic trends, among other factors. The Company utilizes an eight-grade internal loan rating system for commercial real estate
and commercial and industrial loans. 

The
grades assigned and definitions are as follows: loans graded excellent, above average, good are classified as Pass 
for grading purposes (risk ratings 1-4). All loans risk rated Special Mention (5), Substandard (6), Doubtful (7) and Loss (8)
are listed on the Company s criticized report and are reviewed not less than on a quarterly basis to assess the level of
risk and to ensure that appropriate actions are being taken to minimize potential loss exposure. In addition, the Company closely
monitors classified loans, defined as Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss for signs of deterioration to mitigate the growth in nonaccrual
loans, including performing additional due diligence, updating valuations and requiring additional financial reporting from the
borrower. Loans identified as containing a loss are partially charged-off or fully charged-off. Performing residential real estate,
home equity and consumer loans are grouped with Pass rated loans. Nonperforming residential real estate, home equity
and consumer loans are risk rated as Substandard and individually evaluated. 

Loans
rated 1 4 : Loans rated 1-4 are classified as Pass and have quality metrics to support that the loan
will be repaid according to the terms established and are not subject to adverse criticism as defined in regulatory guidance.
Pass loans exhibit characteristics that represent acceptable risk and are not considered problem loans. 

Loans
rated 5 : Loans rated 5 are classified as Special Mention and have potential weaknesses that deserve management s
close attention. Special mention loans are currently performing but with potential weaknesses including adverse trends in borrower s
operations, credit quality, financial strength, or possible collateral deficiency. Loans in this category are currently protected
based on collateral and repayment capacity and do not constitute undesirable credit risk, but have potential weakness that may
result in deterioration of the repayment process at some future date. Special Mention loans do not sufficiently expose the Company
to warrant adverse classification. 

Loans
rated 6 : Loans rated 6 are classified as Substandard and have an identified definitive weakness which may make
full collection of contractual cash flows questionable and/or jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. 

Loans
rated 7 : Loans rated 7 are classified as Doubtful and have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard
with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation of the loan highly questionable and improbable.
The possibility of some loss is extremely high, but because of specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening
of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. 

Loans
rated 8 : Loans rated 8 are classified a Loss and are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance
for credit losses. The loss classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather
that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off the asset because recovery and collection time may be affected in the
future. 

On
an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company formally reviews the ratings on all commercial real estate loans over 
million and commercial and industrial loans over million. On an ongoing basis, Management utilizes delinquency reports, interim
customer financials, the criticized loan report and other loan reports to monitor credit quality and adjust risk ratings accordingly.
In addition, at least on an annual basis, the Company contracts with an independent third-party to review the internal credit
ratings assigned to loans in the commercial loan portfolio on a pre-determined schedule, based on the type, size, rating, and
overall risk of the loan. During the course of its review, the third party examines a sample of loans, including new loans, existing
relationships over certain dollar amounts and classified assets.

shares of the Company s common stock were reserved for
grants of stock awards, including stock options and restricted stock, which may be granted to any officer, key employee or non-employee
director of the Company. Any shares that are not issued because vesting requirements are not met will be available for future
issuance under the 2021 Omnibus Plan. 

On
an annual basis, the Compensation Committee (the Committee approves long-term incentive awards out of the 2021
Omnibus Plan, whereby shares will be granted to eligible participants of the Company that are nominated by the Chief Executive
Officer and approved by the Committee, with vesting over a three-year term for employees and a one-year term for directors. Annual
employee grants provide for a periodic award that is both performance and time-based and is designed to recognize the executive s
responsibilities, reward performance and leadership and as a retention tool. The objective of the award is to align compensation
for the named executive officers and directors over a multi-year period directly with the interests of our shareholders by motivating
and rewarding creation and preservation of long-term financial strength, shareholder value and relative shareholder return. 

2021
Long-Term Incentive Plan 

In

over a three-year period. The remaining shares, or of the shares granted, were performance-based restricted shares
which were subject to the achievement of the 2021 LTI Plan performance metrics. 

The
Committee selected Return on Average Equity ROE and Three-Year Cumulative Diluted Earnings per Share EPS as the primary performance metrics for the 2021 LTI Plan. Each of these two measures were independently assigned a weight
for determining future performance against goals. Performance-based restricted shares will be earned based upon the Company s
performance relative to Threshold, Target and Stretch absolute goals on an annual performance period for ROE metrics and for a
 three-year cumulative performance period for EPS. For each performance-based goal, achieving Threshold performance pays at 
of Target value, while achieving Stretch performance pays at of Target value. The performance-based shares will be certified
by the Committee and distributed at the end of the three-year period as earned.

the Federal Reserve s capital adequacy regulations. 

The
Notes are presented net of issuance costs of as of September 30, 2024, which are being amortized into interest expense
over the life of the Notes. Amortization of issuance costs into interest expense was for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Fair
Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk. 

The
Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain pools of fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates.
The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes
in the designated benchmark interest rate. The Company's interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment
of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements
without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the
gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
in interest income . 

Total 

These
amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios of fixed rate residential loans used to designate hedging relationships
in which the hedged item is the stated amount of assets in the closed portfolio anticipated to be outstanding for the designated
hedged period. At September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was
 million; the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships was approximately ; and the
notional amount of the designated hedged items were million. At December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of the closed
portfolios used in these hedging relationships was million; the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging
relationships was approximately ; and the notional amount of the designated hedged items were million. The notional
amounts of these agreements do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the potential loss
exposure. At September 30, 2024, the Company s fair value hedges had a remaining maturity of years, and an average fixed
rate of . 

Non-hedging
Derivatives. 

Derivatives
not designated as hedges are not speculative, but rather result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The
Company executes loan-level derivative products such as interest-rate swap agreements with commercial banking customers to aid
them in managing their interest-rate risk by converting floating-rate loan payments to fixed-rate loan payments. The Company concurrently
enters into offsetting swaps with a third-party financial institution, effectively minimizing the Company s net risk exposure
resulting from such transactions. The third-party financial institution exchanges the customer's fixed-rate loan payments for
floating-rate loan payments. As the interest-rate swap agreements associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements,
changes in the fair value are recognized directly in earnings.

Credit-risk-related
Contingent Features 

By
using derivative financial instruments, we expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of failure by the counterparty
to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty
owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore,
it does not possess credit risk. The credit risk in derivative instruments is mitigated by entering into transactions with highly-rated
counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy and by limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty. 

We
have agreements with our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if we default on any of our indebtedness, including default
where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then we could also be declared in default
on our derivative obligations. We also have agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision
where if we fail to maintain our status as well capitalized, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and
we would be required to settle our obligations under the agreements. Certain of our agreements with our derivative counterparties
contain provisions where if a formal administrative action by a federal or state regulatory agency occurs that materially changes
our creditworthiness in an adverse manner, we may be required to fully collateralize our obligations under the derivative instrument. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of our derivative counterparties. As of September
30, 2024, we were not required to post collateral under these agreements because we did not have any derivatives in a liability
position with those counterparties.

 Collateral dependent loans 

The amount of impaired loans represents
the carrying value, net of the related write-down or valuation allowance of collateral dependent loans for which adjustments are
based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. The fair value of collateral dependent loans with specific
allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on real estate appraisals performed by independent licensed or
certified appraisers. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including
comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers
to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Management will discount appraisals
as deemed necessary based on the date of the appraisal and new information deemed relevant to the valuation. Such adjustments
are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview. 

We strive to remain a leader in meeting
the financial service needs of the local community and to provide quality service to the individuals and businesses in the market
areas that we have served since 1853. Historically, we have been a community-oriented provider of traditional banking products
and services to business organizations and individuals, including products such as residential and commercial real estate loans,
commercial and industrial loans, consumer loans and a variety of deposit products. We meet the needs of our local community through
a community-based and service-oriented approach to banking. 

We have adopted a growth-oriented strategy
that continues to focus on increasing commercial lending and residential lending. Our strategy also calls for increasing deposit
relationships, specifically core deposits (defined below), and broadening our product lines and services. We believe that this
business strategy is best for our long-term success and viability, and complements our existing commitment to high-quality customer
service. 

In connection with our overall growth strategy,
we seek to: 

Grow the Company s commercial loan
portfolio and related commercial deposits by targeting businesses in our primary market areas of Hampden and Hampshire Counties
in western Massachusetts and Hartford and Tolland Counties in northern Connecticut to increase the net interest margin and loan
income; 

Supplement the Company s commercial
portfolio by growing the Company s residential real estate portfolio to diversify the Company s loan portfolio and
deepen customer relationships; 

Focus on expanding our retail banking
deposit franchise and increase the number of households served within our designated market area; 

Invest in people, systems and technology
to grow revenue, improve efficiency and enhance the overall customer experience; 

Grow revenues, increase book value and
tangible book value per share (non-GAAP), continue to pay competitive dividends to shareholders and utilize the Company s
stock repurchase plan to leverage our capital and enhance franchise value (tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP measure.
See Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements for more information regarding our uses of non-GAAP financial
measurements); and 

Consider growth through acquisitions.
We may pursue expansion opportunities in existing or adjacent strategic locations with companies that add complementary products
to our existing business and at terms that add value to our existing shareholders. 

You should read the following financial
results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the context of this strategy. 

Net income was 1.9 million, or 0.09
per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 4.5 million, or 0.21 per diluted
share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 8.4 million,
or 0.40 per diluted share, compared to 12.6 million, or 0.58 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Net interest income, our primary driver
of revenues, decreased 1.7 million, or 10.1 , to 14.7 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 16.4 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense of
 3.6 million, or 37.8 , partially offset by an increase in interest and dividend income of 1.9 million, or 7.5 . Interest expense
on deposits increased 3.5 million, or 44.9 , and interest expense on borrowings increased 133,000, or 7.3 . During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased 7.2 million, or 13.9 , to 44.5 million, compared to 51.7 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense of 14.1
million, or 62.3 , partially offset by an increase in interest and dividend income of 6.9 million, or 9.3 . The 14.1 million
increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of 12.9 million, or 72.3 , in interest expense on deposits. Both
periods were impacted by competitive pricing and an unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low cost core deposits to high cost
time deposits. 

41 

During the three months ended September,
30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 941,000, compared to a provision for credit losses of 354,000,
during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September, 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision
for credit losses of 97,000, compared to a provision for credit losses of 386,000 during the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The provision for credit losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to changes in
the economic environment and related adjustments to the quantitative components of the CECL methodology as well as growth in the
loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses was determined by a number of factors: the continued strong credit performance
of the Company s loan portfolio, changes in the loan portfolio mix and Management s consideration of existing economic
conditions and the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve s actions to control inflation. Management continues to monitor
macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes
it is appropriately reserved for the current economic environment. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. 

Our consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management
to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly,
as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Critical accounting estimates are necessary
in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures, and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical
accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially
result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. 

There have been no material changes to
our critical accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information on our critical accounting
policies, please refer to the information contained in Note 1 of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and
Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report. 

COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT
SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND DECEMBER 31, 2023 

At September 30, 2024, total assets were
 2.6 billion, an increase of 75.9 million, or 3.0 , from December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily due to
an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 44.0 million, or 152.4 , an increase in total loans of 21.7 million, or 1.1 , and
an increase in investment securities of 8.7 million, or 2.4 . 

Investment Securities 

At September 30, 2024, the investment securities
portfolio totaled 369.4 million, or 14.0 of total assets, compared to 360.7 million, or 14.1 , of total assets, at December
31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company s available-for-sale AFS securities portfolio, recorded at fair
market value, increased 18.8 million, or 13.7 , from 137.1 million at December 31, 2023 to 155.9 million. The held-to-maturity HTM securities portfolio, recorded at amortized cost, decreased 10.1 million, or 4.5 , from 223.4 million at
December 31, 2023 to 213.3 million at September 30, 2024. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company reported
unrealized losses on the AFS securities portfolio of 24.6 million, or 13.6 of the amortized cost basis of the AFS securities
portfolio, compared to unrealized losses of 29.2 million, or 17.5 of the amortized cost basis of the AFS securities at December
31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized losses on the HTM securities portfolio of 30.7 million, or 14.4 ,
of the amortized cost basis of the HTM securities portfolio, compared to 35.7 million, or 16.0 of the amortized cost basis of
the HTM securities portfolio at December 31, 2023.

The securities in which the Company may
invest are limited by regulation. Federally chartered savings banks have authority to invest in various types of assets, including
U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates
of deposit of insured financial institutions, repurchase agreements, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt
instruments and marketable equity securities. The securities, with the exception of 4.6 million in corporate bonds, are issued
by the United States government or government-sponsored enterprises and are therefore either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed
as to the timely payment of contractual principal and interest. These positions are deemed to have no credit impairment, therefore,
the disclosed unrealized losses with the securities portfolio relate primarily to changes in prevailing interest rates. In all
cases, price improvement in future periods will be realized as the issuances approach maturity. 

Management regularly reviews the portfolio
for securities in an unrealized loss position. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record any credit
impairment charges on its securities portfolio and attributed the unrealized losses primarily due to fluctuations in general interest
rates or changes in expected prepayments and not due to credit quality. The primary objective of the Company s investment
portfolio is to provide liquidity and to secure municipal deposit accounts while preserving the safety of principal. The Company
expects to strategically redeploy available cash flows from the securities portfolio to fund loan growth and deposit outflows. 

Total Loans 

At September 30, 2024, total loans increased
 21.7 million, or 1.1 , from December 31, 2023, to 2.0 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase in total loans was due to an
increase in commercial real estate loans of 3.0 million, or 0.3 , an increase in residential real estate loans, including home
equity loans, of 26.4 million, or 3.7 , partially offset by a decrease in commercial and industrial loans of 7.0 million, or
3.2 . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 20.1 million in fixed rate residential loans to the secondary
market with servicing retained. 

Total delinquency was 4.3 million, or
0.21 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 6.0 million, or 0.30 of total loans at December 31, 2023. At September
30, 2024, nonperforming loans totaled 4.9 million, or 0.24 of total loans, compared to 6.4 million, or 0.32 of total loans,
at December 31, 2023. Total nonperforming assets totaled 4.9 million, or 0.18 of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared
to 6.4 million, or 0.25 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loans
90 or more days past due and still accruing interest. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any
other real estate owned. Management continues to closely monitor the loan portfolio for any signs of deterioration in borrowers 
financial condition and also in light of speculation that commercial real estate values may deteriorate as the market continues
to adjust to higher vacancies and interest rates. We continue to proactively take steps to mitigate risk in our loan portfolio. 

At September 30, 2024, the allowance for
credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.97 as compared to 1.00 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the allowance
for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 409.5 as compared to 315.6 at December 31, 2023. 

Total criticized loans, defined as special
mention and substandard loans, increased 3.7 million, or 9.4 , from 39.5 million, or 1.9 of total loans, at December 31, 2023
to 43.2 million, or 2.1 , of total loans at September 30, 2024. We continue to maintain diversity among property types and within
our geographic footprint. A summary of our past due and nonaccrual loans by class is listed in Note 5 of the accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements. 

The Company s commercial real estate
loans are considered to be relatively diversified by borrower, industry and concentrated in the New England geographical area.
A significant portion of the loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate loans, primarily made in Massachusetts, and to a
lesser degree, Connecticut, and secured by real estate or other collateral in the market. Although these loans are made to a diversified
pool of unrelated borrowers across numerous businesses, adverse developments in the local real estate market could have an adverse
impact on this portfolio of loans and the Company s income and financial position. While our basic market area is in Massachusetts,
the Company has made loans outside that market area where the applicant is an existing customer, and the nature and quality of
such loans was consistent with the Company's lending policies. 

43 

We continuously monitor the asset quality
of our loan portfolio. For the commercial portfolio, we monitor credit quality using a risk rating scale, which assigns a risk-grade
to each borrower based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors associated with a commercial loan transaction. Management
utilizes a loan risk rating methodology based on an 8-point scale. Pass grades are 0-4 and non-pass categories, which align with
regulatory guidelines, include: special mention (5), substandard (6), doubtful (7) and loss (8). Risk rating assignment is determined
by analyzing key factors, which may include: industry and market conditions, position within the industry, earnings trends, operating
cash flow, debt capacity, guarantor strength, management, financial reporting, collateral and other considerations. 

CRE Concentrations 

The
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Agencies issued guidance in 2006 which addresses institutions with increased concentrations
of commercial real estate CRE loans. The guidance does not establish specific CRE lending limits; rather, it promotes
sound risk management practices and appropriate levels of capital that will enable institutions to continue to pursue CRE lending
in a safe and sound manner. In developing this guidance, the Agencies recognized that different types of CRE lending present different
levels of risk, and that consideration should be given to the lower risk profiles and historically superior performance of certain
types of CRE, such as well-structured multifamily housing finance, when compared to others, such as speculative office space construction. 

Institutions are encouraged to segment
their CRE portfolios to acknowledge these distinctions for risk management purposes. The guidance focuses on those CRE loans for
which the cash flow from the real estate is the primary source of repayment rather than loans to a borrower for which real estate
collateral is taken as a secondary source of repayment or through an abundance of caution. Thus, for the purposes of the guidance,
CRE loans include those loans with risk profiles sensitive to the condition of the general CRE market (for example, market demand,
changes in capitalization rates, vacancy rates, or rents). CRE loans are land development and construction loans (including 1-
to 4-family residential and commercial construction loans) and other land loans. CRE loans also include loans secured by multifamily
property, and nonfarm nonresidential property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with
the property (that is, loans for which 50 percent or more of the source of repayment comes from third party, nonaffiliated, rental
income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. Excluded from the scope of this Guidance
are loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties where the primary source of repayment is the cashflow from the ongoing operations
and activities conducted by the party, or affiliate of the party, who owns the property. 

As part of their ongoing supervisory monitoring
processes, the Agencies use certain criteria to identify institutions that are potentially exposed to significant CRE concentration
risk. An institution that has experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, or is approaching
or exceeds the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its
CRE concentration risk: 

1. Total reported loans for construction,
land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of the institution s total risk-based capital; or 

2. Total commercial real estate
loans as defined in this guidance represent 300 percent or more of the institution s total risk-based capital, and the outstanding
balance of the institution s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 percent or more during the prior 36
months. 

The Agencies use the criteria as a preliminary
step to identify institutions that may have CRE concentration risk. Because regulatory reports capture a broad range of CRE loans
with varying risk characteristics, the supervisory monitoring criteria do not constitute limits on an institution s lending
activity but rather serve as high-level indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. 

The Company holds a concentration in commercial
real estate loans. As of September 30, 2024, construction, land development and other land loans represented 37.4 of consolidated
bank risk-based capital. During the prior 36 months, the Company has experienced an increase in its commercial real estate portfolio
of 23.4 . 

44 

The management team has extensive experience
in underwriting commercial real estate loans and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures
and strong underwriting criteria with respect to its commercial real estate portfolio. The Board of Directors has established internal
maximum limits on CRE as an asset class overall as well as sub limits within CRE by property class, to better manage and control
the exposure to property classes during periods of changing economic conditions. The Board of Directors also has minimum targets
for regulatory capital ratios that are in excess of well capitalized ratios. 

Our risk management process begins with
a robust underwriting program. The underwriting and risk rating of all loans is completed by the Company s Credit Department
that is independent of the originating lender(s). 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, non-owner and owner occupied commercial real estate loans, totaled 1.1 billion, or 52.9 , of total gross loans, and 1.1
billion, or 53.3 , of total gross loans, respectively.

The Company also underwrites and originates
owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. These loans are typically term loans made to support properties that rely upon the
operations of the business occupying the property for repayment. The Agencies specifically excluded owner-occupied commercial real
estate from their concentration guidance, as the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities
conducted by the party, or affiliate of the party, who owns the property.

Given prevailing market conditions such
as recent sustained increases in interest rates, reduced occupancy as a result of the increase in hybrid work arrangements post-COVID,
and lower commercial real estate valuations, we carefully monitor these loans for signs of deterioration in credit quality and
other risks. Such heightened monitoring includes incremental risk management strategies undertaken by management, including more
frequent portfolio reviews, ongoing monitoring of market conditions, and additional portfolio analysis, which may include monitoring
concentration limitations, including concentrations by loan type, property type, geographic area and with participants, where applicable,
and risk diversification, tracking aggregated policy and underwriting exceptions and stress testing the loan portfolios. 

Deposits 

Total deposits increased 80.5 million,
or 3.8 , from 2.1 billion at December 31, 2023 to 2.2 billion at September 30, 2024. Core deposits, which the Company defines
as all deposits except time deposits, decreased 8.3 million, or 0.5 , from 1.5 billion, or 71.5 of total deposits, at December
31, 2023, to 1.5 billion, or 68.5 of total deposits, at September 30, 2024. Non-interest-bearing deposits decreased 10.9 million,
or 1.9 , to 568.7 million, money market accounts increased 1.5 million, or 0.2 , to 635.8 million, savings accounts decreased
 8.2 million, or 4.4 , to 179.2 million and interest-bearing checking accounts increased 9.3 million, or 7.1 , to 140.3 million.
Time deposits increased 88.8 million, or 14.5 , from 611.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 700.2 million at September 30, 2024.
Brokered time deposits, which are included in time deposits, totaled 1.7 million at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023.

During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company continued to experience an unfavorable shift in deposit mix from low cost core deposits to high cost time
deposits as customers continue to migrate to higher deposit rates. The Company continues to focus on the maintenance, development,
and expansion of its core deposit base to meet funding requirements and liquidity needs, with an emphasis on retaining a long-term
customer relationship base by competing for and retaining deposits in our local market. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s
uninsured deposits represented 27.7 of total deposits, compared to 26.8 at December 31, 2023. 

50 

Borrowings 

At September 30, 2024, total borrowings
decreased 4.1 million, or 2.6 , from 156.5 million at December 31, 2023 to 152.4 million. Short-term borrowings decreased 11.7
million, or 72.7 , to 4.4 million, compared to 16.1 million at December 31, 2023. Long-term borrowings increased 7.6 million,
or 6.3 , from 120.6 million at December 31, 2023 to 128.3 million at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, borrowings also consisted of 19.7 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. 

The Company utilized the BTFP, which was
created in March 2023 to enhance banking system liquidity by allowing institutions to pledge certain securities at par value and
borrow at a rate of ten basis points over the one-year overnight index swap rate. The BTFP was available to federally insured depository
institutions in the U.S., with advances having a term of up to one year with no prepayment penalties. The BTFP ceased extending
new advances in March 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Company s outstanding balance under the BTFP was 90.0 million. There
were no outstanding balance under the BTFP at September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had
 452.0 million of additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB, 404.9 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Federal
Reserve Bank Discount Window and 25.0 million of other unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks. 

The Company s liquidity position
remains strong with solid core deposit relationships, cash, unencumbered securities, a diversified deposit base and access to diversified
borrowing sources. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 1.1 billion in immediately available liquidity, compared to 615.0 million
in uninsured deposits, or 27.7 of total deposits, representing a coverage ratio of 183 . Uninsured deposits of the Bank s
customers are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance if the customer opens an IntraFi Insured Cash Sweep ICS account or a reciprocal time deposit through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry System CDARS ). IntraFi
allows for up to 250.0 million per customer of pass-through FDIC insurance, which would more than cover each of the Bank s
deposit customers if such customer desired to have such pass-through insurance. 

Capital 

At September 30, 2024, shareholders 
equity was 240.7 million, or 9.1 of total assets, compared to 237.4 million, or 9.3 of total assets, at December 31, 2023.
The change was primarily attributable to a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 3.4 million, cash dividends paid
of 4.5 million, repurchase of shares at a cost of 5.6 million, partially offset by net income of 8.4 million. At September 30,
2024, total shares outstanding were 21,113,408. 

The Company s regulatory capital
ratios continue to be strong and in excess of regulatory minimum requirements to be considered well-capitalized as defined by regulators
and internal Company targets. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 14.4 at September 30, 2024 and 14.7 at December 31, 2023. 
The Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio to adjusted average assets was 9.61 at September 30, 2024 and 9.62 at December 31, 2023.

COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR
THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

General. 

The Company reported net income of 1.9
million, or 0.09 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 4.5 million, or
 0.21 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income decreased 1.7 million, or 10.1 , provision
for credit losses increased 587,000, non-interest income decreased 471,000, or 13.0 , and non-interest expense increased 288,000,
or 2.0 , during the same period. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.29 and 3.19 , respectively, for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.70 and 7.60 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

Net Interest and Dividend Income. 

The following tables set forth the information
relating to our average balance and net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and reflect the
average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. Yields and
costs are derived by dividing interest income by the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest expense by the average
balance of interest-bearing liabilities for the periods shown. The interest rate spread is the difference between the total average
yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin represents tax-equivalent net
interest and dividend income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Average balances are derived from actual daily
balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees earned when the real estate loans are prepaid or refinanced.
For analytical purposes, the interest earned on tax-exempt assets is adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis to recognize the income
tax savings which facilitates comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets.

Rate/Volume Analysis . 

The following table shows
how changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected
our interest and dividend income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with
respect to: (1) interest income changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (2) interest
income changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (3) the net change. 

The changes attributable
to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due
to rate.

(1) Securities, loan income and change in net interest and dividend income are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax
rate of 21 . The tax-equivalent adjustment is deducted from tax-equivalent net interest income to agree to the amount reported
in the consolidated statements of net income. See Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements. 

Net interest income decreased 1.7 million,
or 10.1 , to 14.7 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 16.4 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense of 3.6 million, or 37.8 , partially offset
by an increase in interest and dividend income of 1.9 million, or 7.5 . Interest expense on deposits increased 3.5 million, or
44.9 , and interest expense on borrowings increased 133,000, or 7.3 . The increase in interest expense was a result of competitive
pricing on deposits due to the continued higher interest rate environment and the unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low
cost core deposits to high cost time deposits. 

The net interest margin was 2.40 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin,
on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.72 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing
liabilities and the unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low cost core deposits to high cost time deposits, which was partially
offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the
three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a fair value hedge which contributed to an increase in the net interest
margin of seven basis points. Excluding the interest income from the fair value hedge, the net interest margin was 2.33 and 2.64 ,
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value hedge is
scheduled to mature in October of 2024.

The average yield on interest-earning assets,
without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.28 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average loan yield, without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.90 
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three
months ended September 30, 2024, average interest-earning assets increased 38.2 million, or 1.6 to 2.4 billion, primarily due
to an increase in average loans of 31.3 million, or 1.6 , an increase in average short-term investments, consisting of cash and
cash equivalents, of 9.7 million, or 43.4 , an increase in average other investments of 3.7 million, or 30.8 , partially offset
by a decrease in average securities of 6.5 million, or 1.8 . 

The average cost of total funds, including
non-interest bearing accounts and borrowings, increased 60 basis points from 1.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2023
to 2.24 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits
except time deposits, increased 23 basis points to 0.93 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.70 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of time deposits increased 98 basis points from 3.46 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 to 4.44 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of borrowings, including subordinated
debt, increased 24 basis points from 4.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.05 for the three months ended September
30, 2024. Average demand deposits, an interest-free source of funds, decreased 32.7 million, or 5.5 , from 591.9 million, or
27.5 of total average deposits, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 559.2 million, or 25.7 of total average deposits,
for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Provision for Credit Losses. 

The provision for credit losses is reviewed
by management based upon our evaluation of economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas and other conditions,
such as new loan products, credit quality trends (including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions),
collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, specific industry conditions using reasonable and supportable forecasts and
the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectability of the loan portfolio. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 941,000, compared to a provision for credit losses of 354,000,
during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the loan portfolio, specifically
unfunded commercial real estate loan commitments, as well as changes in the economic environment and related adjustments to the
quantitative components of the CECL methodology. The provision for credit losses was determined by a number of factors: the continued
strong credit performance of the Company s loan portfolio, changes in the loan portfolio mix and Management s consideration
of existing economic conditions and the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve s actions to control inflation. Management
continues to monitor macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn,
and believes it is appropriately reserved for the current economic environment. The Company recorded net charge-offs of 98,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net charge-offs of 78,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

Although we believe that we have established
and maintained the allowance for credit losses at adequate levels, future adjustments may be necessary if economic, real estate
and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. 

Non-interest Income. 

Non-interest income decreased 471,000,
or 13.0 , from 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024. Service charges and fees on deposits increased 196,000, or 9.1 , and income from BOLI increased 16,000, or 3.5 , from
the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September
30, 2024, the Company reported 74,000 in other income from loan-level swap fees on commercial loans and did not have comparable
income during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported
income of 246,000 in mortgage banking activities due to the sale of fixed rate residential loans and did not have comparable income
during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported 10,000
in unrealized gains of marketable equity securities and did not have comparable income during the three months ended September
30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a gain on non-marketable equity investments of
 238,000 and did not have comparable non-interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months
ended September 30, 2023, non-interest income included a non-taxable gain of 778,000 on BOLI death benefits. The Company did not
have comparable income during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the
Company reported a loss on the sales of premises and equipment of 3,000 and did not have comparable expense during the three months
ended September 30, 2024. 

55 

Non-interest Expense. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2024, non-interest expense increased 288,000, or 2.0 , to 14.4 million from 14.1 million, for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Salaries and employee benefits increased 157,000, or 2.0 , to 8.1 million, debit card and ATM processing fees increased
 87,000, or 15.5 , software expenses increased 83,000, or 15.7 , occupancy expense increased 58,000, or 5.0 , data processing
expense increased 45,000, or 5.5 , other non-interest income increased 54,000, or 4.3 , and furniture and equipment related expenses
increased 1,000, or 0.2 . These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of 103,000, or 16.0 , a decrease
in advertising expense of 91,000, or 25.1 , and a decrease in FDIC insurance expense of 3,000, or 0.9 . 

For the three months ended September 30,
2024, the efficiency ratio was 80.6 , compared to 70.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, the adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 80.7 compared to 74.4 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increases in the efficiency ratio and the non-GAAP adjusted efficiency ratio were driven by lower
revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Explanation
of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements for the related efficiency ratio calculation and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP
financial measures. 

Income Taxes. 

Income tax expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 was 618,000, or an effective tax rate of 24.5 , compared to 1.0 million, or an effective tax rate of
18.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included
 778,000 in non-taxable BOLI death benefits. 

COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

General. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, the Company reported net income of 8.4 million, or 0.40 per diluted share, compared to 12.6 million, or 0.58 per diluted
share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.44 and 4.74 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.66 and 7.19 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, respectively. 

Net Interest and Dividend Income. 

The following tables set forth the information
relating to our average balance and net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and reflect the
average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. Yields and
costs are derived by dividing interest income by the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest expense by the average
balance of interest-bearing liabilities for the periods shown. The interest rate spread is the difference between the total average
yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin represents tax-equivalent net
interest and dividend income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Average balances are derived from actual daily
balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees earned when the real estate loans are prepaid or refinanced.
For analytical purposes, the interest earned on tax-exempt assets is adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis to recognize the income
tax savings which facilitates comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets.

(1) Securities, loan income and change in net interest and dividend income are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax
rate of 21 . The tax-equivalent adjustment is deducted from tax-equivalent net interest income to agree to the amount reported
in the consolidated statements of net income. See Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, net interest income decreased 7.2 million, or 13.9 , to 44.5 million, compared to 51.7 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense of 14.1 million, or 62.3 ,
partially offset by an increase in interest and dividend income of 6.9 million, or 9.3 . The 14.1 million increase in interest
expense was primarily due to an increase of 12.9 million, or 72.3 , in interest expense on deposits as a result of competitive
pricing and an unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low cost core deposits to high cost time deposits. 

The net interest margin for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was 2.46 , compared to 2.88 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin,
on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.48 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.90 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing
liabilities and the unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low cost core to high cost time deposits, which was partially offset
by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a fair value hedge which contributed to an increase in the net interest margin of seven
and three basis points, respectively. Excluding the interest income from the fair value hedge, the net interest margin was 2.39 
and 2.85 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value
hedge is scheduled to mature in October of 2024. 

The average yield on interest-earning assets,
without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.14 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average loan yield, without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.86 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, average interest-earning assets increased 14.5 million, or 0.6 , to 2.4 billion, from the same period
in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in average loans of 23.4 million, or 1.2 , an increase in average short-term
investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, of 5.7 million, or 44.2 , and an increase in other interest-earning assets
of 1.7 million, or 13.7 , partially offset by a decrease in average securities of 16.3 million, or 4.4 . 

58 

The average cost of total funds, including
non-interest bearing accounts and borrowings, increased 80 basis points from 1.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
to 2.12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits
except time deposits, increased 24 basis points to 0.86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.62 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of time deposits increased 160 basis points from 2.72 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to 4.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of borrowings, including subordinated
debt, increased 15 basis points from 4.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.99 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. Average demand deposits, an interest-free source of funds, decreased 52.1 million, or 8.6 , from 607.3 million, or
28.0 of total average deposits, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 555.3 million, or 25.8 of total average deposits,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Provision for Credit Losses. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 97,000, compared to a provision for credit losses of 386,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to changes in the loan mix as well as economic
environment and related adjustments to the quantitative components of the CECL methodology. The provision for credit losses was
determined by a number of factors: the continued strong credit performance of the Company s loan portfolio, changes in the
loan portfolio mix and Management s consideration of existing economic conditions and the economic outlook from the Federal
Reserve s actions to control inflation. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest
rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes it is appropriately reserved for the current economic environment. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company recorded net charge-offs of 41,000 compared to net charge-offs of 1.9 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were related to one commercial relationship
acquired in October 2016 from Chicopee Bancorp, Inc. The Company recorded a 1.9 million charge-off on the relationship, which
represented the non-accretable credit mark that was required to be grossed-up to the loan s amortized cost basis with a corresponding
increase to the allowance for credit losses under the CECL implementation. 

Although we believe that we have established
and maintained the allowance for credit losses at adequate levels, future adjustments may be necessary if economic, real estate
and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. 

Non-interest Income. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, non-interest income increased 1.5 million, or 17.9 , from 8.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to
 9.6 million. Service charges and fees on deposits increased 328,000, or 5.0 , and income from BOLI increased 37,000, or 2.7 . 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company reported a gain of 987,000 on non-marketable equity investments, compared to a gain of 590,000 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported income of 246,000
from mortgage banking activities due to the sale of fixed rate residential real estate loans and did not have comparable income
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported 74,000
in other income from loan-level swap fees on commercial loans and did not have comparable income during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported 22,000 in unrealized gains of marketable equity
securities and did not have comparable income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gains and losses from the investment
portfolio vary from quarter to quarter based on market conditions, as well as the related yield curve and valuation changes. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a loss on the sales of premises and equipment of 6,000 compared
to 3,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded
a 1.1 million final termination expense related to the defined benefit pension plan termination. The Company did not have comparable
income or expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, non-interest
income included a non-taxable gain of 778,000 on BOLI death benefits. The Company did not have comparable income during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

59 

Non-interest Expense. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, non-interest expense decreased 63,000, or 0.1 , to 43.5 million, compared to 43.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of 513,000, or 23.3 , a decrease
in salaries and employee benefits of 218,000, or 0.9 , a decrease in advertising expense of 159,000, or 14.2 , a decrease in
other non-interest expense of 120,000, or 2.9 , and a decrease in furniture and equipment related expense of 10,000, or 0.7 .
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in software related expenses of 309,000, or 19.7 , an increase in debit card
and ATM processing fees of 264,000, or 16.7 , an increase in data processing of 208,000, or 8.8 , an increase in FDIC insurance
expense of 88,000, or 9.0 , and an increase in occupancy expense of 88,000, or 2.4 . 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, the efficiency ratio was 80.3 , compared to 72.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 81.8 compared to 73.0 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increases in the efficiency ratio and the non-GAAP adjusted efficiency ratio were driven by lower
revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Explanation
of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements for the related efficiency ratio calculation and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP
financial measures. 

Income Taxes. 

Income tax expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was 2.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 20.9 , compared to 3.4 million, representing
an effective tax rate of 21.3 , for nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measurements. 

We believe that it is common practice in
the banking industry to present interest income and related yield information on tax-exempt loans and securities on a tax-equivalent
basis, as well as presenting tangible book value per share and adjusted efficiency ratio, and that such information is useful to
investors because it facilitates comparisons among financial institutions. However, the adjustment of interest income and yields
on tax-exempt loans and securities to a tax-equivalent amount, as well as the presentation of tangible book value per share and
adjusted efficiency ratio, may be considered to include financial information that is not in compliance with GAAP. A reconciliation
from GAAP to non-GAAP is provided below.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources. 

Liquidity Management 

The term liquidity refers
to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash flows to meet all present and future funding requirements at reasonable costs.
The Company s primary source of liquidity is deposits, primarily core deposits. While our preferred funding strategy is to
attract and retain low cost deposits, our ability to do so is affected by competitive interest rates and terms in the marketplace.
Other sources of funding include discretionary use of wholesale funding, such as FHLB term advances, other borrowings and brokered
deposits, cash flows from our investment securities portfolios, loan sales, loan repayments and earnings. Although the Company
currently does not have the intent and has the ability to hold investment securities, the Company may also sell securities available-for-sale
in response to short-term or long-term liquidity needs. 

61 

The Company s liquidity positions
are monitored daily by management. The Asset Liability Committee establishes guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels
of liquidity. The Company has a detailed liquidity funding policy and a contingency funding plan that provide for the prompt and
comprehensive response to unexpected demands for liquidity. Management employs a stress testing methodology to estimate needs for
contingent funding that could result from unexpected outflows of funds in excess of business as usual cash flows
to ensure a strong liquidity position. Included in the calculation are assumptions of some significant deposit run-off as
well as funds needed for loan funding and investment purchases. The Company does not anticipate engaging in any activities,
either currently or over the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and which would therefore result in significant
pressure on liquidity. However, an economic recession could negatively impact the Company s liquidity. The Company
relies heavily on the FHLB as a source of funds, particularly with its overnight line of credit. In past economic recessions,
some FHLB branches have suspended dividends, cut dividend payments, and suspended the purchase of excess FHLB stock that members
hold in an effort to conserve capital. FHLB has stated that it expects to be able to continue to pay dividends, redeem excess
capital stock, and provide competitively priced advances in the future. 

At September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, outstanding borrowings with the FHLB were 128.3 million and 40.6 million, respectively. At September 30,
2024, the Company had 452.0 million in available borrowing capacity with the FHLB, which includes the Ideal Way Line of Credit.
The Company has the ability to increase its borrowing capacity with the FHLB by pledging additional eligible loans and eligible
investment securities. 

At September 30, 2024,
the Company had available borrowing capacity of 404.9 million with the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window FRB Discount
Window at an interest rate determined and reset on a daily basis and secured by eligible commercial and industrial loans
and investment securities not otherwise pledged. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no advances outstanding
under the FRB Discount Window. 

The Company s liquidity position
remains strong with solid core deposit relationships, cash, unencumbered securities, a diversified deposit base and access to diversified
borrowing sources. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 1.1 billion in immediately available liquidity, compared to 615.0 million
in uninsured deposits, or 27.7 of total deposits, representing a coverage ratio of 183 . Uninsured deposits of the Bank s
customers are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance if the customer opens an ICS account or a reciprocal time deposit through
CDARS. IntraFi allows for up to 250.0 million per customer of pass-through FDIC insurance, which would more than cover each of
the Bank s deposit customers if such customer desired to have such pass-through insurance. 

On March 12, 2023, the Federal Reserve
Bank made available the BTFP to enhance banking system liquidity by allowing institutions to pledge certain securities at par value
and borrow at a rate of ten basis points over the one-year overnight index swap rate. The BTFP was available to federally insured
depository institutions in the U.S., with advances having a term of up to one year with no prepayment penalties. The BTFP ceased
extending new advances in March 2024. At December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance under the BTFP was 90.0 million. There was
no outstanding balance at September 30, 2024. 

In addition, the Company
also maintains unsecured lines of credits totaling 25.0 with two correspondent banks. Interest rates on these lines are determined
and reset on a daily basis by each respective bank. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding
under these lines of credit. In addition, we may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with approved broker-dealers. Reverse
repurchase agreements are agreements that allow us to borrow money using our securities as collateral. 

The Company has outstanding
at any time, a significant number of commitments to extend credit and provide financial guarantees to third parties. These arrangements
are subject to strict credit control assessments. Guarantees specify limits to our obligations. Because many commitments and almost
all guarantees expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows. We
are also obligated under agreements with the FHLB to repay borrowed funds and are obligated under leases for certain of our branches
and equipment. 

62 

Maturing investment securities
are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed
securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace.
These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. 

The Company s primary
activities are the origination of commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans,
as well as and the purchase of mortgage-backed and other investment securities. At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately
 127.5 million in loan commitments and letters of credit to borrowers and approximately 343.6 million in available home equity
and other unadvanced lines of credit. 

Deposit inflows and outflows are affected
by the level of interest rates, the products and interest rates offered by competitors and by other factors. At September 30, 2024,
time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year totaled 689.1 million, or 98.4 of the time deposit portfolio. Based
on the Company s deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these
time deposits will remain on deposit. We monitor our liquidity position frequently and anticipate that it will have sufficient
funds to meet our current funding commitments for the next 12 months and beyond. 

Material Cash Commitments 

The Company entered into
a long-term contractual obligation with a vendor for use of its core provider and ancillary services beginning in 2016. Total remaining
contractual obligations outstanding with this vendor as of September 30, 2024 were estimated to be 7.0 million, with 5.0 million
expected to be paid within one year and the remaining 2.0 million to be paid within the next three years. Further, the Company
has operating leases for certain of its banking offices and ATMs. Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than one year to
fourteen years, some of which include options to extend the leases for additional five-year terms up to ten years. Undiscounted
lease liabilities totaled 9.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Principal payments expected to be made on our lease liabilities
during the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 were 1.5 million. The remaining lease liability payments totaled 7.8 million
and are expected to be made after September 30, 2025. 

In addition, the Company
completed an offering of 20 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.875 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the
 Notes to certain qualified institutional buyers in a private placement transaction on April 20, 2021. Unless earlier
redeemed, the Notes mature on May 1, 2031. At September 30, 2024, 19.7 million aggregate principle amount of the Notes was outstanding.
The Notes will bear interest from the initial issue date to, but excluding, May 1, 2026, or the earlier redemption date, at a fixed
rate of 4.875 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on May 1, August 1, November 1 and February 1 of each year, beginning August
1, 2021, and from and including May 1, 2026, but excluding the maturity date or earlier redemption date, equal to the benchmark
rate, which is the 90-day average secured overnight financing rate, plus 412 basis points, determined on the determination date
of the applicable interest period, payable quarterly in arrears on May 1, August 1, November 1 and February 1 of each year. The
Company may also redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on or after May 1, 2026, and at any time upon the occurrence of certain
events, subject in each case to the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. 

We do not anticipate
any material capital expenditures during the calendar year 2024, except in pursuance of the Company s strategic initiatives.
The Company does not have any balloon or other payments due on any long-term obligations or any off-balance sheet items other than
the commitments and unused lines of credit noted above. 

At September 30, 2024,
we exceeded each of the applicable regulatory capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the most recent notification from
the Office of Comptroller of the Currency categorized the Bank as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework
for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based,
Tier 1 risk-based, Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no
conditions or events since that notification that management believes would change our category. 

The Company s and Bank s regulatory
capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in the table below.
