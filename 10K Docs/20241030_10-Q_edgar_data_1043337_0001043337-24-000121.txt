 The Company conducts business internationally and, therefore, is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions, inventory purchases and other foreign currency exposures. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the Mexican peso currency in 2024 and 2023. These forward contracts were executed to hedge forecasted transactions and have been accounted for as cash flow hedges. As such, gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, to the extent that hedges are effective, until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings. Unrealized amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of hedge derivative contracts at each reporting period. The cash flow hedges were highly effective. The effectiveness of the transactions was measured using regression analysis and forecasted future purchases of the currency. 
 In certain instances, the foreign currency forward contracts may not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges and, therefore, are marked-to-market with gains and losses recognized in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of other (income) expense, net. At September 30, 2024, all of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were designated as cash flow hedges. 
 The Company s foreign currency forward contracts offset a portion of the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions as follows: 
 Mexican peso-denominated Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Company holds Mexican peso-denominated foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount at September 30, 2024 of , which expire ratably on a monthly basis from October 2024 to December 2025 . The notional amounts at December 31, 2023 related to Mexican peso-denominated foreign currency forward contracts were .

 to hedge its exposure to interest payment fluctuations on a portion of its Credit Facility borrowings. The Swap matured on March 10, 2023. The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variable interest rate obligation under the Company's Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, (the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ). Accordingly, the change in fair value of the Swap was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Swap agreement required monthly settlements on the same days that the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement interest payments were due. The Swap's maturity date of March 10, 2023, was before the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement maturity date of June 5, 2024. Under the Swap terms, the Company paid a fixed interest rate and received a floating interest rate based on the one-month LIBOR, with a floor. The critical terms of the Swap were aligned with the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement , resulting in no hedge ineffectiveness. The difference between amounts to be received and paid under the Swap were recognized as a component of interest expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Swap settlements reduced interest expense, net by for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Fair Value Measurements 
 Certain assets and liabilities held by the Company are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the three levels of the fair value hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs used. Fair values estimated using Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Fair values estimated using Level 2 inputs, other than quoted prices, are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly and include among other things, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are active or inactive as well as inputs other than quoted prices that are observable. For forward currency and cross-currency contracts, inputs include forward foreign currency exchange rates. For the interest rate swap, inputs included LIBOR. Fair values estimated using Level 3 inputs consist of significant unobservable inputs.

 and , respectively, related to groundwater remediation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized expense of and , respectively, related to groundwater remediation. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company accrued and , respectively, related to expected future remediation costs. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, were recorded as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets while the remaining amounts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were recorded as a component of other long-term liabilities. Costs associated with the recorded liability will be incurred to complete the groundwater remediation and monitoring. The recorded liability is based on assumptions in the remedial action plan as well as estimates for future remediation activities. Although the Company sold the Sarasota facility and related property in December 2011, the liability to remediate the site contamination remains the responsibility of the Company. Due to the ongoing site remediation, the Company is currently required to maintain a letter of credit for the benefit of the buyer. 
 The Company s Stoneridge Brazil subsidiary has civil, labor and other tax contingencies (excluding income tax) for which the likelihood of loss is deemed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, by the Company s legal advisors in Brazil. As a result, no provision has been recorded with respect to these contingencies, which amounted to R and R at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. An unfavorable outcome on these contingencies could result in significant cost to the Company and adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. 
 On August 12, 2020, the Brazilian Administrative Counsel for Economic Defense CADE issued a ruling against Stoneridge Brazil for abuse of dominance and market foreclosure through its prior use of exclusivity provisions in agreements with its distributors. The CADE tribunal imposed a R fine which is included in the reasonably possible contingencies noted above. The Company continues to challenge this ruling in Brazilian federal court to reverse this decision by the CADE tribunal. 
 Long Term Supply Commitment 
 In 2022, the Company entered into a long term supply agreement, as amended, with a supplier for the purchase of certain electronic semiconductor components through December 31, 2027. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company paid capacity deposits of each in December 2022 and June 2023. The capacity deposits are recognized in prepaid and other current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and amortized ratably over the life of the purchase commitment. This long term supply agreement requires the Company to purchase minimum annual volumes while requiring the supplier to sell these components at a fixed price. The Company purchased and of these components during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company is required to purchase , , and of these components in each of the years 2024 through 2027, respectively. 
 Product Warranty and Recall 
 Amounts accrued for product warranty and recall claims are established based on the Company s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold as of the balance sheet dates. These accruals are based on several factors including past experience, production changes, industry developments and various other considerations. Our estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and claim payment amounts, combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims, forecasts of the resolution of existing claims, expected future claims on products sold and commercial discussions with our customers. The key factors in our estimate are the warranty period and the customer source. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience material claims or that it will not incur significant costs to defend or settle such claims beyond the amounts accrued. The current portion of the product warranty and recall reserve is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Product warranty and recall reserve included and of a long-term liability at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is included as a component of other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) implemented a 15 global corporate minimum tax ("Pillar Two") to ensure that large multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax in the countries they operate. During 2023, many countries took steps to incorporate Pillar Two into their domestic laws. In 2024, we do not expect a material change to our income tax provision in connection with Pillar Two. As additional jurisdictions implement this legislation, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 We are a global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic systems, components and modules primarily for the automotive, commercial, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes related thereto and other financial information included elsewhere herein. 
 
 Segments 
 We are organized by products produced and markets served. Under this structure, our operations have been reported using the following segments: 
 Control Devices. This segment includes results of operations that manufacture actuators, sensors, switches and connectors. 
 Electronics. This segment includes results of operations from the production of driver information systems, vision and safety systems, connectivity and compliance products and electronic control units. 
 Stoneridge Brazil. This segment includes results of operations that design and manufacture vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services, vehicle security alarms and convenience accessories, in-vehicle audio and infotainment devices, driver information systems and telematics solutions. 
 
 Third Quarter Overview 
 The Company had net loss of 7.1 million, or (0.26) per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased by 9.2 million, or (0.33) per diluted share, from net income of 2.2 million, or 0.08 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss increased due to lower contribution from lower sales offset by a reduction in SG A spending and the favorable impact of non-operating foreign currency gains. Net sales decreased by 24.3 million, or 10.2 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from lower volumes in our North American automotive market for our Control Devices segment and lower volumes in our European and North American commercial vehicle and European off-highway markets for our Electronics segment . Gross margin as a percent of sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 20.8 from 22.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by lower contribution from lower sales offset by favorable sales mix, material cost improvements and a reduction in adverse foreign exchange related material variances. 
 Our Control Devices segment net sales decreased by 18.1 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of decreases in our North American automotive and China commercial vehicle markets. The decrease in our North American automotive market was due to lower customer volumes including electronic and hybrid vehicle platforms and the expected wind down of end-of-life programs. These decreases were offset by sales increases in our China automotive and North American commercial vehicle markets. Segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased due to lower contribution from lower sales levels. Segment operating income decreased due to lower contribution from lower sales volumes and higher SG A spending offset by lower D D spending. 
 Our Electronics segment net sales decreased by 5.3 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower sales volumes in our European and North American commercial vehicle markets, partially mitigated by the ramp-up of recently launched programs, including a European MirrorEye OEM program and our next generation tachograph. We also experienced lower sales volume in our European off-highway vehicle market. Additionally, net sales decreased due to lower electronic component spot buy purchases, which are material purchases reimbursed by customers and recorded as both revenue and offsetting material cost. Offsetting these sales decreases was the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Segment gross margin as a percent of sales decreased compared to the prior year third quarter as lower contribution from lower sales levels was offset by material cost improvements and a reduction in foreign exchange related material variances. O perating income for the segment decreased compared to the third quarter of 2023 because of lower contribution from lower sales levels and higher D D because of lower customer reimbursements offset by lower SG A from 2023 business realignment costs. 
 Our Stoneridge Brazil segment net sales decreased by 6.7 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily from unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.7 million, and lower monitoring service fees that were offset by higher OEM and aftermarket product sales. Operating income decreased due to the adverse impact of U.S. dollar denominated material purchases and unfavorable sales mix from lower monitoring service fees offset by lower SG A spending.

 In the third quarter of 2024, SG A expenses decreased by 1.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 driven primarily by lower incentive compensation, business realignment costs and professional services partially offset by higher wages and self-insured medical costs. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, D D costs decreased by 0.2 million compared to the prior year third quarter from reduced launch activities that resulted in lower wages and consulting being mostly offset by lower customer reimbursements in our Electronics and Control Devices segments. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents balances primarily held at our foreign locations of 54.1 million and 40.8 million, respectively, and we had 196.3 million and 189.3 million, respectively, in borrowings outstanding on our Credit Facility. The 2024 increase in cash and cash equivalents was mostly due to cash generated from operating activities including a reduction in accounts receivable and inventory balances. 
 
 Outlook 
 The Company believes that focusing on products that address industry megatrends has had and will continue to have a positive effect on both our top-line growth and underlying margins. Expanding on our existing products and technology platforms with advanced capabilities, applications and data services is core to our long-term strategy. For example, the Company is aligned with platforms likely to perform well against overall market dynamics including light-trucks, SUVs and crossover vehicles and our continued focus on safety, vehicle intelligence and connectivity based products, such as our ongoing launches of our OEM MirrorEye programs in North America and Europe as well as our next generation tachograph in Europe. In addition, we are partnering with an OEM to develop advanced system capabilities based on data services, software and AI in bus applications. 
 Based on IHS Market production forecasts, the North American automotive market is expected to slightly decrease from 15.6 million units in 2023 to 15.5 million units in 2024 and then to 15.3 million units in 2025. In our Control Devices segment, we remain focused on drivetrain agnostic technologies to drive new business awards as the market continues to evolve. This strategy is highlighted by our recent new business award for a leak detection module product which provides further global opportunities primarily for hybrid vehicle applications, a market that we expect to continue to grow, and is also applicable to traditional powertrain vehicles. We continue to focus on operational excellence and enterprise-wide cost reduction, including material cost reduction plans, to continue to drive margin improvement going-forward. 
 Based on IHS Market production forecasts, in 2025 the European and North American commercial vehicle end market volumes are forecasted to increase 10.0 and 4.4 , respectively. Over the long-term, we expect our Electronics segment sales to outperform forecasted changes in production volumes due to strong demand for our existing products and the impact of ongoing launches of our OEM MirrorEye programs in North America and Europe as well as our next generation tachograph in Europe. During 2024, sales related to our recent MirrorEye OEM program launch have been lower than anticipated, however we expect continued growth in MirrorEye as we launch new OEM programs in both North America and Europe and our equipment becomes standard on key truck platforms for existing OEM programs. 
 In our Electronics segment recovery from customers related to spot buys of materials purchased by the Company on behalf of those customers, which is recognized as revenue and material costs, increased net sales by 14.6 million for the full year 2023. As a result of supply chains normalizing and material availability improving, the Company did not incur any spot buy material purchases in the first nine months of 2024 and does not expect to incur additional spot buy material purchases in the future based on current market conditions. 
 For the remainder of 2024, we expect net D D spending to remain relatively stable driven by reduced launch activities, and as a result, we expect lower customer reimbursements and capitalization of software development costs. We continue to execute our strategy to optimize our engineering footprint to enhance capabilities and capacity for the most efficient return on our engineering spend including the reorganization of our Solna, Sweden location which resulted in business realignment expense of 1.5 million in 2024. 
 In October 2024, the International Monetary Fund forecasted the Brazil gross domestic product to grow 2.2 in 2025, a decline from forecasted growth of 3.0 in 2024. We expect our served market channels to remain relatively stable in 2024 based on current market and economic conditions, however our sales of in region OEM products have been lower than expected due to lower customer demand. Stoneridge Brazil continues to focus on growing our OEM capabilities in-region to better support our global customers. We expect this strategy will provide opportunities for future growth and a platform to continue to rotate our local portfolio to more closely align with our global products. In addition, we continue to align our global engineering capabilities and footprint by expanding our Brazilian engineering center. 
 While we expect continued challenges across our end markets for the remainder of the year and into 2025, we continue to focus on operating performance and enterprise-wide cost reduction. We remain focused on improving cash generation and the reduction of debt through targeted actions to reduce net working capital, particularly our inventory levels, from both the impact of our Electronics segment product launches normalizing and specific inventory reduction actions.

 We expect higher interest expense in 2024 driven by higher outstanding balances on our Credit Facility. 
 Our future effective tax rate depends on various factors, such as changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles and our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We monitor these factors and the impact on our effective tax rate. 
 
 Other Matters 
 A significant portion of our sales are outside of the United States. These sales are generated by our non-U.S. based operations, and therefore, movements in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on our results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant portion of our raw materials purchased by our Electronics and Stoneridge Brazil segments are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore movements in foreign currency exchange rates can also have a significant effect on our results of operations. The U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Argentine peso in 2024 favorably impacting our reported results. 
 We regularly evaluate the performance of our businesses and their cost structures, including personnel, and make necessary changes thereto in order to optimize our results. We also evaluate the required skill sets of our personnel and periodically make strategic changes. As a consequence of these actions, we incur severance and resignation related costs that we refer to as business realignment charges. Business realignment costs of 0.3 million and 1.2 million were incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Because of the competitive nature of the markets we serve, we face pricing pressures from our customers in the ordinary course of business. In response to these pricing pressures we have been able to effectively manage our production costs by the combination of lowering certain costs and limiting the increase of others, the net impact of which to date has not been material. However, if we are unable to effectively manage production costs in the future to mitigate future pricing pressures, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

Table of Contents 

 Our Control Devices segment net sales decreased 16.2 million because of decreases in our North American automotive and China commercial vehicle markets of 21.0 million and 5.3 million, respectively. The decrease in our North American automotive market was primarily due to lower customer volumes including electronic and hybrid vehicle platforms and the expected wind down of end-of-life programs. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our China automotive, North American commercial vehicle and off highway markets of 3.5 million, 2.7 million and 2.1 million, respectively. 
 Our Electronics segment net sales decreased 7.2 million because of lower customer production volumes in our European and North American commercial vehicle markets of 1.7 million and 1.7 million, respectively, mitigated by the ramp-up of recently launched programs, including a European OEM MirrorEye program and our next generation tachograph. We experienced lower sales volumes in our European off-highway vehicle and agricultural markets of 4.5 million and 1.3 million, respectively. Net sales also decreased because of the 2023 impact of required electronic component spot buy purchases of 0.9 million. Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 were favorably impacted by euro and Swedish krona foreign currency translation of 2.4 million compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Our Stoneridge Brazil segment net sales decreased 0.9 million from unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.7 million, and lower monitoring service fees that were offset by higher OEM and aftermarket product sales. 
 Net sales by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands): 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Dollar decrease Percent decrease North America 109,395 51.1 126,499 53.1 (17,104) (13.5) South America 13,219 6.2 14,168 6.0 (949) (6.7) Europe and Other 91,217 42.7 97,497 40.9 (6,280) (6.4) Total net sales 213,831 100.0 238,164 100.0 (24,333) (10.2) 
 The decrease in North American net sales was mostly attributable to a decrease in sales volume in our automotive market of 21.1 million. The decrease in our North American automotive market was primarily caused by lower customer volumes including electronic and hybrid vehicle platforms and by the expected wind down of end-of-life programs. These decreases were offset by higher sales in our off-highway and commercial vehicle markets of 2.0 million and 1.0 million, respectively. 
 The decrease in net sales in South America was from unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.7 million, and lower monitoring service fees that were offset by higher OEM and aftermarket product sales. 
 The decrease in net sales in Europe and Other was due to decreases in customer production volumes in our China and European commercial vehicle markets of 5.1 million and 1.7 million, respectively, as well as a decrease in our European off-highway market of 4.5 million. In addition, we experienced a decrease in electronic component spot buys of 0.7 million. These decreases were offset by higher sales in our China automotive market of 3.5 million. Net sales were impacted by a favorable foreign currency translation of 2.6 million. 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin . Cost of goods sold decreased compared to the third quarter of 2023 and our gross margin decreased from 22.0 in the third quarter of 2023 to 20.8 in the third quarter of 2024. Our material cost as a percentage of net sales decreased to 57.2 in the third quarter of 2024 from 58.1 in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in material cost percentage was due to favorable product mix and material cost improvements as well as a reduction in foreign exchange related material variances. Overhead as a percentage of net sales was 17.3 and 14.9 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in overhead as a percentage of sales was attributable to lower sales as overhead spending was consistent with the prior year quarter. 
 Our Control Devices segment gross margin decreased primarily because of lower contribution from lower sales offset by improved sales mix. 
 Our Electronics segment gross margin decreased from the prior year third quarter as lower contribution from lower sales levels and higher overhead spending were partially offset by lower direct material from material cost improvements and a reduction in foreign exchange related material variances. 
 Our Stoneridge Brazil segment gross margin decreased primarily because of the adverse impact of U.S. dollar denominated material purchases and unfavorable sales mix from lower monitoring service fees. 
 Selling, General and Administrative. SG A expenses decreased by 1.6 million primarily because of lower incentive compensation, business realignment costs and p rofessional services being offset by higher wages and self-insured medical costs.

 Net Sales. Net sales for our reportable segments, excluding inter-segment sales, are summarized in the following table (in thousands ): Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Dollar decrease Percent decrease Control Devices 230,186 33.3 267,406 35.8 (37,220) (13.9) Electronics 422,777 61.3 435,565 58.4 (12,788) (2.9) Stoneridge Brazil 37,084 5.4 43,332 5.8 (6,248) (14.4) Total net sales 690,047 100.0 746,303 100.0 (56,256) (7.5) 
 Our Control Devices segment net sales decreased 37.2 million because of decreases in our North American automotive market of 44.0 million, including lower demand for electronic and hybrid vehicle platforms and the impact of expected end of life production for certain programs, as well as decreases in our China commercial vehicle market of 3.2 million. These decreases were offset by increases in our China automotive, North American commercial vehicle and off highway markets of 2.6 million, 2.1 million and 2.1 million, respectively. The decreases were also offset by negotiated price increases of 1.2 million. In addition, net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.7 million. 
 Our Electronics segment net sales decreased 12.8 million primarily due to the 2023 impacts of both lower required electronic component spot buy purchases of 14.2 million, a reduction in retroactive price increases of 2.6 million, as well as lower sales in our European off-highway vehicle and agricultural markets of 3.3 million and 3.1 million, respectively. Offsetting these decreases were higher sales volumes in our European and North American commercial vehicle markets of 4.7 million and 1.3 million, respectively. In addition, we experienced higher sales volumes in our North American off-highway vehicle market of 2.2 million and favorable euro and Swedish krona foreign currency translation of 1.8 million compared to the prior year. 
 Our Stoneridge Brazil segment net sales decreased because of lower sales of our OEM products, monitoring service fees and tracking devices offset by an increase in aftermarket product sales. In addition, net sales were adversely impacted by an increase in unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.8 million.

 Net sales by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Dollar decrease Percent decrease North America 349,025 50.6 385,813 51.7 (36,788) (9.5) South America 37,084 5.4 43,332 5.8 (6,248) (14.4) Europe and Other 303,938 44.0 317,158 42.5 (13,220) (4.2) Total net sales 690,047 100.0 746,303 100.0 (56,256) (7.5) 
 The decrease in North American net sales was mostly attributable to decreases in sales volume in our automotive market of 44.1 million primarily caused by lower customer volumes including electronic and hybrid vehicle platforms and the impact of expected end of life production for certain programs as well as the 2023 impact of required electronic component spot buy purchases of 2.4 million. These decreases were offset by higher sales volume in our North American off-highway and commercial vehicle markets of 4.3 million and 3.2 million, respectively. 
 The decrease in net sales in South America was primarily due to lower sales of our OEM products, monitoring service fees and tracking devices offset by an increase in aftermarket products. In addition, net sales were adversely impacted by an increase in unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1.8 million. 
 The decrease in net sales in Europe and Other was due to 2023 required customer recoveries of electronic component spot buys of 11.7 million and the change in negotiated price increases o f 1.5 million. In addition, we experienced decreases in our European off-highway and agriculture markets and China commercial vehicle markets of 3.3 million, 2.8 million and 2.8 million, respectively. These sales decreases were offset by increases in our European commercial vehicle market, including sales related to the launches of a European OEM MirrorEye program and our next generation tachograph, and China automotive markets of 4.8 million and 2.6 million, respectively, as well as favorable foreign currency translation of 1.1 million. 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin. Cost of goods sold decreased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and our gross margin increased from 20.9 in the first nine months of 2023 to 21.2 in the first nine months of 2024. Our material cost as a percentage of net sales decreased from 59.6 in the first nine months of 2023 to 57.3 in the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in material cost percentage was partially due to the impact of 2023 required electronic component spot buy purchases, reimbursed by customers. The impact of these spot buy purchases increased cost of goods sold by 14.4 million, or 1.9 of sales, for the first nine months of 2023, which reduced gross margin percent by 0.4 in 2023. Other factors contributing to the reduction in material costs were favorable product mix, material cost improvements and a reduction in foreign exchange related material variances. Overhead as a percentage of net sales was 16.7 and 14.6 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in overhead as a percentage of sales was attributable to higher overhead spending including higher warranty related expense and capitalized software development cost amortization as well as adverse leverage from lower sales levels. 
 Our Control Devices segment gross margin increased primarily as a result of favorable sales mix despite lower sales levels. 
 Our Electronics segment gross margin remained consistent because of the reduction of the adverse effect of required electronic component spot buy purchases, net of customer recoveries, favorable sales mix, material cost improvement actions and a reduction in foreign exchange related material variances. 
 Our Stoneridge Brazil segment gross margin decreased primarily because of lower contribution on lower sales levels. 
 Selling, General and Administrative. SG A expenses decreased by 2.6 million from a combination of lower consulting fees, business realignment costs and incentive compensation offset by higher self-insured medical costs and legal fees as well as a 2023 gain on the sale of fixed assets. 
 Design and Development. D D costs decreased by 3.8 million from a reduction in launch activities that resulted in lower consulting, wages and recruiting being partially offset by lower capitalization of software development costs and customer reimbursements for our Electronics and Control Devices segments as well as higher Electronics business realignment costs.

Our operating results in Europe and Other increased primarily because of lower direct material costs and SG A and D D spending offset by lower contribution from lower sales levels. 
 Interest Expense, net. Interest expense, net was 11.0 million and 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was the result of higher outstanding Credit Facility balances. 
 Equity in Loss of Investee. Equity loss for Autotech Fund II was 1.1 million and 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively . 
 Other (Income) Expense, net . We record certain foreign currency transaction (gains) losses as a component of other (income) expense, net on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Other (income) expense, net of (0.6) million increased by 2.8 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to the impact of favorable foreign currency movements in our Electronics and Stoneridge Brazil segments from strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
 Provision for Income Taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense of 3.0 million was attributable to the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and tax losses for which no benefit is recognized due to valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, offset by U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Summary of Cash Flows: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 28,517 (5,668) Investing activities (18,997) (26,943) Financing activities 4,133 15,534 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (356) (963) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 13,297 (18,040) 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased compared to 2023 primarily due to a reduction in cash used to support working capital levels. Cash provided by receivables was favorable to 2023 as the result of lower sales levels while collection terms remained consistent. Cash provided by inventory improved from the prior year due to the ramp up of product launches occurring in the second half of 2023 and first half of 2024, and the impact of our inventory reduction actions. 
 Net cash used for investing activities decreased compared to 2023 due to lower capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs as well as the 2023 impact of cash proceeds from the sale of equipment. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities decreased compared to 2023 due to a decrease in Credit Facility borrowings net of repayments. 
 As outlined in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, the Credit Facility permits borrowing up to a maximum level of 275.0 million. This variable rate facility has an accordion feature which allows the Company to increase its availability by up to 150.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and lender consent through its expiration in November 2026. The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain less than a maximum leverage ratio and more than a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for credit arrangements of this type including covenants that place restrictions and/or limitations on the Company s ability to borrow money, make capital expenditures and pay dividends. The Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of 196.3 million at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has not experienced a violation that would limit the Company s ability to borrow under the Credit Facility and does not expect that the covenants under it will restrict the Company s financing flexibility. However, it is possible that future borrowing flexibility under the Credit Facility may be limited as a result of lower than expected financial performance due to the adverse impact of significantly lower global demand in our markets and challenging macroeconomic conditions. The Company expects to make additional repayments on the Credit Facility when cash exceeds the amount needed for operations and to remain in compliance with all covenants. 
 The Company s wholly owned subsidiary located in Stockholm, Sweden, has an overdraft credit line that allows overdrafts on the subsidiary s bank account up to a daily maximum level of 20.0 million Swedish krona, or 2.0 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were no borrowings outstanding on this overdraft credit line. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the subsidiary borrowed and repaid 255.1 million Swedish krona, or 25.1 million. 
 The Company s wholly owned subsidiary located in Suzhou, China, had lines of credit that matured in August 2024 and allowed up to a maximum borrowing level of 20.0 million Chinese yuan, or 2.8 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023 there was 2.1 million in borrowings outstanding on the Suzhou credit line. The Suzhou credit line was included on the condensed consolidated balance sheet within current portion of debt. In addition, the Suzhou subsidiary has a bank acceptance draft line of credit which facilitates the extension of trade payable payment terms by 180 days. The bank acceptance draft line of credit allows up to a maximum borrowing level of 60.0 million Chinese yuan, or 8.6 million and 8.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There was 0.0 million and 2.4 million utilized on the Suzhou bank acceptance draft line of credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Suzhou bank acceptance draft line of credit is included on the condensed consolidated balance sheet within accounts payable.

 In December 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to make a 10.0 million investment in Autotech Fund II managed by Autotech, a venture capital firm focused on ground transportation technology. The Company s 10.0 million investment in the Autotech Fund II will be contributed over the expected ten-year life of the fund. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cumulative investment in the Autotech Fund II was 8.7 million. The Company contributed 0.3 million and 0.2 million to Autotech Fund II during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Our future results could also be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have significant foreign denominated transaction exposure in certain locations, especially in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Sweden, Estonia, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and China. Currently, we have foreign currency forward contracts in place for Mexican pesos. See Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. Our future results could also be unfavorably affected by increased commodity prices and material cost inflation as these fluctuations impact the cost of our raw material purchases. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately 54.1 million, of which 79.9 was held in foreign locations. The Company has approximately 78.7 million of undrawn commitments under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, which results in total undrawn commitments and cash balances of more than 132.8 million. However, it is possible that future borrowing flexibility under our Credit Facility may be limited as a result of our financial performance. 
 The principal sources of liquidity available for our future cash requirements are expected to be (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) cash and cash equivalents on hand and (iii) borrowings from our Credit Facility. We believe that our overall liquidity and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures, working capital and other commitments during the next twelve months. While uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment could adversely impact our business, based on our current financial position, we believe it is unlikely that any such effects would preclude us from maintaining sufficient liquidity. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 See Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for disclosures of the Company s commitments and contingencies. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Our Control Devices and Electronics segments are moderately seasonal, impacted by mid-year and year-end shutdowns and the ramp-up of new model production at key customers. In addition, the demand for our Stoneridge Brazil segment consumer products is generally higher in the second half of the year. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Company s critical accounting policies, which include management s best estimates and judgments, are included in Part II, Item 7, to the consolidated financial statements of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K . These accounting policies are considered critical as disclosed in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K because of the potential for a significant impact on the financial statements due to the inherent uncertainty in such estimates. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Information regarding other significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K . 
 
 International Presence 
 By operating internationally, we are affected by foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions of certain countries. Furthermore, given the current economic climate and fluctuations in certain commodity prices, we believe that an increase in such items could significantly affect our profitability. See Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on the Company s foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes to the quantitative and qualitative information about the Company s market risk from those previously presented within Part II, Item 7A of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K .

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in certain legal actions and claims primarily arising in the ordinary course of business. We establish accruals for matters that we believe that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, we do not believe that any of the litigation in which we are currently engaged, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position or results of operations. We are subject to litigation regarding civil, labor, regulatory and other tax contingencies in our Stoneridge Brazil segment that we believe the likelihood of loss is reasonably possible, but not probable, although these claims might take years to resolve. We are also subject to product liability and product warranty claims. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a government-imposed or customer OEM-instituted recall involving such products. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any material losses related to product liability, warranty or recall claims. See additional details of these matters in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

 15.6 Bij schending van dit artikel is de Werknemer aan de Werkgever zonder verwijl, van rechtswege en zonder ingebrekestelling een vergoeding van 15.000 EUR per begane inbreuk verschuldigd, onverminderd het recht van de Werkgever om algehele vergoeding te vorderen van de door hem geleden schade.

 17.4 Dit niet-concurrentiebeding zal zonder uitwerking blijven indien een einde wordt gesteld aan de Arbeidsovereenkomst door de Werknemer wegens dringende reden in hoofde van de Werkgever. 
 17.4 This present non-compete clause will be of no effect if the Employment Contract is terminated by the Employee for gross misconduct of the Employer. 
 17.5 De Werkgever zal gehouden zijn tot het betalen van een forfaitaire vergoeding gelijk aan de helft van de bruto maandloon overeenstemmend met de duur van het niet-concurrentiebeding, in dit geval een vergoeding overeenstemmend met 6 maanden brutoloon, betaald in de loop van de maand volgend op het einde van de huidige Arbeidsovereenkomst. 
 17.5 The Employer will be held to pay a lump-sum indemnity equal to half of the gross salary corresponding to the duration of the non-compete clause, in this case an indemnity corresponding to 6 months gross salary, paid during the month following the end of the present Employment Contract. 
 17.6 In geval van niet nakoming van het niet concurrentiebeding door de Werknemer, zal deze laatste gehouden zijn aan de Werkgever de vergoeding terug te betalen die de Werknemer ontvangen zou hebben en zal de Werknemer daarenboven aan de Werkgever een bedrag dienen te betalen gelijk aan het bedrag van de vergoeding, dit alles onder voorbehoud van de rechten van de Werkgever om de volledige schadevergoeding te vorderen.

 21.1 The Employee is prohibited from sending emails or letters, in whatever form or of whatever nature, be it internally or externally, which could be defamatory for any person or company, which hold insulting, threatening or discriminatory remarks or which publish or disseminate obscene or pornographic materials of whatever nature, other than emails of a 
 
 Page 13 of 16 

pornografisch materiaal inhouden van welke aard ook, andere dan e-mails van hoofdzakelijk persoonlijke aard (die niet aanstootgevend zijn) of andere dan e-mails die vereist zijn voor de goede uitvoering van de taken van de Werknemer. 
 mainly private nature (which are not offensive) or emails which are necessary for the correct execution of the Employees duties. 
 21.2 De Werknemer dient de interne richtlijnen met betrekking tot het gebruik van elektronische briefwisseling en internet binnen de Vennootschap te respecteren.

The Employer therefore assumes that all emails, which are sent via this email system, are of a professional nature. 21.4 Bij geplande afwezigheid, zal de Werknemer de functie afwezigheidsassistent van zijn mailbox instellen. Bij niet-geplande afwezigheid van de Werknemer, zal de hi rarchische overste van de Werknemer de afwezigheidsassistent van de mailbox van de Werknemer instellen. In beide gevallen zal in het automatisch antwoord aan de afzender de hi rarchische overste van de Werknemer worden vermeld als te contacteren persoon. 
 21.4 In case of planned absence, the Employee will activate the out of office assistant of his mailbox.

 Article 23. Applicable Joint Committee 
 De Werkgever ressorteert onder de bevoegdheid van het Paritair Comit nr. 200. The Employer pertains to Joint Committee no. 200. Artikel 24. Gebruik 
 Article 24. Usages 
 Partijen komen overeen dat het gebruik of de gewoonte in hun arbeidsrelatie niet zal gelden als bron van rechten en verplichtingen van de Partijen, en dit ongeacht de vraag of dergelijk gebruik in strijd is of zou kunnen zijn met andere rechtsbronnen die in de arbeidsrelatie van Partijen van toepassing zijn. The Parties agree that the usages or the common practices applied in their employment relationship shall not be considered as a source of any right or obligations with respect to any of the Parties, and this irrespective of the fact that such usages or common practices are contradicting with any other sources of law which govern the employment relationship between the Parties.

 25.2 If any provision of this Employment Contract is declared null and void, the remaining provisions will not be affected thereby. 
 Partijen zullen zich inspannen om de nietige of ongeldige bepaling te vervangen door een geldige bepaling, waarvan de uitwerking zo dicht mogelijk aanleunt bij de beoogde uitwerking van de nietige of ongeldige bepaling. The Parties will endeavour to replace the invalid provision by a valid provision, the effect of which is as close as possible to the intended effect of the invalid provision. 25.3 Onderhavige Arbeidsovereenkomst, alsook alle bijlagen, is onderworpen aan het Belgisch recht. Alleen de Belgische hoven en rechtbanken zijn bevoegd om kennis te nemen van gebeurlijke geschillen tussen Partijen.
