Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operation 

Description of Business 

Neolara Corp. is a development company on start-up
stage, formed to commence operations concerned with turnkey construction of buildings and building materials. We were incorporated under
the laws of the state of Wyoming on June 09, 2022. From our formation we were engaged in the business of namely the development, marketing
and business process analysis, problem solving and general business services by our CEO, sole Officer and Director Mr. Quesada Murillo.
Our executive and business office is located at Contiguo a la Guardia de Asistencia Rural, San Vito, Coto Brus, Puntarenas, 60801, Costa
Rica, and our telephone number is +1 307 269 0177. Our website address is - https://neolara-construction.com/ 

We maintain our statutory registered agent s
office at 30 N Gould St Ste R, Sheridan, WY 82801. 

The Company has only recently commenced operations
as a development-stage company, and it has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term. The Company s
independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

We are a development stage company and currently
have no revenues or significant assets and we have incurred losses since inception. As of September 30, 2024 our total assets were 74,259
and our total current liabilities were 78,500. 

We are providing a useful and effective type of
construction service. Neolara Corp. is a construction and architectural company that provides services including General Contractor, Design
 Consultant, Design Build, Construction Project Management and Turnkey Construction of various types of buildings (private
houses, high-rise buildings, shopping centers, non-residential premises etc.). Our company mainly engages in supplying coconut fiber concrete
and engineering services. We are offering our construction services to the clients in Costa Rica and in the future we are going to spread
our services to other countries. 

We bought a company Futureproof Eco Solutions
LLC because of its unique registration of the patent, the Company Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to the Registration Statement
of 04/18/2023. This patent is about: the invention relates to the production of lightweight concrete based on Portland cement and wood
filler and can be used for the manufacture of building material intended for industrial, agricultural and civil construction. The mixture
consists of Portland cement, wood filler, calcium chloride and water. The mixture also contains sand as a binder additive. Additionally,
to increase the strength of the material, coconut fiber is added to the mixture in an amount of 5 . The achieved technical result is that
the mixture has a compressive strength 1.2-1.5 times greater than standard building mixtures. In addition, the consumption of Portland
cement is reduced by an average of 20 . 

Description of the patent: 

The patent which we have purchased together with
the Company Futureproof Eco Solutions LLC is about: 

Coconut husks are a byproduct of coconut processing,
and coir fiber can be produced cheaply and efficiently anywhere in the world. Since concrete is the most commonly used construction material
in the world, it would certainly be beneficial to find ways to increase its stability and strength. Coir fiber has been shown to be an
effective material for reinforcing concrete, a valuable use for a byproduct of coconut processing. 

13 

Using coir fiber reduces the rate of the depletion
of other natural resources and provides positive economic returns for coconut cultivators. Coir fiber is the toughest of all of the natural
fibers. Rigorous testing has shown that coir fiber-reinforced concrete is stronger than concrete without coir fiber and has improved mechanical
and dynamic properties. 

Coconut fibers mitigate crack development in concrete
structures that are near water or in places where structures are prone to other environmental stresses, such as earthquakes. 

Since coconut fiber is not as dense as concrete,
it reduces the overall weight of a structure, making it ideal for producing a lightweight form of concrete. Coir also has low thermal
conductivity, which allows for natural cooling. oconut fiber has great potential as a replacement for steel as a material for reinforcing
concrete. It is also beneficial because it is strong, cheap to make, and naturally cooling. 

Coir fiber-reinforced concrete has many advantages.
Since coir fiber is a byproduct of coconut processing, it is a readily available substance, and utilizing coir in buildings has positive
cost-benefit implications. 

Coir, as a natural reinforcement material, can
be collected cheaply and efficiently using local labor and technology. With the quest to find affordable housing options for rural and
urban populations around the world still unfinished, developers must start looking at new building methods and incorporating alternative,
innovative measures. Research into coconut fiber suggests that it has significant potential as a durable, low-cost building material. 

Our business intendeds to provide clients with
a convenient and effective construction consulting services via multiple communication channels: phone calls, chat and messenger. Our
Neolara website enables consumers to find the best construction workers for their needs and get real-time professional consultation from
highly experienced builders. 

We are offering such services to our clients: 

turnkey construction 

Turnkey construction is a building solution that
drastically simplifies things for the owner of the future project. With this type of project, the contractor is given the responsibility
for design and construction work. The owner needs only wait for the contractor get the job done, and then when the project is finished,
he or she is able to turn the key and start using the new building or facility. 

We plan to build not only residential but also
commercial real estate: 

Private houses, high-rise buildings, flats, apartments, farm houses - these are the largely sold residential properties. Built amidst the excellent infrastructure and equipped with all modern facilities, each of these properties has its own charm; 

Commercial complexes, warehouses and offices. These properties we plan to construct with modern amenities and spacious interiors to accommodate all goods and office equipment efficiently; 

Retail shopping malls and community centers. We will construct shopping malls and community centers keeping in mind the shopping needs of the consumers these days; 

Staff quarters and hostels; 

Restaurants, hotels, food courts, banquet halls and auditoriums; 

Buildings for hospitals and nursing homes . 

14 

Competition 

 The market of construction and building materials
is highly competitive. Our competitors are substantially larger and more experienced than us and have longer operating histories and have
materially greater financial and other resources than us. 

Marketing 

 We intend to conduct marketing activities in such
ways: 

to embrace social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn). These platforms can help us to build a great referral community to pass on our name and advertise our services by word of mouth via the Internet. 

to create a newsletter. We will use a newsletter to highlight projects we are working on or have completed. Newsletters will be the perfect tool for establishing and maintaining a relationship with our customers. 

to make an impact with video. Creating just one video can provide us with a marketing tool that can be on our website, in our social media posts and emailed out in our newsletter. 

to build a partnership. No building is made up of only one material. Partnerships are essential in the construction business. And, they can be terrific lead builders. We have to work with trusted vendors to build a partnership list. LinkedIn is one of the best platforms for sourcing potential partners. 

to use PPC (pay per click) to bring in qualified leads. PPC, also known as paid advertising, is a highly effective way to get us in front of the right audience and garner more qualified leads. 

to establish a great website (we are planning to add "Construction Calculator" service to our website). 

to place outdoor display advertisements in public transportation terminals, in residential complexes in selected cities, in shopping centers, in construction stores and to rent billboards in Costa Rica. 

intend to cooperate with media platforms and place banner advertisements or advertorials on construction-focused platforms. 

Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings 

 We have never been subject to bankruptcy, receivership
or any similar proceeding. 

Employees; Identification of certain significant
employees 

 We have no employees other than our sole officer
and director, Julio Antonio Quesada Murillo. 

Insurance 

 We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend
to maintain insurance in the future. 

Facilities and Executive Offices 

 Our corporate headquarters is located at Contiguo
a la Guardia de Asistencia Rural, San Vito, Coto Brus, Puntarenas, 60801, Costa Rica and our phone number is +1 307 269 0177. Further,
this space has been provided by our sole executive Mr. Julio Antonio Quesada Murillo free of cost. We consider our current principal office
space arrangement adequate and will reassess our needs based upon the future growth of the company. 

Government and industry regulation 

 We are subject to applicable laws and regulations
that relate directly or indirectly to our operations including United States securities laws. We are required to comply with all regulations,
rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our services in Costa Rica and any other jurisdiction where
we might conduct activities. We believe that government regulation has no material impact on the way we conduct our business. 

15 

Results of Operation 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities.
