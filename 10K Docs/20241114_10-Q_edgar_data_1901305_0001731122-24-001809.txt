FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements, other
than statements of historical facts, contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future
operations, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, are forward-looking
statements. The words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, 
 may, plan, predict, project, target, potential, will, 
 would, could, should, continue and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. 

The forward-looking statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our
perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors we believe are appropriate under
the circumstances. As you read and consider this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees
of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control), and assumptions. Although we believe
that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual
operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking
statements. We believe these factors include, but are not limited to, those described under Risk Factors and Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from
the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements. 

As a result of these and other
factors, we may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should
not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Overview 

We were founded with a mission to inspire the adoption
of sustainable recreational boating by producing stylish electric sport boats designed to offer a cleaner,
quieter, and more efficient alternative to traditional gasoline-powered boats . Until we decided to discontinue and wind down our
business related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing our proprietary outboard electric motor, we had been focused
on the creation, implementation and sale of electric boats utilizing our electric vehicle EV technology to control
and power our boats and proprietary outboard electric motor. In an effort to retain cash and reduce expenditures and as a result of current
market conditions described below, on July 11, 2024, our Board of Directors determined to discontinue and wind down our business related
to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing our proprietary outboard electric motor. On August 12, 2024, we entered into a
Merger Agreement with our parent company, Twin Vee PowerCats Co Twin Vee ). 

We have not completed the
development of our electric boats or electric outboard motor. Three different protypes of the electric boat have been built. We have completed
the design phase of our outboard motor and were in the prototype phase before the decision to wind down operations. 

Industry Trends 

The past year has seen a marked deceleration in the
global demand for recreational marine vehicles, influenced heavily by economic uncertainties and shifting consumer priorities. This slowdown
reflects broader trends affecting the recreational vehicle industries at large, including electric vehicles (EVs). Notably, the global
shift towards EV adoption has been much slower than initially anticipated. Several leading automotive manufacturers have adjusted their
strategies, accordingly, including halting the construction of dedicated EV factories. 

The slower-than-expected adoption rates have led to
cautious consumer spending and investment in EV technology, directly impacting our market. Specifically, the electric boat segment has
experienced even more sluggish growth than the automotive sector. In addition, while Forza s electric boats are still in the development
stage, many of the larger players in the boat industry, such as Mercury Marine, have completed their development efforts and have brought
their electric outboard motors to market. 

These challenges led to the decision to discontinue
and wind down our business related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing our proprietary outboard electric motor and
enter into the Merger Agreement described in more detail below.

Recent Developments 

On
September 10, 2024, we entered into a Separation Agreement with Dan Norton, our President, pursuant to which Mr. Norton and we mutually
agreed to terminate his employment with the Company, effective as of September 30, 2024. Mr. Norton did not advise us of any disagreement
with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices. 

On August 12, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Twin Vee and Twin Vee Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of Twin Vee Twin Vee Merger Sub ), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company will merge with and into Twin Vee Merger Sub, with the Company surviving the merger (the
 Merger ). The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the
effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), each outstanding share of our common stock (other than any shares held
by Twin Vee), will be converted into the right to receive 0.61166627of a share (the Exchange Ratio of Twin Vee common stock,
any fractional shares to be rounded down to the nearest whole share of Twin Vee common stock, for an aggregate of 5,355,000 shares of
Twin Vee common stock. Each outstanding stock option exercisable for shares of our common stock that is outstanding at the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, will be assumed by Twin Vee and converted into a stock option to purchase the number of shares of Twin Vee
common stock that the holder would have received if such holder had exercised such stock option for shares of our common stock prior to
the Merger and exchanged such shares for Twin Vee common stock in accordance with the Exchange Ratio. Each outstanding warrant to purchase
shares of our common stock will be assumed by Twin Vee and converted into a warrant to purchase the number of shares of Twin Vee common
stock that the holder would have received if such holder had exercised such warrant for shares of our common stock prior to the Merger
and exchanged such shares for Twin Vee common stock in accordance with the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment for any reverse stock
split. In addition, at the Effective Time the 7,000,000 shares of our common stock held by Twin Vee will be cancelled. 

The completion of the Merger by each of Twin Vee and the Company
is subject to customary conditions, including (1) (A) adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders (which approval shall include
a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at our annual meeting excluding shares held by us) (the approval of our stockholders
was obtained on November 11, 2024) and (B) approval of the Share Issuance by Twin Vee s shareholders(the approval of the Share Issuance
by Twin Vee s shareholders was obtained on November 11, 2024), (2) authorization for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market of the
shares of Twin Vee s common stock to be issued in the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance, (3) effectiveness of the registration
statement on Form S-4 for Twin Vee s common stock to be issued in the Merger(the registration statement was declared effective on
October 10, 2024), and (4) the absence of any order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the Merger
or making the completion of the Merger illegal. Each party s obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to certain additional
customary conditions, including subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party and
performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Twin
Vee, in its capacity as our principal stockholder, has agreed to vote the shares of our common stock held by it for the approval and adoption
of the Merger only if a majority of our other stockholders present in person or by proxy at the Forza annual meeting vote to approve and
adopt the Merger. 

The
 Merger Agreement
contains certain termination rights for both Twin Vee and us. In addition, either we or Twin Vee may terminate the Merger Agreement if
the Merger is not consummated by December 1, 2024. On November 11, 2024, we held our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual
Meeting ). At the Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved the Merger of the Company with Twin Vee Merger Sub pursuant to the terms
of the Merger Agreement. We believe that all closing conditions will be met and anticipate consummating
the Merger in the near future .

months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 406,515 to 852,451 as compared to 1,258,965 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
Operating expenses include salaries, selling, general, and administrative, research and development, professional fees, and depreciation. 

Research and development costs
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 77,494, as compared to 60,667 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Salaries and wages for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 were 356,650, as compared to 837,857 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and were primarily
related to reductions in staffing in engineering and design. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, salaries and wages included
 174,159 of stock option expense, as compared to 332,107 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Our expenses for selling, general,
and administrative for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 212,753, as compared to 217,455 for the three months ended September

Professional fees for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 were 140,865, as compared to 92,505 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to
merger related expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2024. 

Depreciation and amortization
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 64,689, as compared to 50,482 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, the increase

Other expense and income 

Interest expense was 3,424 and
 1,144, respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Because the proceeds from our
IPO and secondary offering have been partly invested in money market vehicles, those monies earned dividend income. Dividend and interest

Net Sales and Cost of Sales 

Our net sales decreased by 18,559,
or 100 to 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 18,559 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 137,283 due primarily to an asset impairment charge during the second quarter of 1,674,000.
Excluding the impact of this charge, operating expenses decreased by 1,536,717 to 3,380,781 as compared to 4,917,498 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses include salaries, selling, general, and administrative, research and development, professional
fees, and depreciation. 

Research and development costs
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 587,599, as compared to 1,024,787 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our
research and development expenses declined for the quarter, due to large expenditures in 2023 when we were in the early stages of development
of our prototype electric motors and control systems, partially offset by an inventory valuation charge during the first nine months of
2024 of 293,058. 

Salaries and wages for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,479,501, as compared to 2,565,460 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and were primarily
related to reductions in staffing in engineering and design. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 salaries and wages included
 651,115 of stock option expense, as compared to 1,015,087 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Selling, general, and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 737,269, as compared to 906,432 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, as the company began winding down its operations in the third quarter of 2024. 

Professional fees for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 were 391,971, as compared to 286,411 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to merger
related expenses incurred in 2024 

Depreciation and amortization
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 184,441, as compared to 134,408 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase
being attributable to the addition of equipment and tooling. 

Other expense and income 

Interest expense was 7,362 and
 2,928, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Because the proceeds from our
IPO and secondary offering are partly invested in money market vehicles, those monies earn dividend income, interest income, and capital
gains. Dividend and interest income was 339,692 and 413,952, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net
realized gains were 35,210 and 23,747, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

respectively, on December 31, 2023. We have incurred significant costs in pursuit of our construction of our new manufacturing facility
which we have been financing. Our management planned to use the proceeds from the IPO and the secondary offering to finance the expenses
related to the construction of the facility, which we are no longer pursuing. We believe that our current capital resources will be sufficient
to fund our operations while we pursue the Merger and believe that our current capital resources will be sufficient for another 15 months
following the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Inasmuch as we are no longer developing our electric vehicles and have winded
down operation our cash expenditures are expected to be minimal.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated negative cash flows from operating activities of 2,411,753 and 3,877,991, respectively. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of operating losses incurred and a reduction
in accrued liabilities, partially offset by a reduction in inventory since December 31, 2023. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024 net cash provided by investing activities was 96,066 resulting from redemptions of marketable securities more than offsetting
the purchase of property and equipment and building. This compares to a use of cash from investing activities of 10,193,627 in the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 from the purchase of investments in available for sale securities following the company s issuance
of common stock. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 305,417. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided
by financing activities was 6,743,239 resulting primarily from the issuance of common stock. 

Controls and Procedures 

We are now currently required
to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are only required to comply
with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the twelve-month period ending December
31, 2023. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging
growth company, would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. Further,
for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from
various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not
limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

This discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations is based on four financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based
on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, that results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimated under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are
described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe
that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to
the more significant areas involving managements judgements and estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

We recognize revenue when obligations
under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to the dealer. Revenue is measured as the amount
of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. 

Payment received for the future
sale of a boat to a customer is recognized as a customer deposit. Customer deposits are recognized as revenue when control over promised
goods is transferred to the customer. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had customer deposits of 6,175 and 5,700, respectively,
which is recorded as contract liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These deposits are expected to be returned to customers within
a one-year period. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Included in those estimates are assumptions about useful life of fixed assets. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. On September 30, 2024, the Company
had cash and cash equivalents of 7,200,427, and on December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 9,821,531. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are stated
at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated
useful lives of property and equipment range from three to seven years. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
and amortization are eliminated from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations.
Repairs and maintenance expenses, which do not increase the useful lives of the assets, are charged to operations as incurred. 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets 

Management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived
assets when indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing
the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to result from those assets over the remaining life to the assets net carrying amounts.
If the estimated undiscounted net cash flows are less than the net carrying amount, the assets would be adjusted to their fair value,
based on appraisal or the present value of the undiscounted net cash flows. An impairment charge of 1,674,000 was recorded against the
building under construction in the second quarter of 2024 based on a recent third-party appraisal. 

21 

Research and Development 

Research and development costs
are expensed as incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development costs were 77,494 and 60,667,
respectively. Such costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 587,599, as compared to 1,024,787 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Advertising Costs 

Advertising and marketing costs
are expensed as incurred. Such costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0, as compared to 28,146 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Such costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 5,254, as compared to 90,492 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Advertising and marketing costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the accompanying
statements of operations. 

Leases 

We determine if an arrangement
is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement
date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use its incremental
borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We calculate
the associated lease liability and corresponding ROU asset upon lease commencement using a discount rate based on a credit-adjusted secured
borrowing rate commensurate with the term of the lease. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and is reduced
by lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise
that option. Lease expenses for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Income Taxes 

The Company is a C Corporation
under the Internal Revenue Code and a similar section of the state code. 

All income tax amounts
reflect the use of the liability method under accounting for income taxes. Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions
reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes arising primarily from differences between
financial and tax reporting purposes. 

Deferred income taxes, net of
appropriate valuation allowances, are determined using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid. Valuation
allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. When an uncertain
tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit or expense
to recognize in the financial statements. 

In accordance with U.S GAAP,
we follow the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. At September 30, 2024, we do not believe we
have any uncertain tax positions that would require either recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements. 

Our income tax returns are subject
to review and examination by federal, state and local governmental authorities. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

All newly issued accounting pronouncements
not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have during the periods
presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. 

22 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK. 

We are a smaller reporting company
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation
of our interim Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our interim Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer),
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports
filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information
is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 our interim Chief Executive Officer and our interim
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such a date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable
assurance level, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as further described below. 

Previously Reported Material Weakness 

As disclosed in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting relating to a lack of segregation of duties. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in our internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our condensed financial statements
would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. These deficiencies could result in additional misstatements to our condensed financial
statements that would be material and would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Remediation Plan 

Management had developed and
is executing a remediation plan to address the previously disclosed material weaknesses and had planned to hire additional full-time accounting
expertise and the utilize outside advisors where appropriate. However, due to the decisions to wind down our business related to the development
and sale of electric boats utilizing our proprietary outboard electric motor and our entry into the Merger Agreement we have not implemented
the remediation plan 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other than as discussed above,
there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

23 

PART II OTHER
INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, we may become
involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to
any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us
because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Investing in our securities involves
a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks and the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023, together with all the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed
financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating results, financial condition
and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information
disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

There is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. 

The report of our independent
registered public accounting firm contains a note stating that the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will
continue as a going concern. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred a net loss of 4,895,093 and 4,535,100,
respectively and used cash in operations of 2,428,683 and 3,877,991, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred
a net loss of 5,933,113 and used cash in operations of 4,150,280. Losses have principally occurred as the result of our research and
development efforts coupled with a lack of operating revenue. Until we begin generating revenue, there is doubt about our ability to become
a going concern in the future. Inasmuch as we have ceased our business related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing
our proprietary outboard electric motor, which was our only business operations, we do not anticipate generating revenue in the future. 

Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital
Market has resulted in the suspension of trading of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market . 

Our shares of common stock have been suspended from trading on The Nasdaq Capital
Market. The Company s common stock currently trades on the OTC Markets system under the trading symbol FRZA . This
suspension is likely to have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and may impair the ability of our stockholders to sell
or purchase our common stock when they wish to do so. 

24 

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal
statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. 
Because our common stock is no longer traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market, shares of our common stock are no longer recognized as covered
securities and we will be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 

If the Merger is not consummated, we may seek other business opportunities
and need to raise additional capital, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. 

On July 11, 2024, in an effort
to retain cash and reduce expenditures and as a result of current market conditions, our Board of Directors determined to discontinue
and wind down our business related to the development and sale of electric boats utilizing our proprietary outboard electric motor. As
a result, we currently do not have an operating business. If the Merger is not consummated, we may seek other business opportunities and
identifying, acquiring and operating any such new business venture is expected to require significant cash outlays and advance capital
expenditures and commitments. If cash on hand and cash generated from our initial public offering and subsequent follow-on offering are
not sufficient to meet our future cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financings,
to fund our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. Financing may be
on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase
our securities may be lower than the price per share of our common stock paid by existing holders. The holders of new securities may also
have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If new sources of financing are
required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding,
if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. 

We have identified
weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional
material weaknesses will not occur in the future. 

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations continue to increase our
legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant
strain on our personnel, systems and resources. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things,
that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting. 

As of September 30, 2024, we do not yet have effective
disclosure controls and procedures, or internal controls over all aspects of our financial reporting. We have ceased our remediation plan
upon entering into the Merger Agreement. We cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable
us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. 

Our current controls and any new controls that we
develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, including increased complexity resulting from our international
expansion. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future.
Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm
our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements
for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect
the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting
that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls
and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. 

25 

Our independent registered public accounting firm
is not required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an emerging
growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that
is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed
or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material
and adverse effect on our business and operating results and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. 

The Exchange Ratio in the Merger Agreement is
not adjustable based on the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock so the Merger consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser
value than it had at the time the Merger Agreement was signed. 

The parties to the Merger Agreement have set the Exchange
Ratio for our common stock and the Exchange Ratio is not adjustable. Any changes in the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock or our common
stock will not affect the number of shares holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive upon consummation of the Merger. Therefore,
if the market price of Twin Vee Common Stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation
of the Merger, Forza stockholders could receive Merger consideration with considerably less value. Similarly, if the market price of Twin
Vee Common Stock increases from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation of the Merger, our stockholders
could receive Merger consideration with considerably more value than their shares of our common stock and the Twin Vee stockholders immediately
prior to the Merger will not be compensated for the increased market value of the Twin Vee Common Stock. If the market price of our common
stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation of the Merger, our stockholders could
receive Merger consideration with considerably more value. Similarly, if the market price of our common stock increases from the market
price on the date of the Merger Agreement prior to the consummation of the Merger, our stockholders could receive Merger consideration
with considerably less value than their shares of our common stock and our stockholders immediately prior to the Merger will not be compensated
for the increased market value of our common stock. The Merger Agreement does not include a price-based termination right and the Exchange
Ratio does not adjust as a result of changes in the value of Twin Vee Common Stock. 

The Merger may be completed even though
material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Merger, industry-wide changes and other causes. 

In general, either Twin Vee
or we can refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between August 12, 2024, the date
of the Merger Agreement, and the closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Merger,
even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Twin Vee or us, including: 

general business or economic conditions affecting the industries in which Twin Vee or we operate; 

acts of war, armed hostilities or terrorism; 

changes in financial, banking or securities markets; 

the taking of any action required to be taken by the Merger Agreement; 

with respect either party, the announcement or pendency of the Merger Agreement or any related transactions; or 

with respect to either party, any change in their or the other party s stock price or trading volume stock. 

If adverse changes occur and still complete the
Merger, the combined company stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Merger to the stockholders of Twin Vee and
us. 

26 

The combined company s stock price is
expected to be volatile, and the market price of its common stock may drop following the Merger. 

The market price of the combined company s common
stock could be subject to significant fluctuations following the Merger especially when the shareholder base is increased. Moreover, the
stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual
companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of the combined company s common stock. 

In the past, following periods of volatility in the
market price of a company s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies.
Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly
harm the combined company s profitability and reputation. 

The market price of the combined company s
common stock may decline as a result of the Merger. 

The market price of the combined company s common
stock may decline as a result of the Merger if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or
to the extent anticipated by Twin Vee or us or investors, financial or industry analysts. 

The combined company may not experience the
anticipated strategic benefits of the Merger. 

The respective managements of Twin Vee and us believe
that the Merger would provide certain strategic benefits that may not be realized by each of the companies operating as standalones. Specifically,
Twin Vee believes the Merger would enable the combined companies to take advantage of approximately 700,000 in annual cost savings.
There can be no assurance that these anticipated benefits of the Merger will materialize or that if they materialize will result in increased
stockholder value or revenue stream to the combined company. 

Twin Vee and Forza stockholders may
not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger. 

If the combined company is unable to realize the
full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, Twin Vee and our securityholders will have experienced substantial
dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part
of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently
anticipated from the Merger. 

If the conditions to the Merger are not met,
the Merger will not occur. 

Even if the Merger is approved by the stockholders
of Twin Vee and us, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived in order to complete the Merger, including, among others: 

the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection with the issuance of Twin Vee Common Stock in the Merger; 

the respective representations and warranties of
 Twin Vee and us, shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and the
 closing; 

no material adverse effect with respect to Twin
 Vee or us shall have occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger; 

performance or compliance in all material respects by Twin Vee and us with their and our respective covenants and obligations in the Merger Agreement; 

We and Twin Vee shall have obtained any consents
 and waivers of approvals required in connection with the Merger, including for Twin Vee approval of its stockholders of the issuance
 of the Twin Vee Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and for us approval of our stockholders of the Merger and
 the Merger Agreement; and 

no material adverse effect with respect to Twin Vee or us s shall have occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement. 

27 

These and other conditions are described in detail
in the Merger Agreement. We and Twin Vee cannot assure investors that all of the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied. If the conditions
to the Merger are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not occur or will be delayed, and we and Twin Vee each may lose some or all
of the intended benefits of the Merger. 

Twin Vee and Forza will incur substantial expenses
whether or not the Merger is completed. 

Twin Vee and Forza have each incurred and will incur
substantial expenses related to the Merger whether or not the Merger is completed. Twin Vee currently expects to incur approximately 400,000
in transactional expenses and wea currently expect to incur approximately 100,000 in transactional expenses. 

During the pendency of the Merger, we and Twin
Vee may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the Merger
Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective businesses. 

Covenants in the Merger Agreement
impede the ability of Twin Vee and us to make acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, or complete other
transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending the closing of the merger. As a result, if the Merger is not completed,
the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during that period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect,
each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such
as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business, with any third-party, subject to certain
exceptions. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party s stockholders. 

Certain provisions
of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior
to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

The terms of the Merger Agreement
prohibit each of Twin Vee and us from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover
proposals, except in certain circumstances where the Twin Vee Board of Directors or our Board of Directors, as applicable, determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a superior takeover proposal and that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of our Board of Directors. 

Should the Merger not qualify as a tax-free
reorganization, our stockholders may recognize capital gain or loss with respect to the shares of Twin vee common stock received in the
Merger. 

The Merger is expected to be treated as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, however, neither Twin Vee nor Forza has received an Internal Revenue Services ruling to
that effect. The failure of the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code would result in a
Forza stockholder recognizing capital gain or loss with respect to the shares of Forza Common Stock surrendered for Twin Vee Common Stock
received in the Merger.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

(a) 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. 

None. 

(b) 
 Use of Proceeds. 

On August 16, 2022, we closed
our initial public offering of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 5.00 per share and an additional 450,000
shares of common stock upon exercise of the over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of 17,250,000 (the IPO pursuant
to our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (as amended) (File No. 333-261884), which was declared effective by the SEC on August 11, 2022.
After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 1.3 million, and other offering expenses payable by us of approximately
 1.3 million, we received approximately 14.7 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering. ThinkEquity LLC acted as the representative
of the several underwriters for the offering. 

The planned use
of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus, dated August 11, 2022, which was filed with the SEC
on August 15, 2022, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act was expected as follows: (i) approximately 8.0 million for the acquisition
of property and the development of a manufacturing plant to build, design and manufacture our new line of electric boats; (ii) approximately
 2.0 million for ramp up of production and inventory; (iii) approximately 2.6 million for working capital. Since we have effectively
wound down our research and development efforts, and further as a result of the planned merger with Twin Vee, we no longer expect to deploy
these proceeds towards these efforts. 

No payments were made by us to
directors, officers or persons owning ten percent or more of our common stock or to their associates, or to our affiliates, other than
payments in the ordinary course of business to officers for salaries. Pending the uses described, we have invested the net proceeds in
our operating cash account. 

(c) 
 Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities. 

None. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES. 

Not Applicable. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. 

Not Applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading
arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
