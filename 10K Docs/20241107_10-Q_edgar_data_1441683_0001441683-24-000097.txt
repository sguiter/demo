as sales commissions on initial sales are not commensurate with sales commissions on contract renewals. Commissions paid relating to contract renewals are deferred and amortized over the related renewal period. We determine the estimated economic life based on both qualitative and quantitative factors such as expected renewals, product life cycles, contractual terms, and customer attrition. We periodically review the carrying amount of deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the estimated economic life. Costs to obtain a contract for professional services arrangements are expensed as incurred as the contractual period of our professional services arrangements are one year or less.

 Lease Impairment Charges 
 
 In connection with the headcount reductions approved in June 2024, and our continued efforts to streamline operations and maximize efficiencies, we have initiated supplemental actions to reduce the footprint of our leased office spaces. Pursuant to these initiatives, we have amended and extended the terms of our existing sublease agreement and are seeking a sublease for an additional floor within our corporate headquarters facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded non-cash lease impairment charges of million within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations related to the ROU assets. impairment charges were incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The non-cash lease impairment charges represent the amount the carrying value of the asset groups exceeded their estimated fair values. The asset groups represented separate floors within our corporate headquarters facility. The fair values of the asset groups were measured using discounted cash flow models based on market rents and sublease incomes projected over the remaining lease terms.

term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of million and, in addition, up to million for a revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of million and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of million (as a sublimit of the revolving loan facility). The Credit Agreement matures on November 3, 2027. We have been using the proceeds to fund the growth of our business and support our working capital requirements. 
 
 Under the agreement, we may elect whether amounts drawn bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate per annum equal to either (a) the higher of the Prime rate or the Federal Funds Effective rate Base Rate plus or (b) the forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate Term SOFR ). An additional interest rate margin is added to the elected interest rates. During the first three years of the Credit Agreement, the additional interest rate margin ranges from to in the case of Base Rate advances or from to in the case of Term SOFR advances, depending on our debt to recurring revenue leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). During the final two years of the Credit Agreement, the interest rate margin ranges from to in the case of Base Rate advances and from to in the case of Term SOFR advances, depending on our debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). 
 
 In addition, the Credit Agreement contains other customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants by us limiting additional indebtedness, guarantees, liens, fundamental changes, mergers and consolidations, dispositions of assets, investments, paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming, repurchasing, or retiring capital stock, prepaying certain junior indebtedness and preferred stock, certain corporate changes, and transactions with affiliates.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the actual effective tax rates were ) and ) , respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net unrecognized tax benefits totaled million, which if recognized would result in no net effect on the effective tax rate due to a valuation allowance. The amount of reasonably possible unrecognized tax benefits that could decrease over the next 12 months due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations or settlements of tax audits is not material to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. Due to our net operating loss carryforwards, the tax years 2016 through 2023 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. There are no open examinations that would have a meaningful impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 Exclusive of the AWS contract, we have other non-cancellable agreements for subscription software products that contain provisions stipulating minimum purchase commitments. However, the annual purchase commitments under these contracts are, individually and in the aggregate, immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Pegasystems Litigation 
 
 On May 29, 2020, we filed a civil complaint against Pegasystems, Inc. Pegasystems and Youyong Zou, a Virginia resident, in the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, Virginia. Appian Corp v. Pegasystems Inc. Youyong Zou, No. 2020-07216 (Fairfax Cty. Ct.). On May 10, 2022, we announced the jury awarded us billion in damages for misappropriation of our trade secrets and in damages for violating the Virginia Computer Crimes Act. Pegasystems filed several post-trial motions seeking relief in the form of reducing the damages award or setting aside the jury s verdict and either granting a new trial or entering judgment in Pegasystems favor. All of these motions were denied, and final judgment was entered by the Court on September 15, 2022. The final judgment reaffirmed the billion in damages and also ordered Pegasystems to pay Appian million in attorney's fees associated with the case as well as statutory post-judgment interest on the judgment at an annual rate of , or approximately million per year. 
 
 Defendant Youyong Zou has satisfied the judgment of (plus interest) against him in lieu of appealing that judgment. On September 15, 2022, Pegasystems filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals of Virginia. On July 30, 2024, the Court of Appeals of Virginia issued a decision reversing the judgment against Pegasystems and remanding for a new trial. The decision rejected Pegasystems argument that Appian had not presented evidence that trade secrets were misappropriated but reversed the judgment on the basis of evidentiary and damages rulings made by the trial court. On August 29, 2024, Appian submitted a petition to the Supreme Court of Virginia seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals decision and reinstate the full judgment against Pegasystems. Pegasystems filed an opposition to the petition and cross-issues for appeal on October 21, 2024. The timeline to hear Appian s petition is in the control of the Supreme Court. 
 
 We cannot predict the outcome of any appeals or the exact time it will take to resolve them. 
 
 Judgment Preservation Insurance 
 
 On September 1, 2023, we entered into a Judgment Preservation Insurance JPI policy in connection with our billion judgment against Pegasystems. The total cost of the policy was million and is comprised of the premium, a one-time broker fee, and Virginia lines tax. The policy provides up to million of coverage. 
 
 The total cost of the policy was capitalized and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated length of the appeals process. We currently estimate the total length of the appeals process (solely for amortization purposes) to be approximately . This estimate is reviewed each reporting period. Amortization expense associated with the JPI premium is recorded to general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. JPI amortization expense was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. JPI amortization expense was million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, million of the unamortized balance is classified as Prepaid expenses and other current assets while the remaining million is classified as 'Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

As of September 30, 2024, shareholders equity included million shares outstanding, net of million shares of common stock held in treasury.

 With respect to geographic information, revenue is attributed to respective geographies based on the contracting address of the customer. The value of our long-lived assets, which are comprised of property and equipment, intangible assets with finite lives, and right-of-use assets, held in the United States and internationally as of September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our long-lived assets held in the United States and internationally were million and million, respectively.

The carrying amounts of our accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 because of the relatively short duration of these instruments. Additionally, the carrying value of our debt associated with the term loan facility approximates fair value because the interest rates are variable and reset on relatively short durations to the then market rates.

 The contractual maturities of our debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were all one year or less. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.

Overview 
 
 Appian is a software company that orchestrates business processes. The Appian Platform empowers leaders to design, automate, and optimize important processes from start to finish. With our industry-leading platform and commitment to customer success, Appian is trusted by top organizations to drive transformational process change. 
 
 We have generated the majority of our revenue from sales of subscriptions, which include (1) cloud subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. Our subscription contracts are priced based primarily on the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform or, alternatively, non-user-based single application licenses. Our subscription contract terms generally vary from one to three years with most providing for payment in advance on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis. Due to the variability of our billing terms and the episodic nature of our customers purchasing additional subscriptions, we do not believe changes in our deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth. 
 
 We have invested in our Customer Success organization to help ensure customers are able to build and deploy applications on our platform. We have several strategic partnerships, including with Accenture, Capgemini, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC, and TCS, which allow them to refer customers to us in order to purchase subscriptions. Our partners then provide professional services directly to the customers using our platform. We intend to continue focusing on adding new customers with our strategic partners. In addition, over time we expect our professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline as we increasingly rely on strategic partners to help our customers deploy our software. We believe our investment in professional services, including strategic partners building their practices around Appian, will drive increased adoption of our platform. 
 
 Our customers primarily include financial services, government, life sciences, insurance, manufacturing, energy, healthcare, telecommunications, and transportation organizations. Generally, our sales team targets its efforts to organizations with over 2,000 employees and 2 billion in annual revenue. Revenue from U.S. federal government 
 27 

agencies represented 23.2 and 22.5 of our total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Revenue from U.S. federal government agencies represented 21.1 and 20.6 of our total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. No single end-customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 
 We offer our platform globally. Our platform supports multiple languages to facilitate collaboration and address challenges in multinational organizations. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 36.3 and 37.2 , respectively, of our total revenue was generated from customers outside of the United States as compared to 35.3 and 35.6 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we operated in 16 countries. We believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our international footprint, and we are investing in new geographies, including through investment in direct and indirect sales channels, professional services, and customer support and implementation partners. 
 
 Our business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of customer relationships, which is a function of the duration of a customer s deployment of our platform as well as the price and number of subscriptions of our platform that a customer purchases. We incur significant customer acquisition costs, including expenses associated with hiring new sales representatives, who can take anywhere from six months to a year to become productive given the length of our sales cycle, and marketing costs which, with the exception of certain types of sales commissions, are expensed as incurred. 

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 The following are several key factors that affect our performance: 
 
 Market Adoption of Our Platform - Our ability to grow our customer base and drive market adoption of our platform is affected by the pace at which organizations digitally transform. We expect our revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our platform. We offer a leading custom software platform and intend to continue to invest to expand our customer base. The degree to which prospective customers recognize the need for our software platform and its ability to enable their organizations to digitally transform, and subsequently allocate budget dollars to purchase our software, will drive our ability to acquire new customers and increase sales to existing customers, which, in turn, will affect our future financial performance. 
 
 Growth of Our Customer Base - We believe we have a substantial opportunity to grow our customer base. We have aggressively invested, and intend to continue to invest, in our sales team in order to drive sales to new customers. We continue to make investments to enhance the expertise of our sales and marketing organization within our key industry verticals of financial services, government, life sciences, insurance, and manufacturing. In addition, we have established relationships with strategic partners who work with organizations undergoing digital transformations. Our ability to continue to grow our customer base is dependent, in part, upon our ability to differentiate ourselves within the increasingly competitive markets in which we participate. 
 
 Further Penetration of Existing Customers - Our sales team seeks to generate additional revenue from existing customers by adding new users to our platform. Many of our customers begin by building a single application and then grow to build dozens of applications on our platform. Generally, the development of new applications on our platform results in the expansion of our user base within an organization and a corresponding increase in revenue. As a result of this land and expand strategy, we have generated significant additional revenue from our customer base. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including the size of our sales and professional services teams, customers level of satisfaction with our platform and professional services, pricing, economic conditions, and our customers overall spending levels. Some of our professional services personnel are customer success managers. Their role is to ensure customers realize value from our platform and support strategic partners and the land and expand strategy versus delivering billable hours. 
 
 28 

Mix of Subscriptions and Professional Services Revenue - We believe our professional services have driven customer success and facilitated the adoption of our platform by customers. During the initial period of deployment of our platform by a customer, we generally provide a greater amount of support in building applications and training than later in the deployment, with a typical engagement lasting from two to six months. At the same time, many of our customers have historically purchased subscriptions for only a limited set of their total potential end users. As a result of these factors, the proportion of total revenue for a customer associated with professional services is relatively high during the initial deployment period. Over time, as the need for professional services associated with user deployments decreases and the number of end users increases, we expect subscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenue to increase. In addition, we continue to grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. These partners perform professional services with respect to any new service contracts they originate. As the usage of strategic partners expands, we expect the proportion of our total revenue from subscriptions to increase over time relative to professional services. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 79.9 and 75.7 of our revenue, respectively, was derived from sales of subscriptions while the remaining 20.1 and 24.3 , respectively, was derived from the sale of professional services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 78.6 and 74.1 of our revenue, respectively, was subscriptions-based while the remaining 21.4 and 25.9 , respectively, was related to professional services. 
 
 Investments in Growth - We have made, and plan to continue to make, investments for long-term growth, including investing in our platform and infrastructure to continuously maximize their power and speed, meet the evolving needs of our customers, and take advantage of our market opportunity. In addition, we may pursue strategic acquisitions that enhance our product offerings. We also intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing as we further expand our sales teams, increase our marketing activities, and grow our international operations. 

Key Metrics 
 
 We monitor the following metrics to help us measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our operations. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands. 
 
 Cloud Subscriptions Revenue 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Cloud subscriptions revenue 
 94,075 77,247 21.8 269,106 221,381 21.6 
 
 Cloud subscriptions revenue includes cloud subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services. Our cloud subscriptions revenue for any customer is primarily determined by the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform or by the number of application licenses purchased, as well as the price paid. We believe increasing cloud subscriptions revenue is an indicator of the demand for our platform, the pace at which the market for our solutions is growing, the productivity of our sales team and strategic relationships in growing our customer base, and our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base. 
 
 Cloud Subscriptions Revenue Retention Rate 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Cloud subscriptions revenue retention rate 
 117 117 
 
 A key factor to our success is the renewal and expansion of subscription agreements with our existing customers. We calculate this metric over a set of customers who have been with us for at least one full year. To calculate our cloud subscriptions revenue retention rate for a particular trailing 12-month period, we first establish the recurring cloud subscriptions revenue for the previous trailing 12-month period. This effectively represents 
 29 

recurring dollars we should expect in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period without accounting for any expansion or contraction. We subsequently measure the recurring cloud subscriptions revenue in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period. Cloud subscriptions revenue retention rate is then calculated by dividing the aggregate recurring cloud subscriptions revenue in the current trailing 12-month period by the previous trailing 12-month period. This calculation includes the combined impact on our revenue from customer non-renewals, pricing changes, and growth in the number of users on our platform. Our cloud subscriptions revenue retention rate can fluctuate from period to period due to large customer contracts in any given period. 

Key Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 We generate revenue primarily through sales of subscriptions to our platform as well as professional services. We typically sell our software on a per-user basis or through non-user-based single application licenses. We generally bill customers and collect payment for subscriptions to our platform in advance on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis. In certain instances, we have had customers pay their entire contract value up front. 
 
 Our revenue is comprised of the following: 
 
 Subscriptions 
 
 Subscriptions revenue is primarily derived from cloud subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services and on-premises term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. Our maintenance and support agreements provide customers with the right to unspecified software upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the maintenance and support agreement on a when-and-if-available basis, and rights to technical support. On-premises term license subscriptions are offered when the customer prefers to self-manage the deployment of our platform within their own infrastructure. When our platform is delivered as a cloud subscription, we manage operational needs in third-party hosted data centers. 
 
 Professional Services 
 
 Our professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services, including application development, deployment assistance, and training related to our platform. Over time, we expect professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decrease as the usage of our partner network expands. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 
 Subscriptions 
 
 Cost of subscriptions revenue consists primarily of fees paid to our third-party managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, personnel costs, including payroll and benefits for our technology operations and customer support teams, amortization of acquired technology, and allocated overhead costs. We expect cost of revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as our customer base grows. 
 
 Professional Services 
 
 Cost of professional services revenue includes all direct and indirect costs to deliver our professional services and training, including employee compensation for our global professional services and training personnel, third-party contractor costs, allocated overhead costs, and the costs of billable expenses such as travel and lodging. The unpredictability of the timing of providing services related to significant professional services agreements sold on a standalone basis may cause significant fluctuations in our cost of professional services which, in turn, may impact our quarterly financial results. 
 
 30 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 
 Gross profit and gross margin (defined as gross profit as a percentage of total revenue), have been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including the mix of cloud subscriptions and on-premises term license subscriptions, the mix of total subscriptions revenue and professional services revenue, subscription pricing, the costs associated with third-party hosting providers, and the extent to which we expand or reduce our professional services to support future changes in our growth. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the above factors. 
 
 Subscriptions Gross Margin 
 
 Subscriptions gross margin is primarily affected by the growth in our subscriptions revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, costs to support such revenue. We expect to continue to invest in customer support and cloud operations to support growth in our business, and the timing of those investments is expected to cause subscriptions gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Professional Services Gross Margin 
 
 Professional services gross margin is affected by the growth in our professional services revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, the costs of our Customer Success organization as we continue to invest in the growth of our business, as well as by consultant utilization rates. Professional services gross margin is also impacted by the amount of services performed by subcontractors and partners as opposed to internal resources. In 2024, we expect professional services gross margin to be slightly lower than in 2023; however, the margin remains subject to fluctuation based on the factors discussed above. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel-related costs such as salaries, bonuses, commissions, payroll tax payments, and stock-based compensation expense are the most significant components of each of these expense categories. Other components of each category include professional fees for third-party services such as legal, software development resources, contractors, and cloud computing services. In addition, operating expenses include allocated overhead costs, which are primarily comprised of facility costs such as rent, employee medical benefits, employee relations expense, and certain information technology costs. 
 
 In general, our operating expenses are expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we invest resources in growing our various teams although at a more measured rate than prior years. 
 
 Sales and Marketing Expense 
 
 Sales and marketing expense primarily includes personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, and other personnel costs related to sales teams. Additional major expenses in this category include travel and entertainment, marketing activities and promotional events, subcontracting fees, and allocated overhead costs. 
 
 In order to continue to grow our business, geographical footprint, and brand awareness, we expect to continue investing resources in sales and marketing in our principal markets and strategic growth areas. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest to acquire new customers and further expand usage of our platform within our existing customer base. We will continue our efforts to build on our brand reputation and increase market awareness of our platform. 
 
 31 

Research and Development Expense 
 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our employees who develop and enhance our platform, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other personnel costs. Also included are non-personnel costs such as subcontracting, consulting, professional fees to third party development resources, certain information technology expenses, and allocated overhead costs. 
 
 Our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the capabilities, speed, and power of our software platform. In 2022, we opened a new product development center in India. Although we expect research and development expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as such costs are critical to maintain and improve the quality of applications and our competitive position, we believe our product development center will result in cost savings over time. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other personnel costs for our administrative, legal, information technology, human resources, finance, and accounting teams as well as our senior executives. Additional expenses included in this category are non-personnel costs such as travel-related expenses, contracting and professional fees for such services as audits, taxation, and legal, insurance and other corporate expenses, including allocated overhead costs, and bad debt expenses. In 2024, we expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars largely due to amortization expense associated with the judgment preservation insurance policy (as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements), lease impairments (as discussed in Note 4), and investments in our information technology team. 
 
 Other Non-Operating Expense 
 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 
 Other expense (income), net consists primarily of gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments, and other sources of income or expense not related to our core business operations. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our debt, amortization of deferred financing fees, unused credit facility fees, and commitment fees on our letters of credit.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Revenue 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Revenue Subscriptions 123,121 103,803 19,318 18.6 Professional services 30,931 33,291 (2,360) (7.1) Total revenue 154,052 137,094 16,958 12.4 
 
 Total revenue increased 17.0 million, or 12.4 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to an increase in our subscriptions revenue of 19.3 million. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our professional services revenue of 2.4 million. The increase in subscriptions revenue was driven by a 16.8 million increase in cloud subscription revenue, a 1.3 million increase in maintenance and support revenue, and a 1.2 million increase in on-premises subscription revenue. With respect to new versus existing customers, there was a 5.6 million increase in subscriptions revenue from sales to new customers, while the 
 34 

remaining 13.7 million of the increase was attributable to expanded deployments, price increases on renewals, and corresponding sales of additional subscriptions to existing customers. The decrease in professional services revenue was due primarily to a 8.4 million decrease in revenue from existing customers, which was partially offset by a 6.1 million increase in sales to new customers. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue Subscriptions 14,082 11,265 2,817 25.0 Professional services 23,002 24,804 (1,802) (7.3) Total cost of revenue 37,084 36,069 1,015 2.8 Subscriptions gross margin 88.6 89.1 Professional services gross margin 25.6 25.5 Total gross margin 75.9 73.7 
 
 Cost of revenue increased 1.0 million, or 2.8 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 2.5 million increase in hosting costs. This increase was partially offset by a 0.5 million decrease in contractor costs, a 0.3 million decrease in professional services and product support personnel costs, and a 0.1 million decrease in employee relations costs. Hosting costs increased due to an increase in sales of our cloud offering during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Contractor costs decreased due to a decrease in the usage of subcontractors for professional services engagements. Professional services and product support personnel costs decreased due to a decrease in cost of sales headcount of 9 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 as well as a 0.2 million decrease in stock compensation expense. 
 
 Subscriptions gross margin decreased slightly to 88.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 89.1 in the same period in 2023. The decrease in subscriptions gross margin was attributable to an increase in hosting costs, which was substantially offset by an increase in subscriptions revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Professional services gross margin increased slightly to 25.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.5 in the same period in 2023 due largely to a decrease in professional services expense as described above, which was offset by a decrease in professional services revenue in the comparable period. Gross margin increased to 75.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 73.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven largely by the increase in subscriptions revenue. 
 
 Sales and Marketing Expense 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing 50,865 55,667 (4,802) (8.6) of revenue 33.0 40.6 
 
 Sales and marketing expense decreased 4.8 million, or 8.6 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 5.0 million decrease in sales and marketing personnel costs. This decrease was partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in marketing costs and a 0.4 million increase travel and entertainment costs. Sales and marketing personnel costs decreased due to a decrease in sales and marketing headcount of 21 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and a 1.5 million decrease in stock 
 35 

compensation expense. Marketing costs increased primarily due to higher spending on various marketing events and public relations. Travel and entertainment expense increased due to a higher number of in-person events and engagements relative to the prior year. 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Research and development 38,572 37,135 1,437 3.9 of revenue 25.0 27.1 
 
 Research and development expense increased 1.4 million, or 3.9 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 0.9 million increase in research and development personnel costs, a 0.4 million increase in cloud computing expense, and a 0.3 million increase in employee medical benefits. Wages, salaries, and medical benefits were all higher due to research and development personnel headcount increasing 5 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, while cloud computing expense increased due to increased spending on cloud migrations. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) General and administrative 
 34,688 23,440 11,248 48.0 of revenue 22.5 17.1 
 
 General and administrative expense increased 11.2 million, or 48.0 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increases of 7.7 million in professional fees and 1.6 million in insurance expense. These increases were partially offset by a 0.9 million decrease in personnel costs. Higher professional fees were driven by an increase in legal fees incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior year along with a 5.7 million decrease in insurance reimbursements associated with our litigation against Pegasystems as a result of receiving reimbursements in the prior year compared to none in the current year. The increase in insurance expense was driven by the continued amortization of our judgment preservation insurance policy, which was entered into on September 1, 2023. Personnel costs were lower due to general and administrative personnel headcount decreasing by 6 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024.

 Other income, net was 12.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other expense, net of 1.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily due to 
 36 

9.2 million in foreign exchange gains in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.3 million in foreign exchange losses in the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, there was a 1.8 million increase in other income related to short-swing profit disgorgement payments to us from a public stockholder of our Class A common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by a 0.9 million decrease in interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior year.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Interest expense 6,168 4,917 1,251 25.4 of revenue 4.0 3.6 
 
 Interest expense increased by 1.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to interest expense incurred on additional credit facility borrowings that we entered into during the first quarter of 2024.

 Indicates a percentage that is not meaningful. 
 
 Income tax expense increased by 1.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by increased pre-tax book income in our certain international subsidiaries for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in pre-tax book income was primarily attributable to fluctuations in non-operating unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Revenue 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Revenue Subscriptions 353,789 296,554 57,235 19.3 Professional services 96,548 103,490 (6,942) (6.7) Total revenue 450,337 400,044 50,293 12.6 
 
 Total revenue increased 50.3 million, or 12.6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to an increase in our subscriptions revenue of 57.2 million. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our professional services revenue of 6.9 million. The increase in subscriptions revenue was driven by a 47.7 million increase in cloud subscription revenue, a 6.1 million increase in on-premises subscription 
 37 

revenue, and a 3.4 million increase in maintenance and support revenue. With respect to new versus existing customers, there was a 15.0 million increase in subscriptions revenue from sales to new customers, while the remaining 42.2 million of the increase was attributable to expanded deployments, price increases on renewals, and corresponding sales of additional subscriptions to existing customers. The decrease in professional services revenue was due primarily to a 20.8 million decrease in revenue from existing customers, which was partially offset by a 13.8 million increase in sales to new customers. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue Subscriptions 39,614 32,492 7,122 21.9 Professional services 74,880 76,515 (1,635) (2.1) Total cost of revenue 114,494 109,007 5,487 5.0 Subscriptions gross margin 88.8 89.0 Professional services gross margin 22.4 26.1 Total gross margin 74.6 72.8 
 
 Cost of revenue increased 5.5 million, or 5.0 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 6.3 million increase in hosting costs and a 1.4 million increase in professional services and product support personnel costs. These increases were partially offset by a 1.7 million decrease in contractor costs and a 0.2 million decrease in travel expense. Hosting costs increased due to an increase in sales of our cloud offering during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Although cost of sales headcount fell 9 year over year, personnel costs increased due to a 1.2 million increase in severance expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Contractor costs decreased due to a decrease in the usage of subcontractors for professional services engagements. 
 
 Subscriptions gross margin decreased slightly to 88.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 89.0 in the same period in 2023. The decrease in subscriptions gross margin was attributable to increased hosting costs, which were substantially offset by an increase in subscriptions revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Professional services gross margin decreased to 22.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.1 in the same period in 2023 due largely to a decrease in professional services revenue in the comparable periods, partially offset by a decrease in professional services expenses. Gross margin increased to 74.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 72.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven largely by the increase in subscriptions revenue. 
 
 Sales and Marketing Expense 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing 175,613 181,338 (5,725) (3.2) of revenue 39.0 45.3 
 
 Sales and marketing expense decreased 5.7 million, or 3.2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 10.9 million decrease in sales and marketing personnel costs. This decrease was partially offset by a 4.3 million increase in marketing costs and a 1.4 million increase in 
 38 

travel expenses. Sales and marketing personnel costs declined due to a decrease in sales and marketing headcount of 21 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 in addition due to a 2.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense and a 0.8 million decrease in severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by a 2.0 million increase in commissions expense. Marketing costs increased primarily due to spending on our annual Appian World conference and internal sales and marketing events as well as increased spending on public relations, advertising, and lead generation. Travel and entertainment expense increased due to a higher number of in-person events and engagements relative to the prior year. 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) Research and development 117,789 118,502 (713) (0.6) of revenue 26.2 29.6 
 
 Research and development expense decreased 0.7 million, or 0.6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 3.6 million decrease in research and development personnel costs and a 0.2 million decrease in professional fees. These decreases were partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in employee medical benefits, a 1.1 million increase in cloud computing expense, and a 0.7 million increase in rent expense. Although research and development personnel headcount increased 5 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, overall personnel costs decreased partially due to lower bonus expense, a 1.0 million decrease in severance expense, a 0.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, and additional realized cost savings from our product development center in India. Professional fees decreased due to a decline in consulting fees from lower usage of external resources to assist in our platform development efforts in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (dollars in thousands) General and administrative 
 108,327 82,342 25,985 31.6 of revenue 24.1 20.6 
 
 General and administrative expense increased 26.0 million, or 31.6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase of 11.2 million in amortization expense related to our judgment preservation insurance policy. In addition, professional fees increased 7.2 million due to higher legal fees incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior year and a 5.7 million decrease in insurance reimbursements associated with our litigation against Pegasystems as a result of receiving reimbursements in the prior year compared to none in the current year. Rent expense also increased 6.3 million, primarily driven by 5.5 million of lease impairment charges recognized during the second quarter of 2024.

Other Non-Operating Income, Net

Other income, net was 5.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other income, net of 4.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was attributed to a 1.8 million increase in other income related to short-swing profit disgorgement payments to us from a public stockholder of our Class A common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, in the first quarter of 2024, we received a 1.4 million payment from a state government related to the achievement of certain capital investment goals. These increases were partially offset by a 1.9 million decrease in interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior year stemming from decreased investments.

 Interest expense increased by 5.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to interest expense incurred on additional credit facility borrowings that we entered into during the first quarter of 2024 and the latter half of 2023.

 0.2 0.5 
 
 Income tax expense decreased by 1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to lower pre-tax book income at our foreign subsidiaries as well as a discrete benefit recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The discrete benefit was primarily related to net operating loss adjustments at one of our foreign subsidiaries. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial performance measures. We use these non-GAAP financial performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of 
 40 

our recurring core business operating results. We believe both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management s internal comparisons to historical performance as well as comparisons to competitors operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. 
 
 Our non-GAAP financial performance measures include the following: non-GAAP subscriptions cost of revenue, non-GAAP professional services costs of revenue, non-GAAP total cost of revenue, non-GAAP total operating expense, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted. These non-GAAP financial performance measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, certain non-ordinary litigation-related expenses consisting of legal and other professional fees associated with the Pegasystems cases (net of insurance reimbursements), or Litigation Expense, amortization of the judgment preservation insurance policy, or JPI Amortization, severance costs related to an involuntary reduction in our workforce, or Severance Costs, lease impairment and lease-related charges associated with actions taken to reduce the footprint of our leased office spaces, or Lease Impairment and Lease-Related Charges, and a short-swing profit disgorgement paid to us by an investor, or Short-Swing Profit Payment. While some of these items may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods as these items can vary significantly from period to period depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may occur. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses in the future, we believe removing these items for purposes of calculating our non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance. 
 
 We also discuss adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure we believe offers a useful view of the overall operation of our business. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1) other expense (income), net, (2) interest expense, (3) income tax expense, (4) depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets, (5) stock-based compensation expense, (6) Litigation Expense, (7) JPI Amortization, (8) Severance Costs, and (9) Lease Impairment and Lease-Related Charges. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA is net loss. Users should consider the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net loss as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. 
 
 The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 
 
 The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures (in thousands, except per share data):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The following table presents selected financial information and statistics pertaining to liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 99,193 149,351 Short-term investments and marketable securities 40,798 9,653 Property and equipment, net 39,190 42,682 Working capital 61,998 43,183 
 Defined as current assets net of current liabilities. 
 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and marketable securities, together with any positive cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit, will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 We have in the past, and may in the future enter into, investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, or technologies, which could also require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. We have no present binding agreements or commitments to enter into any such acquisitions. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
 Sources of Funds 
 
 We have historically financed our operations in large part with equity financing arrangements. Our last public offering was completed in June 2020. Through these public offerings, we received net proceeds of 344.8 million. 
 
 To further help strengthen our financial position and support our growth initiatives, in November 2022 we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facilities Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, which provides for a five-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 200.0 million and, in addition, up to 100.0 million for a revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of 20.0 million and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of 10.0 million (as a sublimit of the revolving loan facility). 
 
 The Credit Agreement matures on November 3, 2027. We have been using the proceeds to fund the growth of our business and support our working capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants, had used borrowing capacity of 62.0 million under our 100.0 million revolving credit facility, and had outstanding letters of credit totaling 14.7 million in connection with securing our leased office space. 
 
 We expect future sources of funds to consist primarily of cash generated from sales of subscriptions and the related professional services. We may also elect to raise additional sources of funding through entering into new debt financing arrangements or conducting additional public offerings. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, particularly internationally, the introduction of new and enhanced products and functions as well as platform enhancements and professional services offerings, and the level of market acceptance of our product. 
 
 44 

Uses of Funds 
 
 Our current principal uses of cash are funding operations and other working capital requirements. Historically, we have also utilized cash to pay for the acquisition of businesses that were complementary to ours, and we may pursue similar opportunities in the future. Over the past several years, revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, cash flows from customer collections have also grown. However, as we continue to invest in growing our business, operating expenses have also increased. 
 
 In 2023, we entered into a Judgment Preservation Insurance policy in connection with our 2.036 billion judgment against Pegasystems. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. The total cost of the policy was 57.3 million, which we paid with operating cash on hand. In addition, in February 2024 our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, under which we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately 50.0 million during the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Outside of the above items and cash used by operations, other uses of cash in 2024 to date have included capital expenditures related to the expansion of the new leased facility for our research development center in India and principal repayments of our term loan debt. 
 
 Furthermore, we have a non-cancellable cloud hosting arrangement with Amazon Web Services that contains provisions for minimum purchase commitments. Specifically, purchase commitments under the agreement total 131.0 million over five years. The agreement, which started in July 2021 and is now in its fourth year as of September 30, 2024, contains minimum spending requirements of 28.0 million in both the fourth and fifth years. Spending under this agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 10.8 million and 31.8 million, respectively. Spending under this agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, totaled 9.3 million and 27.8 million, respectively. The timing of payments under the agreement may vary, and the total amount of payments may exceed the minimum depending on the volume of services utilized.

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash used by operating activities was 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 102.2 million used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash used by operating activities was primarily due to the prior year payment of 57.3 million for our JPI policy. In addition, the decrease in cash used by operating activities was attributed to stronger cash collections from accounts receivable as a result of increased revenues as well as headcount reductions and other cost management activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used by investing activities was 34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.9 million in net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decline of 51.0 million in proceeds from the sale of investments, which was partially offset by a 10.8 million decrease in purchases of investments and a 5.0 million decrease in capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used by financing activities was 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 82.4 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a 50.0 million increase in common stock repurchases, a 42.0 million decrease in proceeds from borrowings, and a 1.1 million increase in debt repayments, all of which were partially offset by a 2.4 million decrease in payments for employee taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024. We are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require us to update our estimates, assumptions, and judgments.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 99.2 million as of September 30, 2024, which consisted of investments in money market funds, cash in readily available checking accounts, and overnight repurchase investments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding principal debt of 252.8 million, which carries interest as defined in our Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 8 of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details. We assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing sensitivity to our operating results, assuming various changes in market interest rates. A hypothetical increase of one percentage point in the interest rate as of September 30, 2024 would increase our interest expense by approximately 2.5 million annually. 
 
 Inflation Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks related to inflation in personnel costs, third-party service providers, subcontracting costs, professional fees, and general overhead expenses. Although inflation has decreased from the relative highs experienced in 2022, if inflation pressure increases in severity, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases and productivity initiatives. While we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations to date, a continued high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain operating costs and adversely affect our gross profit margin. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Due to our international operations, we have foreign currency risks related to revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, Euro, Australian dollar, and Swiss franc. Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in the local currency of the customer making the purchase. In addition, portions of operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies. An increase in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will negatively affect revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Based on a sensitivity analysis, a 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have impacted our total revenue by approximately 4 and operating loss by approximately 6 . This calculation assumes all currencies change in the same direction and proportion relative to the U.S. dollar. 
 
 We have experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring certain current asset and current liability balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits 
 47 

under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 Other Matters 
 
 From time to time, we are subject to legal, regulatory, and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.

 Mark Lynch 
 
 Letter of Engagement as Interim CFO 
 
 Dear Mark 
 
 Per our discussions, I am offering you employment as the Interim Chief Financial Officer Interim CFO of Appian, reporting to me, with a start date of November 4, 2024. This position is considered an exempt level position for the purposes of federal wage-hour law, and you will be paid on a semi-monthly basis in accordance with Appian s normal payroll procedure. The proposed compensation for your tenure as Interim CFO, subject to all necessary approvals by the Board of Directors, is as follows 
 
 First, you will receive a base salary paid at a rate of 1,000,000 per year, subject to all tax and other required withholdings. 
 
 Second, a bonus for your decision to come out of retirement to serve as our Interim CFO, to be comprised of two parts (a) a monthly bonus of 125,000 in each of the first six months of your employment as Interim CFO and (b) a grant of Restricted Stock Units with a value of 250,000 vesting on May 5, 2025. The actual number of stock units granted annually will be calculated and granted based on the closing stock price at the close of business on November 5, 2024, the date of the next scheduled Appian Board of Directors meeting. Should Appian successfully hire a new Chief Financial Officer who begins working in that position prior to May 5, 2025, and Appian therefore releases you from service as Interim CFO, Appian will pay you any remaining monthly bonuses set forth in part (a) above with your final paycheck from Appian. 
 
 Third, if your employment as Interim CFO lasts for more than 6 months, beginning in May 2025, your monthly cash bonuses will increase to 166,666.67 per month. 
 
 Your service as Interim CFO shall not interrupt your continued services as a Director of the Appian Board of Directors. You shall continue to be bound by all agreements related to your services as a Director, and continue to be bound by all policies applicable to an Appian Director. 
 
 Upon commencing your employment, you will be required to sign the Appian Employment Agreement. We note that your employment as Interim CFO will be at-will, meaning either you or Appian may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause. In accepting this offer of employment, you acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement made by Appian or any of its employees or representatives with regard to the terms of your employment unless such representation is specifically included in this written offer. 
 
 Sincerely,
