In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Company will continue
to attempt to secure equity and/or debt financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful, and without sufficient
financing, it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

 The ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding
paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. These financial statements do not include

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward Looking Statements 

 This
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (MD A) is intended to provide an
understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations. The following
MD A discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q and in the Company's S-1 Registration Statement. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that
reflect the Company's plans, estimates and beliefs. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed or referred
to in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those
discussed under the caption "Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results" and under Part I, Item
1A, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors." 

 GENERAL 

Overview 

We are a full-service
multi-media Company with a multi-operational approach focusing on Business Ready Opportunities through our ready to sell Business modules,
Website and mobile app technology integration design and development, SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Social Media Integration,
and online video and photography content development and distribution. In addition, the company owns the licensing rights to the Pro
Sun Lighting system for residential and commercial use, which we market to distributors. Websites are a unique mix of textual content,
photos, sometimes video, and often apps, which are designed as plug-ins to websites or for mobile devices, aiding in the conveyance of
a website's message, whether it be business-related or personal. We offer products and solutions to help our customers stand out in the
ever-changing internet environment. We have been capitalized through cash flows from operations and the proceeds from a Private Placement
offering. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we had gross revenues of 93,824 of which 47,897 was derived primarily from multi-media work (website design
and SEO). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had total operating expenses of 117,846 and a net loss of 43,750. 

For the year ended,
December 31, 2023, we had gross revenues of 132,974 of which 102,974 was derived primarily from multi-media work (website design and
SEO) and marketing revenue of 30,000. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had total expenses of 142,211 and a net loss of 23,000. 

 Our plans
are to continue to market our services for the integration of video with website design, SEO services, Business module sales, and the
sale of licensing rights to the Pro Sun Lighting system. We may also seek equity financing in the future. At this time, we have no arrangements
for any funding source. In addition, we are seeking potential acquisitions that fit within our business model. At this time, we have
not entered into any agreements with any entities.

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's financial statements which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments
on historical experiences and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue consists
substantially of fees earned from our services for the integration of video with website design, SEO services, Business module sales,
and the sale of licensing rights to the Pro Sun Lighting system. We recognize revenue from a sale of services or licensing arrangement
when all of the following conditions are met: non-refundable payment for licensing rights per a contract or; persuasive evidence of a
sale or licensing arrangement with a customer exists; the licensing rights, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, has been delivered
or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery; the license period of the arrangement has begun, and the customer can begin
its exploitation, exhibition, or sale; the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable; and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably
assured. We recognize revenue from website sales, the integration of video with website design, SEO services, Business module sales,
and the sale of licensing rights to the Pro sun Lighting system when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, a non-refundable contract, the delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable,
and collectability is reasonably assured upon invoicing for work. 

 Results of Operations 

For the Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

 For the nine months ended September
30, 2024 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we generated gross revenues of 93,824, primarily from multimedia services, including website design and SEO. The revenue growth was
largely driven by increased website sales and design activities. During the same period, our cost of goods sold amounted to 18,330. 

 Total expenses for the nine-month period was
 117,846, including advertising and marketing costs of 32,446, depreciation and amortization expenses of 1,080, professional fees of
 17,500, consulting fees of 33,600, interest expenses of 1,398, and general and administrative expenses totaling 33,220. These expenses
resulted in a net loss of 43,750. 

 The increase in operating expenses was primarily
due to costs associated with our Registration Statement and the overall expansion of our business activities. 

13 

For the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 

For the nine months ending September 30, 2023,
we had gross revenues of 85,715, derived primarily from multi-media work (website design and SEO). During the same period, our cost
of goods sold amounted to 1,331. 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we
had total expenses of 102,389, advertising and marketing of 25,900, depreciation and amortization expense of 290, professional fees
of 10,925, consulting fees of 37,800 interest expense of 1,398 and general and administrative expense of 27,474 resulting in a net
loss of 19,403. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2024 

 For the three months ending September 30,
2024, we had gross revenues of 17,779 derived primarily from multi-media work (website design and SEO). Our revenue declined compared
to the previous year due to the inherently unpredictable nature of our business. During the same period, our cost of goods sold amounted
to 4,636. 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we had total expenses of 32,506, advertising and marketing of 53, depreciation and amortization expense of 360, consulting fees of
 8,400, interest expense of 466, and general and administrative expense of 19,193, resulting in a net loss of 19,829. Our operating
expenses increased due to the costs associated with our Registration Statement and an increase in our business. 

 For the three months ended September 30,
2023 

 For the three months ending September 30,
2023, we had gross revenues of 26,752 derived primarily from multi-media work (website design and SEO). During the same period, our
cost of goods sold amounted to 113. 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we
had total expenses of 28,672, advertising and marketing of 6,377, depreciation and amortization expense of 120, professional fees
of 775, consulting fees of 12,600 interest expense of 466, and general and administrative expense of 8,800 resulting in a net loss
of 703. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

For the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 

 We had 3,827 cash from operating activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to using 12,838 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The difference
was due to a greater operating loss of 43,750 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compares to a loss of 19,403 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

 For the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, we had 0 from investing activities, which was the result of payments received for a loan, compared
to 7,200 from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

 The Company
has insufficient cash resources available to fund its primary operations. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues
sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of 358,685 and 314,935, respectively. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company
obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital,
it could be forced to cease operations. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional
capital resources. The Company is dependent upon its ability, and will continue to attempt, to secure equity and/or debt financing. There
are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue
as a going concern. 

 The ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding
paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. These financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts for amounts and classification of liabilities
that might result from this uncertainty. 

 If we do not receive
any additional revenue or receive additional funding we would not have the ability to implement our business plan. The Company has no
agreements in place with its shareholders, officer and director or with any third parties to fund operations. The Company has not negotiated
nor has available to it any other third party sources of liquidity. 

The Company has no,
current, off balance sheet arrangements and does not anticipate entering into any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably
likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition. 

14 

Plan of Operation 

We plan to
continue to market sale of website design, multi-media services, focusing on the integration of video with website design, SEO services,
business modules and the licensing rights to the Pro sun Lighting system. We may also seek equity financing in the future. Currently,
we have no arrangements for any funding source. In addition, we are seeking potential acquisitions that fit within our business model.
Currently, we have not entered into any agreements with any entities. 

 Marketing
and Sales efforts: 

 Our marketing
efforts will primarily be related to marketing website design, multimedia services, SEO services, business modules and the sale of licensing
rights to the Pro sun Lighting system. 

 We plan on
optimizing Search Engine Optimization ("SEO") work and internet marketing and subsequently believe sales will be initially
supported through our website. We also plan on engaging a call center to develop an interest in our products within the next fiscal year.
Successful implementation of our business strategy depends on factors specific to the further development of our products, regulations
regarding equities trading, additional financing through equity or debt sources, and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control.
Adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations and cash flow: 

The
 ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers' needs for trading products in a timely cost-effective
 manner; and; 

The
 ability to establish, maintain and eventually grow market share in a competitive environment. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk 

 As a smaller reporting
company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. 

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 An evaluation was
performed under the supervision of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial
Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.
Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of September
30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms due to material weaknesses in our internal controls 

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. 

We have made no change
in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

15
