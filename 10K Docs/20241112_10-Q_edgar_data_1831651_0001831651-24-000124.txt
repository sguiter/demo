FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q of Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (the Company, we, us, our, and Shoals contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations; expectations regarding the utility scale solar market; project delays; regulatory environment; the effects of competitive dynamics, volume discounts and customer mix in our key markets; pipeline and orders; business strategies; technology developments; financing and investment plans; warranty, litigation and liability accruals and estimates of loss or gains; estimates of potential loss related to the wire insulation shrinkback (as defined below) matter; litigation strategy and expected benefits or results from the current intellectual property and wire insulation shrinkback litigation; potential growth opportunities, including international growth, production and capacity at our plants; and potential repurchases under the Company s Repurchase Program (as defined below). Forward-looking statements include statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, seek, should, will, would or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. 
 Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Also, forward-looking statements represent our management s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this report. You should read this report with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. 
 Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are included in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part I and Item 1A Risk Factors of Part II of this Form 10-Q, as well as Part I Item 1A Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include the following: 
 if demand for solar energy projects does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate, including as a result of industry project delays, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business will suffer; 
 if we fail to accurately estimate the potential losses related to the wire insulation shrinkback matter, or fail to recover the costs and expenses incurred by us from the supplier, our profit margins, financial results, business and prospects could be materially adversely impacted; 
 defects or performance problems in our products or their parts, including those related to the wire insulation shrinkback matter, could result in loss of customers, reputational damage and decreased revenue, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 current macroeconomic events, including high inflation, high interest rates, a potential recession, uncertainty surrounding the impact of the election cycle and geopolitical instability could impact our business and financial results; 
 a further increase in interest rates or a reduction in the availability of tax incentives or project debt capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for end customers to finance the cost of a solar energy system and could reduce the demand for our products; 
 iv 

Table of Contents 

existing electric utility industry, renewable energy and solar energy policies and regulations, and any subsequent changes, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar energy systems that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete; 
 changes in the U.S. trade environment, including the imposition of trade restrictions, import tariffs, anti-dumping and countervailing duties could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenue, results of operations or cash flows; 
 we may experience delays, disruptions, quality control or reputational problems in our manufacturing operations in part due to our vendor concentration; 
 if we or our suppliers face disputes with labor unions, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer;

 our products are primarily manufactured and shipped from our production facilities in Tennessee, and any damage or disruption at these facilities may harm our business; 
 we may face difficulties with respect to the planned consolidation and relocation of our Tennessee-based manufacturing and distribution operations, and may not realize the benefits thereof; 
 unsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, negatively impact customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, and negatively impact employee morale and turnover; 
 the market for our products is competitive, and we may face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce EBOS system solutions and components, which could negatively affect our results of operations and market share; 
 our industry has historically been cyclical and experienced periodic downturns; 
 the interruption of the flow of raw materials from international vendors has disrupted our supply chain, including as a result of the imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports; 
 we are subject to risks associated with legal proceedings and claims, including the patent infringement complaints that we filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission (the ITC and two District Courts, the securities and derivative litigation initiated in 2024, and other legal proceedings and claims, which may or may not arise in the normal course of our business; 
 if we fail to, or incur significant costs in order to, obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, including those that are subject to the patent infringement complaints we filed with the ITC and two District Courts, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed; 
 acquisitions, joint ventures and/or investments and the failure to integrate acquired businesses, could disrupt our business and/or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock; 
 a loss of one or more of our significant customers, their inability to perform under their contracts, or their default in payment could harm our business and negatively impact revenue, results of operations, and cash flow; 
 a significant drop in the price of electricity sold may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects; 
 v 

Table of Contents

 failure to effectively utilize information technology systems or implement new technologies and the unauthorized disclosure of personal or sensitive data or confidential information, whether through a breach of our computer system or otherwise, could severely disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability; 
 compromises, interruptions or shutdowns of our information technology systems, including those managed by third parties, whether intentional or inadvertent, have led to delays in our business operations and, if future incidents are significant or extreme, could affect our results of operations; 
 our expansion outside the U.S. could subject us to additional business, financial, regulatory and competitive risks; 
 our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position; 
 our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations; 
 developments in alternative technologies may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings; 
 amounts included in our backlog and awarded orders may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits;

 million and , respectively. The Company recorded total warranty expense related to general warranty matters of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Wire Insulation Shrinkback Warranty 
 The Company has been notified by certain customers that a subset of wire harnesses used in its EBOS solutions is presenting unacceptable levels of contraction of wire insulation wire insulation shrinkback ). Based upon the Company s ongoing assessment, the Company currently believes the wire insulation shrinkback is related to defective wire manufactured by Prysmian Cables and Systems USA, LLC Prysmian ). Based on the Company s continued analysis of information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company determined that a potential range of loss was both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company has continued to refine assumptions based on additional information obtained throughout the remediation process, and as of September 30, 2024, determined that it was appropriate to adjust the range from the estimates provided as of June 30, 2024. Based on additional information obtained, the Company has increased the low-end of the estimated range from million to million, and decreased the high-end of the estimated range from million to million. As no amount within the current range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recorded a warranty liability and related expense representing the low-end of the range of potential loss of million, which resulted in an increase in the warranty liability and warranty expense of million. The high-end of the range of potential loss is million, which is million higher than the amount recorded. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining estimated warranty liability related to this matter was million and million, respectively. 
 The estimated range, as revised, continues to be based on several assumptions, including the potential magnitude of engineering, procurement and construction firm s labor cost to identify and perform the repair and replacement of impacted harnesses, estimated failure rates, materials replacement cost, planned remediation method, inspection costs, and other various assumptions. While our wire insulation shrinkback warranty liability represents our best estimate of the range of expected losses at any given time, the Company remains active in the ongoing identification, repair and replacement process and has increased, and may further increase or decrease, its estimated warranty liability from its current estimate based on available information, including with respect to experience relating to weather delays, site access, the scope of replacement, vegetation management or other factors. Such increase or decrease may be material. The Company does not maintain insurance for product warranty issues and has commenced a lawsuit against Prysmian, as discussed in more detail under Wire Insulation Shrinkback Litigation section of Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies. Because the lawsuit against Prysmian is ongoing, potential recovery from Prysmian is not considered probable as defined in ASC 450, and has not been considered in our estimate of the warranty liability as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company recorded warranty expense related to this matter of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million and million, respectively, during three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Senior Secured Credit Agreement 
 The Company entered into a senior secured credit agreement (as amended, the Senior Secured Credit Agreement ), which consisted of (i) a senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility and (ii) a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). 
 On January 19, 2024, the Company used proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility to make a million voluntary prepayment of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. 
 On March 19, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. The amendment, among other things, (i) increased the amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility from million to million, (ii) reduced the interest rate margin applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility by at least , with additional step-downs if the consolidated first lien secured leverage ratio does not exceed certain thresholds (which step-downs will step back up if such leverage ratio exceeds those thresholds), (iii) reduced the commitment fee applicable to the undrawn amount of the Revolving Credit Facility by at least with additional step-downs if the consolidated first lien secured leverage ratio does not exceed certain thresholds (which step-downs will step back up if such leverage ratio exceeds such thresholds), (iv) lowered the maximum consolidated leverage ratio permitted under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement to (a) :1.00 from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025 and (b) thereafter, :1.00 (with temporary increases to the maximum consolidated first lien secured leverage ratio in the event a material acquisition closes), (v) extended the maturity date applicable to the Revolving Credit

 million voluntary prepayment of all the outstanding term loans under the Term Loan Facility, thereby terminating all term loan commitments under the Term Loan Facility. 
 Beginning March 19, 2024 and until the delivery of the Company s compliance certificate for the second quarter of 2024 pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at a rate equal to, at the Company s election, either adjusted term SOFR or base rate (each, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) plus (i) in the case of SOFR rate loans, per annum and (ii) in the case of base rate loans, per annum. 
 Following the delivery of the Company s compliance certificate for the second quarter of 2024, pursuant to our Senior Secured Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to, at the Company s election, either adjusted term SOFR or base rate (each, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) plus an applicable interest rate margin, based upon the consolidated first lien secured leverage ratio. The applicable interest rate margin varies from to per annum for term benchmark loans and to per annum for base rate loans. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility ranged from to , which represented SOFR plus . As of September 30, 2024, there were million of outstanding borrowings, million of outstanding letters of credit, and million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Senior Secured Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for financings of this type, including covenants that restrict our incurrence of indebtedness, incurrence of liens, dispositions, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. The Senior Secured Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control. 
 As discussed above, the Revolving Credit Facility also includes a consolidated leverage ratio financial covenant that is tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all the required covenants.

 of Shoals Parent LLC, was the sole managing member of Shoals Parent LLC and had the sole voting power in, and controlled the management of, Shoals Parent LLC. On July 1, 2023, the Company contributed of its LLC Interests to Shoals Intermediate Parent. Following the contribution, Shoals Parent LLC became a disregarded single member limited liability company, eliminating the Company s Up-C structure. Effective December 31, 2023, Shoals Parent LLC merged with and into Shoals Intermediate Parent with Shoals Intermediate Parent as the surviving corporation. 
 Prior to the Company owning of Shoals Parent LLC, the remaining interest in Shoals Parent LLC was held by the Continuing Equity Owners, who could exchange at each of their respective options, in whole or in part, from time to time, their LLC Interests (along with an equal number of shares of Class B common stock (which shares were then immediately canceled)) for cash or newly issued shares of our Class A common stock. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the financial results of Shoals Parent LLC and reported non-controlling interests in its condensed consolidated financial statements. In accordance with the limited liability company agreement of Shoals Parent LLC, Shoals Parent LLC made cash distributions to its members in an amount sufficient to cover the members tax liabilities, if any, with respect to each member s share of Shoals Parent LLC taxable earnings. The payment of these cash distributions by Shoals Parent LLC to Continuing Equity Owners was recorded as distributions to holders of LLC Interests in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of stockholders equity and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 Common Stock Economic and Voting Rights 
 Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock (if any shares are outstanding) are entitled to vote per share and, except as otherwise required, vote together as a single class on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Holders of Class B common stock (if any shares are outstanding) are not entitled to receive dividends and will not be entitled to receive any distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Shares of Class B common stock were only issuable to the extent necessary to maintain the -to-one ratio between the number of LLC Interests held by the Continuing Equity Owners and the number of shares of Class B common stock held by the Continuing Equity Owners. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of Class B common stock nor LLC Interests outstanding, and shares of Class B common stock are currently issuable. Shares of Class B common stock were transferable only together with an equal number of LLC Interests. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program and Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement

 Retainage Accounts receivable, net Unbilled receivables Unbilled receivables Deferred revenue Deferred revenue 
 The majority of the Company s contract amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, which generally coincide with the shipment of one or more phases of the project. Billing sometimes occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in unbilled receivables. The changes in unbilled receivables relate to fluctuations in the timing of billings for the Company s revenue recognized over time. As of December 31, 2022, billed accounts receivable and unbilled receivables were million and million, respectively. 
 Certain contracts contain retainage provisions. Retainage represents a contract asset for the portion of the contract price earned by the Company for work performed but held for payment by the customer as a form of security until the Company obtains specified milestones. The Company typically bills retainage amounts as work is performed. Retainage provisions are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect the customer in the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed. The changes in retainage relate to fluctuations in the timing of retainage billings and achievement of specified milestones. As of December 31, 2022, retainage was million. 
 The Company also receives deferred revenue in the form of customer deposits. The customer deposits are short term as the related performance obligations are typically fulfilled within 12 months. The changes in deferred revenue relate to fluctuations in the timing of customer deposits and completion of performance obligations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, of deferred revenue recorded as of December 31, 2023 was recognized in revenue. As of December 31, 2022, deferred revenue was million and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, million and million, respectively, of deferred revenue recorded as of December 31, 2022, was recognized in revenue.

 Overview 
 We are a leading provider of electrical balance of systems EBOS solutions for the energy transition market. EBOS encompasses all of the components that are necessary to carry the electric current produced by solar panels to an inverter and ultimately to the power grid. EBOS components are mission-critical products that have a high consequence of failure, including lost revenue, equipment damage, fire damage, and even serious injury or death. As a result, we generally believe customers prioritize reliability and safety over price when selecting EBOS solutions. 
 EBOS components that we produce include cable assemblies, inline fuses, combiners, disconnects, recombiners, wireless monitoring systems, junction boxes, transition enclosures, splice boxes, and battery energy storage cabinets. We derive the majority of our revenue from selling system solutions which are complete EBOS systems that include several of our products, many of which are customized for the customer s project. We believe our system solutions are unique in our industry because they integrate design and engineering support, proprietary components and innovative installation methods into a single offering that would otherwise be challenging for a customer to obtain from a single provider or at all. 
 We sell our solar products principally to engineering, procurement and construction firms EPCs that build solar energy projects. However, given the mission-critical nature of EBOS, the decision to use our products typically involves input from both the EPC and the owner of the solar energy project. The custom nature of our system solutions and the long development cycle for solar energy projects typically gives us 12 
 23 

months or more of lead time to quote, engineer, produce and ship each order we receive, and we do not stock large amounts of finished goods. 
 Throughout the first three quarters of 2024, we have maintained focus on our growth strategy and continued strengthening our leadership position in the industry. We believe that as of September 30, 2024, we have worked with 13 of the top 15 U.S. solar EPCs, per Wood Mackenzie data from 2022-2024, and 11 of those EPCs used our combine-as-you-go system on their projects. 
 We derived 76.3 of our revenue from the sale of system solutions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the same period, we derived substantially all of our revenue from customers in the U.S. As of September 30, 2024, we had 596.6 million of backlog and awarded orders, backlog of 153.4 million represents signed purchase orders or contractual minimum purchase commitments with take-or-pay provisions and awarded orders of 443.2 million are orders we are in the process of documenting a contract for but for which a contract has not yet been signed. As of September 30, 2024, we believe approximately 144.4 million of backlog and 310.8 million of awarded orders have delivery dates in the next twelve months. Additionally, more than 13 of our September 30, 2024 backlog and awarded orders related to international projects. As of September 30, 2024, backlog and awarded orders decreased by 5.8 relative to the same date last year and decreased by 7.1 relative to June 30, 2024, as a result of previously disclosed project delays. 
 Trends and Uncertainties 
 Global inflationary pressures are expected to persist to a lesser extent during the remainder of 2024. As a result of such inflationary pressures, increased energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs continued in the first three quarters of 2024 and are expected to persist during the rest of 2024. Increased interest rates also continued to result in generally higher interest rates associated with our Senior Secured Credit Agreement in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and continued high interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital during our forecasted period. 
 Our ability to obtain raw materials required to manufacture our components and system solutions from domestic and international suppliers, as well as our ability to secure inbound logistics to and from our facilities, were still impacted in 2023 and the first three quarters of 2024. The Company does not directly source a significant amount of raw materials from Europe. However, the Russia-Ukraine war has reduced the availability of certain materials that can be sourced in Europe and, as a result, increased global logistics costs for the procurement of some inputs and materials used in our products. We expect these trends to persist throughout the remainder of 2024. 
 In addition, changes over the last few years in the international relations and tariff regimes between the U.S. and China in response to various political issues and heightened uncertainty regarding China-Taiwan relations could significantly adversely impact the availability of parts and components to us, and, correspondingly, our ability to produce our components at targeted levels, although we did not materially experience such negative effects during the first three quarters of 2024. We continue to monitor the condition of our supply chain and evaluate our procurement strategy to reduce any negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we continued to monitor and optimize our inventory levels. 
 During 2023 and continuing in the first three quarters in 2024, the domestic utility scale solar market experienced project delays that have pushed projects beyond 2024. Additionally, in 2023, the domestic utility scale solar market started experiencing slowing growth, which is expected to persist in the near term. These trends are the result of the costs of permitting issues; project financing; lingering uncertainty about the application of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to solar projects; uncertainty regarding changes in the U.S. trade environment, including the imposition of trade restrictions, import tariffs, anti-dumping and countervailing 
 24 

duties; supply chain constraints; and interconnection complications. We expect these trends to persist beyond 2024 and reverse over time. These project slowdowns and delays have impacted our results, lowering demand and sales volume. However, even though we expect our growth rate to decline from the very high levels of the last few years, we believe that our domestic utility scale business will continue growing at an attractive rate. 
 Our company continues to navigate the uncertainties relating to project delays. Additionally, we are experiencing competitive dynamics, volume discounts, and customer mix in our key markets, which so far have immaterially impacted our results of operations. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 The following discussion describes certain line items in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue from the sale of EBOS systems and components for homerun and combine-as-you-go architectures, battery storage, and operations and maintenance offerings. Our customers include EPCs, utilities, solar developers, independent power producers, and solar module manufacturers. We derive the majority of our revenue from selling solar system solutions. When we sell a solar system solution, we enter into a contract with our customers covering the price, specifications, delivery dates and warranty for the products being purchased, among other things. Our contractual delivery period for solar system solutions can vary from one to three months whereas manufacturing typically requires a shorter time frame. Contracts for solar system solutions can range in value from several hundred thousand to several million dollars. 
 Our revenue is affected by changes in the price, volume and mix of solar system solutions and components purchased by our customers. The price and volume of our system solutions and components is driven by the demand for our solar system solutions and components, changes in product mix between homerun and combine-as-you-go EBOS, geographic mix of our customers, strength of competitors product offerings, and availability of government incentives to the end-users of our products. 
 Our revenue growth is dependent on continued growth in the amount of solar energy projects constructed each year and our ability to increase our share of demand in the geographies where we currently compete and plan to compete in the future, as well as our ability to continue to develop and commercialize new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of system solutions and components costs, including purchased raw materials, as well as costs related to shipping, customer support, product warranty, personnel and depreciation of manufacturing and testing equipment. Personnel costs in cost of revenue include both direct labor costs as well as costs attributable to any individuals whose activities relate to the transformation of raw materials or component parts into finished goods or the transportation of materials to the customer. Our product costs are affected by the underlying cost of raw materials, including copper and aluminum; component costs, including fuses, resin, enclosures, and cable; technological innovation; economies of scale resulting in lower component costs; and improvements in production processes and automation. We do not currently hedge against changes in the price of raw materials. Some of these costs, primarily indirect personnel and depreciation of manufacturing and testing equipment, are not directly affected by sales volume. Gross profit may vary from year to year and is primarily affected by our sales volume, product prices, product costs, product mix, customer mix, geographical mix, shipping method and warranty expense. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Personnel-related costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses and include salaries, equity-based compensation, benefits, payroll taxes and commissions. The number of full- 
 25 

time employees in our general and administrative departments increased from 139 to 165 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, and we expect to hire new employees in the future to support our future growth. The timing of these additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses in any particular period, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, equity-based compensation expense, employee benefits and payroll taxes related to our executives, and our sales, finance, human resources, information technology, engineering and legal organizations, travel expenses, facilities costs, marketing expenses, insurance, bad debt expense and fees for professional services. Professional services consist of audit, tax, accounting, legal, internal controls, information technology, investor relations and other costs. We expect to increase our sales and marketing personnel as we expand into new geographic markets. Substantially all of our sales are currently in the U.S. We currently have a sales presence in the U.S., Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and Africa. We intend to grow our sales presence and marketing efforts in current geographic markets and expand to additional countries in the future. 
 Depreciation 
 Depreciation in our operating expenses consists of costs associated with property, plant and equipment PP E not used in manufacturing our products. We expect that as we increase both our revenue and the number of our general and administrative personnel, we will invest in additional PP E to support our growth resulting in additional depreciation expense. 
 Amortization 
 Amortization of intangibles consists of amortization of customer relationships, developed technology, and trade names over their expected period of use. 
 Non-operating Expenses 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest and other charges paid in connection with our Senior Secured Credit Agreement. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. is subject to U.S. federal and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. Prior to the July 1, 2023 contribution described in Note 1 - Organization and Business, Shoals Parent LLC was a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes but incurred income tax in certain state jurisdictions. On July 1, 2023, the Company contributed 100 of its limited liability interests of Shoals Parent LLC to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Shoals Intermediate Parent, Inc., and following the contribution, Shoals Parent LLC became a disregarded single member limited liability company, eliminating the umbrella-partnership C corporation structure.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue decreased by 32.0 million, or 24 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by lower sales volumes primarily resulting from lower demand as a result of solar project delays that have pushed projects out from the first three quarters of 2024, and to a lesser extent, competitive dynamics, volume discounts, and customer mix in our key markets. 
 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 Cost of revenue decreased by 43.3 million, or 36 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the decrease in revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 24.8 during three months ended September 30, 2024, and 10.5 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was driven by a decrease in wire insulation shrinkback expenses recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was offset by an increase in labor costs, non-recurring operational charges, competitive dynamics, volume discounts, and customer mix in our key markets, and a reduction in leverage on fixed costs.

Operating Expenses 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 3.8 million, or 17 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was the result of a decrease in equity based compensation of 3.6 million due to a reduction in the probable outcome of PSU performance vesting conditions and forfeiture of RSUs and PSUs related to the resignation of a former officer, as well as a decrease in wages and related taxes of 0.8 million related to a decrease in bonus expense resulting from a decrease in estimated payouts under our annual incentive plan. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by less than 0.1 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to definite lived intangible assets that became fully amortized during 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, net decreased by 2.8 million, or 48 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to a decrease in the total weighted average outstanding balance of the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as well as a decrease in borrowing rates applicable to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement as a result of the amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and decreases in the federal funds effective rate. 
 
 Income tax benefit (expense) 
 Income tax expense totaled 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income tax benefit of 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 118.6 and 40.3 , respectively. The change in our effective income tax rate was due to various discrete items, particularly RSU and PSU shortfalls and return to provision adjustments, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 we recorded an income tax benefit of 5.1 million in connection with termination of the Up-C structure on July 1, 2023, which increased our effective income tax rate when considered in relation to the net loss recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue decreased by 66.3 million, or 18 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by lower sales volumes resulting from solar project delays that have pushed projects out from the first three quarters of 2024, and to a lesser extent, competitive dynamics, volume discounts, and customer mix in our key markets. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 Cost of revenue decreased by 55.2 million, or 22 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the decrease in revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 34.8 , as compared to 31.5 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit as a 
 28 

percentage of revenue was driven by a decrease in wire insulation shrinkback expenses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was offset by an increase in labor costs, competitive dynamics, volume discounts, and customer mix in our key markets, and a reduction in leverage on fixed costs. 
 Operating Expenses 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased 1.5 million, or 2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was the result of an increase in professional fees of 5.2 million primarily related to legal fees incurred in connection with the ongoing patent infringement, wire insulation shrinkback litigation, and securities litigation, as well as an increase in wages and related taxes of 1.4 million due to increased employee headcount to support our future growth. These increases are offset by a decrease in equity-based compensation of 6.3 million related to a reduction in the probable outcome of PSU performance vesting conditions and forfeiture of RSUs and PSUs related to the resignation of a former officer during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as termination of our former Chief Executive Officer s employment for disability in March 2023, which resulted in acceleration of equity based compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by less than 0.1 million, or 1.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to definite lived intangible assets that became fully amortized during 2023. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to additional purchases of PP E to support our growth initiatives. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, net decreased by 7.9 million, or 43 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to a write-off of 2.5 million of unamortized deferred interest as a result of voluntary prepayments made on, and the payoff of, the Term Loan Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as a decrease in the total weighted average outstanding balance of the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and a decrease in borrowing rates applicable to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. The decrease was offset by a write-off of 2.3 million of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of voluntary prepayments made on, and the payoff of, the Term Loan Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income tax benefit (expense) 
 Income tax expense was 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to income tax expense of 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 32.5 and 9.3 , respectively. The increase in our effective income tax rate was due to an income tax benefit of 5.1 million recorded in connection with termination of the Up-C structure on July 1, 2023, as discussed in more detail in Note 14 - Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was further increased by various discrete items, particularly RSU and PSU shortfalls, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share EPS 
 We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit plus wire insulation shrinkback expenses. We define Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by revenue. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax benefit (expense), (iii) depreciation expense, (iv) amortization of intangibles, (v) equity-based compensation, (vi) wire insulation shrinkback expenses, and (vii) wire insulation shrinkback litigation expenses. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) attributable to Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. plus (i) net income (loss) impact from assumed exchange of Class B common stock to Class A common stock as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, (ii) adjustment to the provision for income tax, (iii) amortization of intangibles, (iv) amortization / write-off of deferred financing costs, (v) equity-based compensation, (vi) wire insulation shrinkback expenses, and (vii) wire insulation shrinkback litigation expenses, all net of applicable income taxes. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net Income divided by the diluted weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding for the applicable period, which assumes the exchange of all outstanding Class B common stock for Class A common stock as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS are intended as supplemental measures of performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We present Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS: (i) as factors in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation, as applicable; (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and (iii) because our credit agreement uses measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS to measure our compliance with certain covenants. 
 Among other limitations, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and may be calculated by other companies in our industry differently than we do or not at all, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Because of these limitations, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. You should review the reconciliation of gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, and net income (loss) attributable to Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

 (a) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents (i) 13.3 million of wire insulation shrinkback warranty expenses related to the identification, repair and replacement of a subset of wire harnesses presenting unacceptable levels of wire insulation shrinkback, (ii) zero and 0.5 million, respectively, of inventory write-downs of wire in connection with wire insulation shrinkback. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 represents, (i) 50.2 million and 59.1 million, respectively, of wire insulation shrinkback warranty expenses related to the identification, repair and replacement of a subset of wire harnesses presenting unacceptable levels of wire insulation shrinkback, and (ii) zero and 2.6 million, respectively, of inventory write-downs of wire in connection with the identification, repair and replacement of a subset of wire harnesses presenting unacceptable levels of wire insulation shrinkback. We consider expenses incurred in connection with the identification, repair and replacement of the impacted wire harnesses distinct from normal, ongoing service identification, repair and replacement expenses that would be reflected under ongoing warranty expenses within the operation of our business, which we do not exclude from our non-GAAP measures. In the future, we also intend to exclude from our non-GAAP measures the benefit of liability releases, if any. We believe excluding expenses from these discrete liability events provides investors with a better view of the operating performance of our business and allows for comparability through periods. See Note 8 - Warranty Liability, in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for more information. 
 (b) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents 2.3 million and 4.5 million, respectively, of expenses incurred in connection with the lawsuit initiated by the Company against the supplier of the defective wire. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents 0.6 million of expenses incurred in connection with the lawsuit initiated by the Company against the supplier of the defective wire. We consider this litigation distinct from ordinary course legal matters given the expected magnitude of the expenses, the nature of the allegations in the Company s complaint, the amount of damages sought, and the impact of the matter underlying the litigation on the Company s financial results. In the future, we also intend to exclude from our non-GAAP measures the benefit of recovery, if any. We believe excluding expenses from these discrete litigation events provides investors with a better view of the operating performance of our business and allows for comparability through periods. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies, in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We finance our operations primarily with operating cash flows and short and long-term borrowings. Our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations is dependent on the strength of our gross profits as well as our ability to quickly turn our working capital. Based on our past performance and current expectations, we believe that operating cash flows and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our near and long-term future cash needs. 
 We generated cash from operating activities of 66.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash provided by operating activities of 65.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 11.1 million, a decrease from 22.7 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 we had outstanding borrowings of 141.8 million, a decrease from 183.8 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we also had 57.9 million available for additional borrowings under our 200.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. 
 On December 27, 2023 and January 19, 2024, we used borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand to make voluntary prepayments of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility of 50.0 million and 100.0 million, respectively. Following the amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement on March 19, 2024, which, among other things, increased the amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility from 150.0 million to 200.0 million, we made a 43.8 million voluntary prepayment of all the outstanding term loans under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, thereby terminating the Term Loan Facility. 
 33 

On June 11, 2024, the Company announced the Repurchase Program authorizing the repurchase of up to 150.0 million of the Company s Class A common stock, with an estimated completion date of December 31, 2025. Under the Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of Class A common stock through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. 
 In connection with the Repurchase Program, on June 11, 2024, the Company entered into an ASR with Jefferies LLC to repurchase 25.0 million of the Company s Class A common stock. Under the terms of the ASR, the Company paid 25.0 million to Jefferies LLC on June 12, 2024, and received a total of 3,908,387 shares of the Company s Class A common stock upon final settlement. Final settlement was based on a repurchase price of 6.40 per share, which was based on the average of the daily volume weighted average price per share of the Company s Class A common stock during the term of the ASR, less a discount. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also used approximately 15.2 million of cash to pay for expenses related to the identification, repair and replacement of the wire harnesses impacted in connection with the wire insulation shrinkback matter. We expect to continue spending significant amounts of cash in connection thereof. For more information, see Note 8 - Warranty Liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 66.4 million, primarily due to operating results that included 16.3 million of net income, which included 47.6 million of non-cash expense, along with decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of 38.2 million. These cash inflows were offset by cash outflows of 15.4 million related to the warranty liability as well as an increase in inventory of 14.6 million, an increase in other assets of 2.7 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1.4 million, and a decrease of 1.7 million in deferred revenue. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was 65.5 million, primarily due to operating results that included 26.1 million of net income, which included 92.0 million of non-cash expense, along with an increase of 10.7 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a decrease of 8.3 million in inventory, and an increase of 3.8 million in deferred revenue. These cash inflows were offset by an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of 70.4 million and cash outflows of 3.7 million related to the warranty liability. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 6.9 million, which was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.

Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 71.1 million, primarily due to 143.8 million in principal payments on the Term Loan Facility, 25.3 million paid to repurchase the Company s Class A Common Stock under the ASR, 2.6 million of deferred financing costs paid in connection with the amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, and 1.2 million in taxes related to net share settled equity awards. These cash outflows are offset by 101.8 million in net proceeds on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 57.1 million, primarily due to 3.9 million in taxes related to net share settled equity awards, 48.0 million in net payments on the Revolving Credit Facility, 1.5 million in principal payments on the Term Loan Facility, and 2.6 million in distributions to our non-controlling interest holders.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon 
 35 

the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims that arise out of our operations and businesses and that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, intellectual property matters, contract and employment claims, personal injury claims, product liability claims and warranty claims. Except as described under Litigation in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies, there are no claims or proceedings to which we are party that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, we may incur significant costs and experience a diversion of management resources as a result of litigation. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 For a discussion of the material factors that make an investment in the Company speculative or risky, please see the risk factors disclosure in our 2023 Form 10-K, in addition to the information set forth below in this Form 10-Q. 
 We may not repurchase all shares authorized under our Repurchase Program, we cannot guarantee that the Repurchase Program will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our Class A common stock. 
 Pursuant to the Repurchase Program announced by the Company on June 11, 2024, we are authorized to repurchase up to 150 million of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock from time to time through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. Except for the 25 million of shares we were obligated to repurchase pursuant to the ASR agreement we entered into on June 11, 2024, we are not obligated to repurchase any shares, and the timing, manner, price, and actual amount of share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, market conditions, other capital management needs and opportunities, and corporate and regulatory considerations. Further, our Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The timing of additional repurchases pursuant to our Repurchase Program could affect the price of our Class A common stock and increase its volatility. For example, any failure to repurchase Class A common stock after we announced our intention to do so may negatively impact investor confidence in us, impacting our stock price. Repurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available, impacting our liquidity, and there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the stock price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we effected repurchases.
