Subsequent to September 30, 2024, in connection with dispositions, the Company has repaid debt totaling million, of which million was on lines of credit, increasing its availability to the full capacity of million. The business model of the Company, and of real estate investment companies in general, utilizes debt as a structural source of financing. When debt becomes due, it is generally refinanced rather than repaid using the Company s cash flow from operations. The Company has a history of being able to refinance its debt obligations prior to maturity. Furthermore, the Company also has a substantial portfolio of real estate assets and demonstrated ability to readily sell assets if necessary to fund any immediate liquidity needs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million of mortgage and other debt against a portfolio of real estate assets with a net book value of million (however, see Note 12 Subsequent Events for additional information regarding the Company s property dispositions and debt repayments subsequent to September 30, 2024). million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Rental income is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of the Company s leases provide for tenants to reimburse the Company for property taxes and other expenses. These tenant reimbursements and rent payments are treated as a single lease component because the timing and pattern of revenue recognition is the same. This means that rental income is equal in all periods of the lease, calculated by adding all expected lease payments (including increases within the lease) and dividing by the number of periods, despite the cash rents being received in lump sums at the specific times as described above. The lease term generally considers periods when a tenant: (1) may not terminate its lease obligation early; (2) may terminate its lease obligation early in exchange for a fee or penalty that the Company considers material enough such that termination would not be probable; (3) possesses renewal rights and the tenant s failure to exercise such rights imposes a penalty on the tenant material enough such that renewal appears reasonably assured; or (4) possesses bargain renewal options for such periods. Payments received in advance are included in deferred revenue until they are earned. Variable Rent: Certain of the Company s leases provide for a rent payment determined as a percentage of the gross farm proceeds in their entirety or above a certain threshold. Revenue under leases providing for variable rent may be recorded at the guaranteed crop insurance minimums and recognized ratably over the lease term during the crop year. Upon notification from the grain or packing facility that a future contract for delivery of the harvest has been finalized or when the tenant has notified the Company of the total amount of gross farm proceeds, revenue is recognized for the excess of the actual gross farm proceeds and the previously recognized minimum guaranteed insurance. Fixed Rent and Variable Rent: Certain of the Company s leases provide for a minimum fixed rent plus variable rent based on gross farm revenue.

 Solar, Wind and Recreation Rent Tenant Reimbursements Variable Rent The Company s leases generally have terms ranging from one to , with some extending up to (e.g., renewable energy leases).

Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 included a deferred gain of approximately million in connection with the sale of properties that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2023, whereby the Company provided approximately million of seller financing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company collected the seller financing and recognized the gain on sale of approximately million. The majority of the Company s revenue is derived from rental income. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for both its lease and non-lease components (specifically, tenant reimbursements) as a single lease component under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842, Lease Accounting. The following sets forth a summary of rental income recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Leases entered into during the year Future minimum fixed rent payments from tenants under all non-cancelable leases in place as of September 30, 2024, including lease advances when contractually due, but excluding crop share and tenant reimbursement of expenses, for the remainder of 2024 and each of the next four years and thereafter as of September 30, 2024 are as follows: 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Since lease renewal periods are exercisable at the option of the lessee, the preceding table presents future minimum lease payments due during the initial lease term only. Crop Sales: For farms directly operated through the TRS, the Company records revenue from the sale of harvested crops when the harvested crop has been contracted to be delivered to a grain or packing facility and title has transferred. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenues from the sale of harvested crops recognized were million and million, respectively. Revenues from the sale of harvested crops recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively. The cost of harvested crops sold was million and million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the

 million and million, respectively. Harvested crops are recorded using the market price at the date the harvested crop is delivered to the grain or packing facility and title has transferred. Other Revenue: Other revenue includes crop insurance proceeds, auction fees, brokerage fees, interest income, and property management income. Crop insurance proceeds are recognized when the amount is determinable and collectible. Crop insurance proceeds are generally received in lieu of crop sales on farms directly operated through the TRS. The Company generates auction revenue by contracting with a real estate owner to market and auction farm property. Successful bidders sign a purchase agreement immediately following the auction. Auction fee revenue is recognized upon completion of the auction. The Company generates real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for real estate investors or owners seeking to buy or sell farm property. Revenue from brokerage fees is recognized upon completion of the transaction. Property management revenue is recognized over the term of the contract as services are being provided. The Company collects property management fees in advance of the commencement of property management activities on behalf of third parties and includes them in deferred revenue until they are earned over the life of the contract. Interest income is recognized on loans and financing receivables on an accrual basis over the life of the loans. Direct origination costs are netted against loan origination fees and are amortized over the life of the note using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, as an adjustment to interest income which is included as a component of other revenue in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following table presents other revenue that is disaggregated by revenue source for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Crop insurance proceeds Property management income Other (e.g., interest income) tenant representing million of rental income, or . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had no significant tenants representing a tenant concentration of 10 or greater of rental income. Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue for the entire year ending December 31, 2024. The Company receives a significant portion of its variable rental payments in the fourth quarter of each year, typically resulting in at least one tenant concentration of 10 or greater of revenue in that quarter and for the year. If a significant tenant fails to make rental payments to the Company or elects to terminate its leases, and the land cannot be re-leased on satisfactory terms, there may be a material adverse effect on the Company s financial performance.

Certain Sabrepoint defendants had prevailed previously on a motion to dismiss the case against them in the Rota Fortunae action in the United State District Court for the District of Colorado (where the state case had been removed) solely on personal jurisdiction grounds. On December 17, 2021, the Company's claims against Sabrepoint in Texas were dismissed by the trial court, which granted (i) Sabrepoint's motion for summary judgment on collateral estoppel grounds, and (ii) motion to dismiss pursuant to the Texas Citizens Participation Act TCPA ).

Accordingly, the Company narrowed its appeal to the trial court's grant of summary judgment. On January 26, 2022, Sabrepoint filed a motion for attorney's fees relating to the defense of that action. The trial court granted the motion for certain fees claimed by Sabrepoint as relating to its pursuit of its TCPA motion, but as noted above, the Court of Appeals subsequently overturned the TCPA order that formed the basis of Sabrepoint s fee request, mooting the motion and the Court s order on the same. On June 30, 2023, the Court of Appeals granted the Company s appeal, determining that the Company s claims against Sabrepoint are not barred, reversing the trial court and remanding the case for further proceedings on the merits. On October 13, 2023, Sabrepoint filed a Petition for Review with the Texas Supreme Court, requesting the court to review the Court of Appeals decision. The Company filed a response to the Sabrepoint Petition for Review with the Texas Supreme Court on December 27, 2023, and Sabrepoint filed a reply in support of its petition on January 25, 2024. Sabrepoint's appeal is now fully briefed and pending a decision by the court. The Company remains confident that it will ultimately be permitted to proceed with its claims against Sabrepoint. Repurchase Options For certain of the Company s acquisitions, the seller retains the option to repurchase the property at a future date for a price, which is calculated based on an appreciation factor over the original purchase price plus the value of improvements on the property, that, at the time of the acquisition, the Company expected would be at or above the property s fair market value at the exercise date.

The non-controlling interests in the Operating Partnership consist of both the Common units and the Series A preferred units held by third parties. Common Units in Operating Partnership, OP Units On or after the 12-month anniversary of becoming a holder of Common units, unless the terms of an agreement with such Common unitholder dictate otherwise, each limited partner, other than the Company, has the right, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, as amended (the Partnership Agreement ), to tender for redemption all or a portion of such Common units in exchange for cash, or in the Company s sole discretion, for shares of the Company s common stock on a -for-one basis. If cash is paid in satisfaction of a redemption request, the amount will be equal to the number of tendered units multiplied by the fair market value per share of the Company s common stock on the date of the redemption notice (determined in accordance with, and subject to adjustment under, the terms of the Partnership Agreement). Any redemption request must be satisfied by the Company on or before the close of business on the tenth business day after the Company receives a notice of redemption. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were redemptions of Common units.

There were approximately million outstanding Common units eligible to be tendered for redemption as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. If the Company gives the limited partners notice of its intention to make an extraordinary distribution of cash or property to its stockholders or effect a merger, a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or any other similar extraordinary transaction, each limited partner may exercise its right to tender its Common units for redemption, regardless of the length of time such limited partner has held its Common units. Regardless of the rights described above, the Operating Partnership will not have an obligation to issue cash to a unitholder upon a redemption request if the Company elects to redeem Common units for shares of common stock. When a Common unit is redeemed, non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership is reduced, and stockholders equity is increased. The Operating Partnership intends to continue to make distributions on each Common unit in the same amount as those paid on each share of FPI s common stock, with the distributions on the Common units held by FPI being utilized to pay dividends to FPI s common stockholders. Pursuant to the consolidation accounting standard with respect to the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interest changes and changes in ownership interest of a subsidiary, changes in the parent s ownership interest when the parent retains controlling interest in the subsidiary should be accounted for as equity transactions.

All Common units received upon conversion may be immediately tendered for redemption for cash or, at the Company s option, for shares of common stock on a -for-one basis, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Partnership Agreement. Prior to the Conversion Right Date, the Series A preferred units may not be tendered for redemption by the Holder.

In the event of a Termination Transaction (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) prior to conversion, holders of the Series A preferred units generally have the right to receive the same consideration as holders of Common units and common stock, on an as-converted basis. Holders of the Series A preferred units have no voting rights except with respect to (i) the issuance of partnership units of the Operating Partnership senior to the Series A preferred units as to the right to receive distributions and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Operating Partnership, (ii) the issuance of additional Series A preferred units and (iii) amendments to the Partnership Agreement that materially and adversely affect the rights or benefits of the holders of the Series A preferred units.

Equity Incentive Plan On May 7, 2021, the Company s stockholders approved the Third Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the Plan ), which increased the aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan to approximately million shares. As of September 30, 2024, there were million shares available for future grants under the Plan. The Company may issue equity-based awards to officers, non-employee directors, employees, independent contractors and other eligible persons under the Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options, share awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock units), stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance awards, annual incentive cash awards and other equity-based awards, including LTIP units, which are convertible on a -for-one basis into Common units. The terms of each grant are determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors. From time to time, the Company may award time-based and performance-based restricted shares of its common stock under the Plan, as compensation to officers, employees, non-employee directors and non-employee consultants. The shares of restricted stock vest generally over a period of time and/or upon the achievement of certain performance conditions, as applicable, as determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors at the date of grant. Performance-based restricted shares are based upon the Company s total shareholder return measured on an absolute basis, and relative to an index, and are subject to continued employment. The number of shares of common stock that may be ultimately earned following the end of the cumulative performance period ranges from to of the target number of performance-based restricted shares granted. The Company recognizes compensation expense for awards issued to officers, employees and non-employee directors for restricted shares of common stock on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based upon the fair market value of the shares on the date of issuance, adjusted for forfeitures. The Company recognizes compensation expense for awards issued to non-employee consultants in the same period and in the same manner as if the Company paid cash for the underlying services. A summary of the non-vested restricted shares as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: Granted Vested ) Forfeited ) Unvested at September 30, 2023 Unvested at December 31, 2023 Granted Vested ) Forfeited Unvested at September 30, 2024 The grant-date fair values of performance-based restricted shares were based on specified absolute and relative total stockholder return goals measured over a performance period. The Company used Monte Carlo simulations, which use a probabilistic approach for estimating the fair values of the awards. Expected volatilities were derived from the volatility of the historical prices of the Company and the comparative index. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the yield available for zero-coupon U.S. government securities with remaining terms corresponding to the service periods of the performance-based restricted shares. A dividend yield was based on historical dividend yields for the Company and the comparative index.

The weighted average number of Common units held by the non-controlling interests was million during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Numerator: Unvested shares of the Company s restricted common stock are considered participating securities, which requires the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Accordingly, distributed and undistributed earnings attributable to unvested restricted shares (participating securities) may be subtracted, as applicable, from net income or loss attributable to common stockholders utilized in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Denominator: The outstanding Series A preferred units are non-participating securities and thus are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share on an as-if-converted basis if they are dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, these shares were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation as they would have been anti-dilutive.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the entire change in the fair value of the Company s designated cash flow hedges is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. On March 26, 2020, the Company terminated its existing swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement to obtain a more favorable interest rate and to manage interest rate risk exposure, which was effective April 1, 2020. An interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company effectively modified the Company s exposure to interest rate risk by converting the Company s floating-rate debt to a fixed rate basis for the next on of the outstanding amount to Rabobank at the time of the agreement, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. This agreement involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. The fair value of the de-designated swap was million on the termination date. The Company amortized the de-designated swap over the original term utilizing a forward curve analysis of determining monthly amortization out of Other Comprehensive Income through the original termination date (March 1, 2023). During each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, amortization was million. Amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. The Company s million termination fee was rolled into the new swap and will be paid through March 1, 2026. Termination fees paid during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million. Termination fees paid during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million. The Company determines the hedge effectiveness of its interest rate swaps at inception by applying a quantitative evaluation of effectiveness using regression analysis. On an ongoing basis the Company applies an initial qualitative assessment of on-going effectiveness and reviews hedge effectiveness through assessing the hedge relationship by comparing the current terms of the swap and the associated debt to ensure they continue to coincide through the continued ability of the Counterparty to the swap to honor its obligations under the swap contract. The qualitative assessment may indicate that the hedge relationship is not highly effective, the Company would then perform a quantitative evaluation using regression analysis. The Company concluded the hedge was highly effective at inception and remained highly effective as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the total notional amount of the Company s receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate swap was million.

The fair values of the Company s interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts, which is considered a Level 2 measurement under the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 is defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.

Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the TRS s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. Because of the TRS s recent history of operating losses, and management s inability to accurately project future taxable income, management believes that recognition of the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits is currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a valuation allowance.

Some factors that might cause such a difference include the following: the ongoing war in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and their impacts on our tenants businesses and the farm economy generally, changes in trade policies in the United States and other countries that import U.S. agricultural products, high inflation and elevated interest rates, the onset of an economic recession in the United States and other countries that impact the farm economy, extreme weather events, such as droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes or floods, the impact of future public health crises on our business and on the economy and capital markets generally, general volatility of the capital markets and the market price of our common stock, changes in our business strategy, availability, terms and deployment of capital, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at or prior to maturity on favorable terms, or at all, availability of qualified personnel, changes in our industry or the general economy, the degree and nature of our competition, the outcomes of ongoing litigation, our ability to identify new acquisitions or dispositions and close on pending acquisitions or dispositions and the other factors described in the risk factors described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. Given these uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by law. Overview and Background Our primary strategic objective is to utilize our position as a leading institutional acquirer, owner and manager of high-quality farmland located in agricultural markets throughout North America to deliver strong risk adjusted returns to investors through a combination of cash dividends and asset appreciation. As of September 30, 2024, we owned farms with an aggregate of approximately 134,700 acres in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we owned land and buildings for four agriculture equipment dealerships in Ohio leased to Ag Pro under the John Deere brand and served as property manager for approximately 47,800 acres, including farms in Iowa. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 70 of our portfolio (by value) was used to grow primary crops, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton, and approximately 30 was used to produce specialty crops, such as almonds, pistachios, citrus, strawberries, and edible beans. We believe our portfolio gives investors the economic benefit of increasing global

Table of Contents 
 food demand in the face of growing scarcity of high-quality farmland and will continue to reflect the approximate allocation of U.S. agricultural output between primary crops and animal protein (whose production relies principally on primary crops as feed), on one hand, and specialty crops, on the other. On October 16, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries sold to Farmland Reserve, Inc., a Utah nonprofit corporation Farmland Reserve a portfolio of 46 farms comprising 41,554 acres of farmland located in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, North Carolina and South Carolina for an aggregate purchase price of 289 million in a single, all-cash transaction (the Farmland Reserve Transaction ). Approximately 189.4 million of the proceeds from the Farmland Reserve Transaction were used to pay down indebtedness of the Company that carried a weighted average interest rate of 5.77 , which the Company projects will save approximately 10.9 million in annual interest cost. The Company expects to use the remaining proceeds from the sale to (i) fund a special distribution to shareholders after year-end 2024, (ii) repay additional indebtedness and/or repurchase Company shares, and/or (iii) purchase additional farms that management believes are accretive to long-term value creation. In addition, under the FPI Loan Program, we make loans to third-party farmers (both tenant and non-tenant) to provide financing for property acquisitions, working capital requirements, operational farming activities, farming infrastructure projects and for other farming and agricultural real estate related projects. FPI was incorporated in Maryland on September 27, 2013, and is the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, which is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed on September 27, 2013. All of FPI s assets are held by, and its operations are primarily conducted through, the Operating Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, FPI owned 97.5 of the Common units and none of the Series A preferred units. See Note 9 Stockholders Equity and Non-controlling Interests within the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the non-controlling interests. FPI has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its short taxable year ended December 31, 2014. The following table sets forth our ownership of acreage by region as of September 30, 2024: 

Region (1) Owned Acres (2) Managed Acres Total Acres Corn Belt (3) 46,414 28,956 75,370 Delta and South 26,427 8,763 35,190 High Plains 21,831 4,352 26,183 Southeast 28,825 5,772 34,597 West Coast 11,189 11,189 134,686 47,843 182,529 

 (1) Corn Belt includes farms located in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and eastern Nebraska. Delta and South includes farms located in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma. High Plains includes farms located in Colorado, Kansas and Texas. Southeast includes farms located in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. West Coast includes farms located in California. (2) Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company sold 46,316 acres of farmland under two transactions. The acres sold were primarily in the Delta and South and Southeast regions. (3) In addition, we own land and buildings for four agriculture equipment dealerships in Ohio leased to Ag Pro under the John Deere brand. We intend to continue acquiring additional farmland that we believe provides opportunities for risk-adjusted investment returns consistent with our primary strategic objective. We also intend to continue to selectively dispose of assets when we believe we can redeploy the proceeds from such sales in a manner that enhances stockholder returns. We also may acquire, and make loans secured by mortgages on, properties related to farming, such as grain storage facilities, grain elevators, feedlots, processing plants and distribution centers, as well as livestock farms or ranches. In addition, we provide volume purchasing services to our tenants, engage directly in farming, and provide property management, auction, and brokerage services through FPI Agribusiness Inc., our taxable REIT subsidiary (the TRS or FPI Agribusiness ). As of September 30, 2024, the TRS directly operated 2,103 acres of farmland located in California. Our principal source of revenue is rent from tenants that conduct farming operations on our farmland. The majority of the leases that are in place as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have fixed rent payments. Some of our 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 leases have variable rents based on the revenue generated by our farm-operator tenants. We believe that this mix of fixed and variable rents will help insulate us from the variability of farming operations and reduce our credit-risk exposure to farm-operator tenants while making us an attractive landlord in certain regions where variable leases are customary. However, we may be exposed to tenant credit risk and farming operation risks, particularly with respect to leases that do not require advance payment of 100 of the fixed rent, variable rent arrangements and leases with terms greater than one year. In addition, for leases that provide for variable rent payments, we may recognize revenue up to the amount of the crop insurance minimum. The excess above crop insurance minimums cannot be recognized as revenue until the tenant enters into a contract to sell their crop. Generally, we expect tenants to enter into contracts to sell their crop following the harvest of the crop. Impact of the War in Ukraine Food prices were near record highs even before the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine and the Russian Federation represent large portions of global trade in a variety of agricultural products (e.g., 34 of global wheat exports, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute). The disruption in farming operations in Ukraine, and trade from the Black Sea region has stressed the food supply for many countries that depend on imports of agricultural products from the region, such as Egypt (wheat for food products) and China (corn for livestock). The Russian Federation is also a major exporter of fertilizers and trade restrictions have hampered the flow of fertilizers to countries dependent on imports from the Black Sea region. United States farmers, including our tenants, however, generally source fertilizers from the United States and Canada. Inflation and Interest Rates Most of our farming leases have lease terms of three years for row crops and up to seven years for permanent crops, pursuant to which each tenant is responsible for substantially all of the operating expenses related to the property, including maintenance, water usage and insurance. As a result, we believe that the effect on us of inflationary increases in operating expenses are borne largely by our tenants under the terms of their leases, and inflationary increases in farmer profitability generally lead to increased rents upon lease renewals, as we experienced in the most recent renewal cycle in late 2023. Furthermore, high levels of inflation prompted the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve (the Federal Reserve to increase the federal funds rate (the rate the Federal Reserve charges member banks for overnight funds) eleven times between March 2022 and July 2023, which led to a significant increase in market short- and long-term interest rates beginning in early 2022. This increase in rates has significantly increased the cost of our floating rate debt and has also significantly increased the cost of certain of our MetLife debt with interest rates that have been reset since the beginning of 2022. However, we have recently repaid most of our floating rate debt with the proceeds of the Farmland Reserve Transaction. Moreover, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate in September 2024, and has signaled the possibility of future rate cuts, which we anticipate will have a favorable impact on the cost of debt for the Company moving forward. However, interest rates remain high, and there can be no certainty as to the occurrence, timing or magnitude of future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations and Farmland Values The principal factors affecting our operating results and the value of our farmland include long-term global demand for food relative to the global supply of food; farmland fundamentals and economic conditions in the markets in which we own farmland; and our ability to increase or maintain rental revenues while controlling expenses. We are currently in an environment of appreciating land values, driven by, among other things, inflation, strong commodity prices (further exacerbated by the war in Ukraine) and an outlook for high levels of farmer profitability. Sustained high interest rates can serve as a counter-balancing external factor to this favorable environment. Each year additional farmland in various portions of the world, including the United States, is repurposed for commercial development, thus decreasing the land acreage available for production of grains, oil seeds, permanent and specialty crops necessary to feed the world s growing population. Although farmland prices may show a decline from time to time, we believe that any reduction in U.S. farmland 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 values overall is likely to be short-lived as global demand for food and agricultural commodities typically exceeds global supply and quality farmland becomes scarcer. Food Demand We expect that global demand for food, driven primarily by significant increases in the gross domestic product GDP per capita and global population, will continue to be the key driver of farmland values. We expect that global demand for most crops will continue to keep pace with global population growth. We also believe that growth in global GDP per capita, particularly in developing nations, will contribute significantly to increasing demand for primary crops. As global GDP per capita increases, the composition of daily caloric intake is expected to shift away from the direct consumption of primary crops toward more fruits, vegetables and animal-based proteins, which is expected to result in increased demand for primary crops as feed for livestock. We believe that once individuals increase consumption of higher quality food, they will strongly resist returning to their former dietary habits, resulting in greater inelasticity in the demand for food. We anticipate these factors will lead to either higher crop prices and/or higher yields and, therefore, higher rental rates on our farmland, as well as sustained growth in farmland values over the long term. In addition, global demand for corn and soybeans as inputs in the production of biofuels such as ethanol and soy-based diesel also could impact the prices of corn and soybeans, which, in the long term, could impact our rental revenues and our results of operations. However, we believe that growth in GDP per capita and global population will be more significant drivers of global demand for primary crops over the long term. Despite advances in income, according to The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024, a report by the UN FAO, 2.33 billion people were facing moderate to severe food insecurity in 2023. The ongoing war in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains and affected the prices of grain, fertilizer, and energy, further stressing food supplies for developing countries that are dependent on food imports. Farmland Supply According to the World Bank Group arable land per capita has decreased by approximately 50 from 1961 to 2021, further exacerbated by international conflicts, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine. Typically, additions to cropland are in areas of marginal productivity, while cropland loss, driven by urban development, tends to affect primarily highly productive areas. According to a study published in 2017 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, urban expansion is expected to take place on cropland that is 1.77 times more productive than the global average. The global supply of food is also impacted by the productivity per acre of arable land. Historically, productivity gains (measured by average crop yields) have been driven by advances in seed technology, farm equipment, irrigation techniques, and improvements in soil health, chemical nutrients and pest control. On the other hand, we expect the shortage of water in many irrigated growing regions in the United States and around the globe, often as a result of new water restrictions imposed by laws or regulations, to lead to decreased productivity on those acres. Conditions in Our Existing Markets Our portfolio is broadly diversified across numerous farmland markets and crop types. Across all regions, farmland acquisitions continue to be dominated by buyers who are existing farm owners and operators, whereas institutional investors constitute a small fraction of the industry (less than 5 of total farmland in the United States). We generally see firm demand for high quality properties across all regions and crop types. Farmland values are typically very stable, often showing modest increases even in years of commodity price weakness. We expect this trend to continue, with modest but consistent annual increases that compound into significant appreciation in the long term. Under certain market conditions, as in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with strong commodity prices and farmer profitability, there are periods of accelerating appreciation in farmland values. Leases renegotiated under the robust market conditions experienced in 2021, 2022, and 2023 reflected significant rent increases. While the pace of appreciation and transaction volume slowed in 2023 and early 2024, these metrics remain strong relative to long-term trends.

Table of Contents 
 We believe quality farmland in the United States has a near-zero vacancy rate as a result of the supply and demand fundamentals discussed above. We believe that due to the relatively high fixed costs associated with farming operations (including equipment, labor and knowledge), many farm operators choose to rent additional acres of farmland when it becomes available in order to allocate their fixed costs over additional acres. Our view is that rental rates for farmland are a function of farmland operators view of the long-term profitability of farmland, and that many farm operators will compete for farmland even during periods of decreased profitability due to the scarcity of farmland available to rent. Furthermore, because it is generally customary in the industry to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to re-lease the land at the end of each lease term, we believe that many farm operators will rent additional land that becomes available in order to control the ability to farm that land in future periods. As a result, in our experience, many farm operators will aggressively pursue rental opportunities in their operable geographic area, even when the farmer anticipates lower profits returns or even short-term losses. As we move into an environment with lower grain prices, combined with higher interest rates, we are monitoring the financial health and liquidity of our tenants. Lease Expirations Farm leases are generally one to three years in duration. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio had the following lease expirations as a percentage of approximate acres leased and annual minimum fixed rents: 

in thousands) Year Ending December 31, Approximate Acres (1) of Approximate Acres (1) Annual Fixed Rents (1) of Annual Fixed Rents (1) 2024 (remaining three months) 40,314 29.9 11,654 32.1 2025 20,287 15.1 5,596 15.5 2026 45,983 34.1 10,374 28.7 2027 15,445 11.5 4,787 13.2 2028 91 0.1 59 0.2 Thereafter 12,566 9.3 3,728 10.3 134,686 100.0 36,198 100.0 
 (1) Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company sold 46,316 acres of farmland under two transactions. The acres sold were primarily in the Delta and South and Southeast regions. Rental Revenues Our revenues are primarily generated from renting farmland to operators of farming businesses. Our leases generally have terms ranging from one to three years, with some extending up to 40 years (e.g., renewable energy leases). Although the majority of our leases do not provide the tenant with a contractual right to renew the lease upon its expiration, we believe it is customary to provide the existing tenant with the opportunity to renew the lease, subject to any increase in the rental rate that we may establish. If the tenant elects not to renew the lease at the end of the lease term, the land will be offered to a new tenant. As discussed above, the vacancy rate for quality U.S. farmland is near-zero and there is often competition among prospective tenants for quality farmland; accordingly, we do not believe that re-leasing farmland upon the expiration of existing leases is a significant risk for the Company. The leases for the majority of the row-crop properties in our portfolio provide that tenants pay us, typically, 50 of their fixed farm rent in advance of each spring planting season. As a result, we collect a significant portion of total annual rents in the first calendar quarter of each year, which we believe mitigates the tenant credit risk associated with the variability of farming operations that could be adversely impacted by poor crop yields, weather conditions, mismanagement, undercapitalization or other factors affecting our tenants. Tenant credit risk is further mitigated by the farming industry practice of purchasing crop insurance in almost every circumstance because it is required by lenders who provide working capital financing to our tenants and due to requirements in our leases. In certain cases, the Company perfects its security interest in the crop insurance proceeds and the underlying growing crops using practices applicable in the state where the farm is located. Prior to acquiring farmland property, we take into consideration the competitiveness of the local farm-operator tenant environment in order to enhance our ability to quickly replace a tenant that is unwilling to renew a lease or is unable to pay a rent payment when it is due. Many of our leases provide for the reimbursement by the tenant of the property s real estate taxes that we pay in connection with the farms they rent from us. 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 Expenses Substantially all of our farm leases are structured in such a way that we are responsible for major maintenance expenses, certain liability and casualty insurance and taxes (which are sometimes reimbursed to us by our tenants), while our tenant is responsible for operating expenses, minor maintenance, water usage and all of the additional input costs related to farming operations on the property, such as seed, fertilizer, labor and fuel. We expect leases for farmland we acquire in the future will contain similar features related to expenses. As the owner of the land, we generally only bear costs related to major capital improvements permanently attached to the property, such as irrigation systems, drainage tile, grain storage facilities, permanent plantings or other physical structures customary for farms. In cases where capital expenditures are necessary, we typically seek to offset, over a period of multiple years, the costs of such capital expenditures by increasing rental rates. We incur costs associated with running a public company, including, among others, costs associated with our personnel, Board of Directors, compliance, legal and accounting, due diligence and acquisitions (including, among others, travel expenses and consulting fees). Inflation in personnel costs, which is impacting many United States businesses, is also likely to impact our expenses. We also incur costs associated with managing farmland assets. The management of our farmland, generally, has significant economies of scale, as farmland generally has minimal physical structures that require routine inspection and maintenance, and our leases, generally, are structured to require the tenant to pay many of the operating expenses associated with the property. We do not expect the expenses associated with managing our portfolio of farmland to increase significantly as the number of farm properties we own increases over time. Crop Prices While many people assume that short-term crop prices have a great impact on farm values, we believe that long-term farmer profitability and revenue per acre, expressed as crop prices multiplied by crop yield, is a much more significant driver of farm value. Crop yield trends in corn and soybeans have been steadily increasing over the last thirty years. After yields for the 2022/2023 marketing year (September 2022 to August 2023) decreased slightly for both corn and soybeans compared to the previous year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects yields to increase slightly for the 2023/2024 marketing year (September 2023 to August 2024). Short-term crop price changes have had little effect historically on farmland values. They also have a limited impact on our rental revenue, as most of our leases provide for fixed farm rents, a common approach in agricultural markets, especially with respect to row crops. Fixed farm rent significantly simplifies the administrative requirements for the landlord and the tenant, as farmers benefit from the fundamental revenue hedging that occurs when large crop yields mitigate the effect of lower crop prices. Similarly, lower crop yields have a tendency to trigger higher crop prices and help increase revenue even when confronted by lower crop yields. Such hedging effect also limits the impact of short-term crop price changes on revenues generated by leases with a variable rent component based on farm revenues. Further risk mitigation is available to tenants, and indirectly to us, via crop insurance and hedging programs implemented by tenants. Our TRS also takes advantage of these risk mitigation programs and strategies with respect to the properties it directly operates. Crop prices are affected by many factors that can differ on a yearly basis. Weather conditions and crop diseases can create a significant risk of price volatility. Changes in government regulations and policy, fluctuations in global prosperity, fluctuations in foreign trade and export markets and eruptions of military conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, or civil unrest also impact crop prices. Interest Rates The Federal Reserve engaged in a series of significant increases in the federal funds rate between March 2022 and July 2023. The federal funds rate is the rate the Federal Reserve charges member banks for overnight funds. Changes to the federal funds rate affect all borrowing rates, and for variable rate debt and debt with rates that reset periodically, such changes have a direct and relatively immediate impact. The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate from recent highs in September 2024 and has signaled the possibility of further rate cuts, but interest rates remain high, and there can be no certainty as to the occurrence, timing or magnitude of future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

 As of September 30, 2024, 136.0 million of our outstanding indebtedness was subject to interest rates that reset before maturity (excluding our floating rate debt). As of January 1, 2024, 43.9 million was subject to rate resets in 2024. 16.8 million has been reset as of September 30, 2024, of which 8.4 million was repaid in October 2024. The remaining 27.1 million that was scheduled to reset in the fourth quarter was also subsequently repaid. At September 30, 2024, 111.4 million, or 28.3 , of our debt had variable interest rates, however, as stated in Note 10 Hedge Accounting to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has an interest rate swap with Rabobank for 33.2 million, which reduces floating rate exposure to 78.2 million. After adjusting the 33.2 million of swapped Rabobank debt as fixed rate debt, the ratio of floating rate debt to total debt decreased to 19.8 . Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we have repaid most of our floating rate debt with the proceeds of the Farmland Reserve Transaction. After these repayments, 11.8 million, or 5.7 , of our debt had variable interest rates. However, the Company amended its existing swap agreement to adjust the total notional amount of the Company s receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate swap from 33.2 million to 11.8 million, effectively reducing our floating rate exposure to 0. We expect that future changes in interest rates will impact our overall operating performance by, among other things, affecting our borrowing costs and borrowing costs of our tenants. While we may seek to manage our exposure to future changes in rates through interest rate swap agreements or interest rate caps, portions of our overall outstanding debt will likely remain at floating rates or subject to interest rates that reset periodically. In addition, if interest rates begin to rise again, farmland prices may decline if the rise in real interest rates (nominal interest rates minus the inflation rate) is not accompanied by rises in the general levels of inflation. However, our business model anticipates that over time the value of our farmland will increase, as it has in the past, at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of inflation, which may in part offset the impact of rising interest rates on the value of our farmland, but there can be no guarantee that this appreciation will occur to the extent that we anticipate or at all. International Trade After a 34 increase in exports of corn for the 2023/2024 marketing year (September 2023 to August 2024), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the USDA estimates corn exports will remain flat for the 2024/2025 marketing year (September 2024 to August 2025). After a 15 decrease in exports of soybeans for the 2023/2024 marketing year, the USDA estimates soybean exports will be up 7 for the 2024/2025 marketing year, due to less competition from South American production. According to the USDA Outlook for Agricultural Trade, the top three export countries from the United States were China, Mexico, and Canada. Exports to China for fiscal year 2023 (October 2022 to September 2023) were 33.7 billion, down 7 from 2022. Exports to Canada were 27.9 billion, down 3 from 2022. Exports to Mexico were 28.2 billion, up 1 from 2022. Exports to China for fiscal year 2024 are forecast to decrease to 27.7 billion, while exports to Mexico and Canada are expected to increase slightly to 28.7 billion and 28.4 billion, respectively.

Rental income decreased 0.4 million, or 3.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting primarily from dispositions that occurred in 2023. Crop sales totaled 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was the result of a higher volume of citrus sales on our directly operated properties. Other revenue increased 0.3 million, or 42.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in auction and brokerage income, property management income and interest income as a result of a higher average balance outstanding on loans under the FPI Loan Program. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased 0.5 million, or 25.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was a result of asset dispositions in 2023 and more assets becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by depreciable assets being placed into service.

 Property operating expenses decreased 0.1 million, or 6.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from lower insurance and repairs. Cost of goods sold totaled 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily the result of a higher volume of citrus sold in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at 2.6 million and 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Legal and accounting expenses remained relatively flat at 0.5 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Impairment of assets decreased 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was the result of a property classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2023 that was written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Other operating expenses were negligible during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and remained relatively consistent compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income remained relatively flat at 0.1 million and 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income from equity method investment was negligible during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and remained relatively consistent compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gain on disposition of assets decreased 8.3 million, or 80.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gain on sale of assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the recognition of gains from the sale of two properties in 2023 that had previously been deferred and the disposal of fixed assets, while the gain on sale of assets during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to dispositions of 35 properties, as well as the disposal of fixed assets. Interest expense decreased 0.7 million, or 11.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was the result of lower outstanding debt, partially offset by higher interest rates. Income tax (benefit) expense changed from income tax benefit of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to income tax expense of less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 .

Rental income decreased 1.6 million, or 5.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting primarily from dispositions that occurred in 2023. Crop sales increased 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was the result of a higher volume of walnut and citrus sales on our directly operated properties. Other revenue remained relatively flat at 3.0 million and 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased 1.6 million, or 26.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Acquisition and due diligence costs were negligible during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and remained relatively consistent compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses increased 0.8 million, or 10.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by a one-time severance expense of 1.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by lower compensation and travel expense. The severance expense was incurred in connection with the previously announced departure of the Company s former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer as part of the Company's cost-cutting initiative. Legal and accounting expenses increased 0.3 million, or 34.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Despite this percentage increase, legal and accounting expense continues to be substantially lower than in the past and a very manageable element of the Company s expense structure. Impairment of assets decreased 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was the result of a property classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2023 that was written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Other operating expenses remained relatively flat at 0.0 million and 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other (income) expense changed from other expense of less than 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to other income of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This change is primarily due to proceeds related to an easement, partially offset by a loss on debt modification due to the amendment of the Rutledge Facility. (Income) loss from equity method investment changed from loss from equity method investment of 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to income from equity method investment of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Gain on disposition of assets, net decreased 21.3 million, or 91.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain on sale of assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the recognition of gains from the sale of two properties in 2023 that had previously been deferred and the disposal of fixed assets, while the gain on sale of assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to dispositions of 54 properties, as well as the disposal of fixed assets. (Income) from forfeited deposits was 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the termination of a repurchase agreement and the retention of 1.2 million in earnest money payments. Interest expense decreased 1.2 million, or 7.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was the result of lower outstanding debt, partially offset by higher interest rates. Income tax (benefit) expense changed from income tax benefit of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to income tax expense of less than 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay any outstanding borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, acquire new properties, make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders, and fund other general business needs. High levels of inflation prompted the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates between March 2022 and July 2023, which has resulted in increased interest expense. The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate from recent highs in September 2024 and has signaled the possibility of further rate cuts, but interest rates remain high, and there can be no certainty as to the occurrence, timing or magnitude of future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. We expect to meet our liquidity needs through cash on hand, undrawn availability under our lines of credit 132.1 million in availability as of September 30, 2024 and 168.9 million as of the date of this report), operating cash flows, borrowings, proceeds from equity issuances and selective asset dispositions where such dispositions are deemed to be in the best interests of the Company. On May 6, 2022, we entered into equity distribution agreements under which we issued and sold from time to time, through sales agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 100.0 million in an at-the-market offering program (the ATM Program ). The ATM Program was intended to provide cost-effective financing alternatives in the capital markets. The ATM Program expired on April 9, 2024 in connection with the expiration of the Company s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-254834) (the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement ). On May 8, 2024, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279210), which was declared effective by the SEC on May 17, 2024 (the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement ), pursuant to which we may issue and sell additional equity or debt securities. The Company does not currently have an at-the-market offering program, but may enter into a new equity distribution agreement in the future pursuant to which sales may be made under the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we completed 52 farm dispositions under two transactions for aggregate consideration of approximately 308.0 million. Approximately 189.4 million of the proceeds were used to pay down indebtedness that carried a weighted average interest rate of 5.77 , which we project will save approximately 10.9 million in annual interest cost. We expect to use the remaining proceeds from the sale to (i) fund a special distribution to shareholders after year-end 2024, (ii) repay additional indebtedness and/or repurchase shares, and/or (iii) purchase additional farms that we believe are accretive to long-term value creation. Our ability to incur additional debt will depend on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets, compliance with the covenants under our existing debt agreements, borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders and the conditions of debt markets. When material debt repayments are due within the following 12 months, we work with current and new lenders and other potential sources of capital sufficiently in advance of the debt maturity to ensure that all of our obligations are satisfied in a timely manner. We have a history of being able to refinance or extend our debt obligations to manage our debt maturities. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will depend on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions. The Company has 25.0 million in debt maturities due within the next 12 months. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased no shares of our common stock. We currently have authority to repurchase up to an aggregate of 83.3 million in additional shares of our common stock. Consolidated Indebtedness For further details relating to our consolidated indebtedness as of September 30, 2024, refer to Note 7 Mortgage Notes, Line of Credit and Bonds Payable included in the financial statement section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities decreased by 4.2 million primarily as a result of the following: Receipt of 21.7 million in fixed rent, 1.0 million in variable rent and 2.9 million in tenant reimbursements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the receipt of 28.7 million in fixed rent, 1.9 million in variable rent, and 2.0 million in tenant reimbursements for the nine months ended September 30, 2023; Stock-based compensation and incentive expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.9 million as compared to 1.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; A change in depreciation, depletion and amortization of 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023; (Gain) loss on disposition of assets, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.9 million as compared to 23.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; Income from forfeited deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.2 million as compared to 0.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; A change in accounts receivable of (2.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023; A change in accrued expenses of (3.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (2.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and A change in deferred revenue of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) investing activities decreased by 106.6 million primarily as a result of the following: Property acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 16.3 million as compared to 20.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 ; Dispositions of fixed assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for cash consideration of 1.5 million as compared to 121.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for 54 property dispositions; A decrease of 3.0 million in real estate improvements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023; Collections on notes receivable under the FPI Loan Program and financing receivables of 10.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and

 Issuances of notes receivable under the FPI Loan Program and financing receivables of 1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) financing activities increased by 115.0 million primarily as a result of the following: Borrowings from mortgage notes payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 81.0 million as compared to 77.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; Repayments on mortgage notes payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 50.1 million as compared to 94.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; Common stock repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.0 million as compared to 68.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; Redemption of Series A preferred units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.0 million as compared to 8.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and Dividends on common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 18.7 million as compared to 9.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Funds from Operations FFO and Adjusted Funds from Operations AFFO We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit. Nareit defines FFO as net income (loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, real estate related depreciation, depletion and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), impairment write-downs of depreciated property, and adjustments associated with impairment write-downs for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management presents FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of improvements on our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the Nareit definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. We do not, however, believe that FFO is the only measure of our operating performance. Changes in GAAP accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of Nareit s definition of FFO in 1999 result in the inclusion of a number of items in FFO that do not correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. Therefore, in addition to FFO, we present AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the Company s operational performance than FFO. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. Even AFFO, however, 

 46 

Table of Contents 
 does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts, especially in connection with full-year rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms. Management considers AFFO per share, fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to GAAP earnings per share. AFFO per share, fully diluted provides additional insight into how our operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted, and, accordingly, our AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted may not always be comparable to AFFO and AFFO per share amounts calculated by other REITs. AFFO and AFFO per share, fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or earnings per share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance or as a measure of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. AFFO is calculated by adjusting FFO to exclude or include the income and expenses that we believe are not reflective of the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance, as further explained below: Real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs. Acquisition (including audit fees associated with these acquisitions) and due diligence costs are incurred for investment purposes and, therefore, do not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. The Company incurred an immaterial amount of acquisition and due diligence costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO provides useful supplemental information reflective of the realized economic impact of our current acquisition strategy, which is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance. These exclusions also improve the comparability of our results over each reporting period and of the Company with other real estate operators. Stock-based compensation and incentive. Stock-based compensation and incentive is a non-cash expense and, therefore, does not correlate with the ongoing operations of our portfolio. We believe that excluding these costs from AFFO improves the comparability of our results over each reporting period and of the Company with other real estate operators. Deferred impact of interest rate swap terminations. When an interest rate swap is terminated and the related termination fees are rolled into a new swap, the terminated swap's termination fees are amortized over what would have been the remaining life of the terminated swap, while the related contractual and financial obligations extend over the life of the new swap. We believe that, with this adjustment, AFFO better reflects the actual cash cost of the fixed interest rate we are obligated to pay under the new swap agreement, and results in improved comparability of our results across reporting periods. Distributions on Series A preferred units . Dividends on Series A preferred units, which are convertible into Common units on or after February 10, 2026, have a fixed and certain impact on our cash flow, and therefore are excluded from AFFO. We believe this improves the comparability of the Company with other real estate operators. Common shares fully diluted. In accordance with GAAP, common shares used to calculate earnings per share are presented on a weighted average basis. Common shares on a fully diluted basis includes shares of common stock, Common units, and unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding at the end of the period on a share equivalent basis, because all shares are participating securities and thus share in the performance of the Company. The conversion of Series A preferred units is excluded from the calculation of common shares fully diluted as they are not participating securities, and therefore do not share in the performance of the Company and their impact on shares outstanding is uncertain. Severance expense . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a one-time severance expense of approximately 1.4 million in connection with the previously announced departure of the Company s former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer as part of the Company s cost-cutting initiative. The Company incurred no severance expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or the three and nine

Nareit defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

 EBITDAre is a key financial measure used to evaluate the Company s operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, cash flows from operating activities or net income, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that EBITDAre is a useful performance measure commonly reported and will be widely used by analysts and investors in the Company s industry. However, while EBITDAre is a performance measure widely used across the Company s industry, the Company does not believe that it correctly captures the Company s business operating performance because it includes non-cash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand the Company s business operating performance. Therefore, in addition to EBITDAre, management uses Adjusted EBITDAre, a non-GAAP measure. We further adjust EBITDAre for certain additional items such as stock-based compensation and incentive, indirect offering costs, real estate acquisition related audit fees and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs and severance expense (for a full discussion of these adjustments, see AFFO adjustments discussed above) that we consider necessary to understand our operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAre provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and EBITDAre, is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our operating performance. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre do not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements; and Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results of operations and using EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre only as a supplemental measure of our performance. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net income to our EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for the periods indicated below (unaudited):

 Seasonality We recognize rental revenue from fixed-rate farmland leases on a pro rata basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). Notwithstanding GAAP accounting requirements to spread rental revenue over the lease term, a significant portion of fixed rent is received in a lump sum before planting season, in the first quarter, and after harvest, in the fourth quarter. We receive a significant portion of our variable rental payments in the fourth calendar quarter of each year, following harvest, with only a portion of such payments being recognized ratably through the year in accordance with GAAP, in relation to crop insurance contracts entered into by our tenants. The highly seasonal nature of the agriculture industry causes seasonality in our business to some extent. Our financial performance should be evaluated on an annual basis, which eliminates impacts of seasonality and other similar factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary during the course of the year. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market-sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business strategies, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our primary interest rate exposure will be SOFR. We may use fixed interest rate financing to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. On a limited basis, we also use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. We do not use such derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes. At September 30, 2024, 111.4 million, or 28.3 , of our debt had variable interest rates. However, as stated in Note 10 Hedge Accounting to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has an interest rate swap with Rabobank for 33.2 million, which reduces floating rate exposure to 78.2 million. After adjusting the 33.2 million of swapped Rabobank debt as fixed rate debt, the ratio of floating rate debt to total debt decreased from 28.3 to 19.8 . Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we have repaid most of our floating rate debt with the proceeds of the Farmland Reserve Transaction. After these repayments, 11.8 million, or 5.7 , of our debt had variable interest rates. However, the Company amended its existing swap agreement to adjust the total notional amount of the Company s receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate swap from 33.2 million to 11.8 million, effectively reducing our floating rate exposure to 0. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosures and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of the end of the period covered by this report.

 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. For information regarding legal proceedings as of September 30, 2024, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in response to Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None. Share Repurchase Program On March 15, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to 25.0 million in shares of our common stock. Repurchases under this program may be made from time to time, in amounts and prices as we deem appropriate. Repurchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, trading restrictions under our insider trading policy and other relevant factors. This share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified or suspended at any time at our discretion. We expect to fund repurchases under the program using cash on our balance sheet. On August 1, 2018, our Board of Directors increased the authority under the share repurchase to 38.5 million. On November 7, 2019, the Board of Directors approved an additional 50 million under the share repurchase program. On May 3, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 75.0 million increase. On November 1, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 40.0 million increase in the total authorization
