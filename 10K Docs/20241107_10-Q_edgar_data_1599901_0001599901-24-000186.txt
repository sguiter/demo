 million and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of billion. 
 The Company believes that existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund the Company s operations for at least 12 months from the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. The Company plans to finance its future cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other arrangements. If the Company is not able to secure adequate additional funding, it may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, and/or delay or reduce the scope of its planned development programs. Any of these actions could materially harm the Company s business, results of operations and future prospects. 
 In December 2023, the Company formed Avidity Biosciences Ireland Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary (the Subsidiary). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of Avidity Biosciences, Inc. and the Subsidiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 The unrealized losses on the Company s marketable securities were caused by interest rate increases and resulted in the decrease in market value of these securities. There were allowances for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 because (i) the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, (ii) the Company does not intend to sell the investments before maturity, and (iii) it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases.

 In April 2024, the Company entered into a sublease agreement with Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. to rent square feet for office and laboratory space for the Company s future corporate headquarters. The term of the sublease is approximately 9 years and 9 months with payments expected to begin in August 2025. Pursuant to the terms of the sublease agreement, the sublandlord will provide the Company with a tenant improvement allowance of up to million. An additional tenant improvement allowance of up to million is also available to be repaid in equal installments through monthly rent payments, subject to interest per annum and annual increases of per annum.

 square feet in an adjacent available building, which has not been exercised. Total aggregate future lease commitments under the sublease agreement are approximately million, inclusive of annual rent increases and various agreed upon rent abatement amounts. The sublease will be measured and recognized upon commencement of the sublease. As of September 30, 2024, the sublease had not commenced because construction of improvements to bring the facility to its intended use was not substantially complete. 
 In connection with the sublease agreement, the Company is required to maintain a letter of credit for the benefit of the sublandlord in the amount of million, which was delivered in April 2024 and is included in restricted cash in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet.

 million through the 2022 Sales Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock were made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the 2022 Sales Agent. The Company was not obligated to sell, and the 2022 Sales Agent was not obligated to buy or sell, any shares of common stock under the 2022 Sales Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold and shares of its common stock, respectively, pursuant to the 2022 Sales Agreement and received net proceeds of million and million, respectively, after deducting offering-related transaction costs and commissions. 
 On March 4, 2024, the Company sold unregistered shares of its common stock and pre-funded warrants in lieu of common stock to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of its common stock to investors in a private placement at an offering price of per share and per pre-funded warrant, which represents the offering price per share of common stock less an exercise price of per share. The Company valued the common stock at the offering price, concluding that the offering price approximated fair value. The net proceeds from the private placement were million after deducting placement fees and offering costs of million. The resale of the shares, including the shares issuable upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants, were subsequently registered on an automatically effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on April 2, 2024. 
 The pre-funded warrants are a freestanding instrument that do not meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480 and do not meet the definition of a derivative pursuant to ASC 815. The Company valued the pre-funded warrants at the offering price, concluding that the offering price approximated fair value. The pre-funded warrants meet the equity classification criteria and were accounted for as a component of additional paid-in capital. The pre-funded warrants are immediately exercisable and do not expire. 
 One of the investors who participated in the private placement met the criteria of a related party as such investor was a principal owner of more than 10 of the voting interest in the Company (the Principal Owner). The Principal Owner purchased shares of the Company's common stock for million. The purchase of common stock under the private placement by the Principal Owner was carried out at arm's length as substantiated by the fact that the per share purchase price equaled the price paid by other participants. No amounts were due from the Principal Owner as of September 30, 2024. 
 On June 17, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million. The shares sold in the offering were registered pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which became automatically effective upon filing on May 9, 2024. 
 On August 9, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement (the 2024 Sales Agreement) with TD Securities (USA) LLC (the 2024 Sales Agent) with substantially similar terms as the 2022 Sales Agreement. The 2022 Sales Agreement was terminated upon effectiveness of the 2024 Sales Agreement. Under the 2024 Sales Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million through the 2024 Sales Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the 2024 Sales Agent. The

 Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units 
 The Company has granted restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs) to employees of the Company under the 2020 Incentive Award and the 2022 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plans. RSUs and PSUs are valued at the market price of a share of the Company s stock on the date of grant. RSUs vest ratably on an annual basis over a service period and are payable in shares of common stock on the vesting date. Compensation expense for RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized over the service period when the performance conditions are met or considered probable of achievement, using management's best estimates. Forfeitures are recorded in the period in which they occur.

 Granted Vested ) Forfeited Unvested at September 30, 2024 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the performance conditions related to units of outstanding PSUs were met or deemed probable resulting in (1) the immediate vesting of units and (2) the expected vesting of units in December 2024 and another units in March 2025.

The total fair value of PSU shares vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million. PSUs vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The Company had an outstanding liability of million at September 30, 2024, which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, for employee contributions to the ESPP for shares pending issuance at the end of the current offering period. As of September 30, 2024, shares of common stock were available for issuance under the ESPP.

Risk-Free Interest Rate. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate assumption for equity awards on the rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. 
 Expected Volatility. The expected volatility of stock options is estimated based on the average historical volatilities of common stock of comparable publicly traded companies and the Company's own volatility. The comparable companies are chosen based on their size and stage in the life cycle. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available. 
 Expected Term. The Company's limited option exercise history does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating expected term, therefore the Company has estimated the expected life of its stock options using the simplified method, whereby the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The expected life assumption for employee stock purchases under the ESPP is to conform with the ESPP offering period.

Delpacibart braxlosiran, or del-brax (formerly AOC 1020), is the first investigational therapy designed to directly target DUX4 in people living with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, and is currently in Phase 1/2 development with the FORTITUDE TM trial. Delpacibart zotadirsen, or del-zota (formerly AOC 1044), is designed for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, and is currently in Phase 1/2 development with the EXPLORE44 trial. Del-zota is specifically designed for people with mutations amenable to exon 44 skipping, or DMD44, and is the first of multiple AOCs we are developing for DMD. Del-desiran, del-brax and del-zota have all been granted Orphan Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and Fast Track Designation by the FDA. In addition, the FDA has granted del-desiran Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of DM1 and granted del-zota Rare Pediatric Disease designation. We have reported data from each of our three AOC product candidates in 2024. 
 Phase 3 HARBOR TM for DM1 (del-desiran) 
 We are developing del-desiran to treat people living with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Del-desiran is being studied in the Phase 3 global HARBOR trial in adults living with DM1 and is also being studied in the ongoing MARINA-OLE trial with all of the participants who completed the Phase 1/2 MARINA trial. Long-term data from the MARINA-OLE trial showed reversal of disease progression in people living with DM1 across

 multiple endpoints including video hand opening time (vHOT) as a measure of hand function and myotonia, muscle strength and activities of daily living when compared to END-DM1 natural history data. 
 In June 2024, we initiated and began administration of del-desiran in people living with DM1 in our ongoing global Phase 3 HARBOR trial and enrollment remains on track. In October 2024, the FDA removed the partial clinical hold placed on del-desiran in September 2022. 
 Phase 1/2 EXPLORE44 TM for DMD44 (del-zota) 
 We are developing del-zota to treat people living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to exon 44 skipping (DMD44). Del-zota is designed to deliver phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) to skeletal muscle and heart tissue to specifically skip exon 44 of dystrophin mRNA to enable dystrophin production. Del-zota is currently in Phase 1/2 development as part of the EXPLORE44 trial in people with DMD44. Del-zota is the first of multiple AOCs we are developing for DMD. 
 In August 2024, we reported initial data from the 5 mg/kg cohort of our EXPLORE44 trial in people living with DMD44. These data demonstrated consistent delivery of PMO in skeletal muscle, an increase in the mean dystrophin production of 25 of normal and a mean increase of 37 in exon 44 skipping. In addition, del-zota showed greater than 80 reduction of creatine kinase compared to baseline in people living with DMD44. 
 The initial assessment from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled EXPLORE44 trial assessed the safety and tolerability for 25 participants across two dose levels (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg). Del-zota demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability, with most treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) mild or moderate in participants with DMD44. Two participants discontinued from the study: one due to a serious adverse event of anaphylaxis which fully resolved and one due to moderate infusion related reaction. For the 5 mg/kg cohort, participants received three doses of 5 mg/kg of del-zota, or placebo, every six weeks. 
 Enrollment is now complete for the EXPLORE44 study. Participants in the EXPLORE44 trial have the option to enroll in the EXPLORE44 Open-Label Extension (OLE) for del-zota. In addition, we have begun enrolling an additional 10-15 participants directly into the EXPLORE44-OLE. We also announced plans to advance additional exon-skipping candidates from our DMD franchise. Exon 45 is currently in IND-enabling studies for the treatment of people living with DMD mutations amendable to exon 45 skipping (DMD45). Additional targeted exons have not been disclosed. 
 Phase 1/2 FORTITUDE TM for FSHD (del-brax) 
 We are developing del-brax to treat the underlying cause of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), which is the abnormal expression of the DUX4 gene. Del-brax aims to reduce the expression of DUX4 mRNA and DUX4 protein in muscles in people with FSHD. Del-brax is currently in Phase 1/2 development as part of the FORTITUDE trial in adults living with FSHD. In July, the first participants from FORTITUDE TM began to roll over to the FORTITUDE Open-Label Extension (OLE) trial. All participants that complete FORTITUDE TM are eligible to enroll in the FORTITUDE-OLE TM trial. 
 In October 2024, we announced the initiation of the biomarker cohort in the Phase 1/2 FORTITUDE TM trial of del-brax. The biomarker cohort in the FORTITUDE trial will assess the impact of del-brax 2 mg/kg every six weeks in people living with FSHD, ages 16-70. The primary endpoints of the study are changes in DUX4 regulated gene expression and DUX4 regulated circulating biomarker. We are pursuing a potential accelerated approval path for del-brax and expect enrollment in the biomarker cohort to be completed in the first half of 2025. We remain on track to initiate the functional cohort for del-brax in the first of half of 2025. 
 In June 2024, we shared initial del-brax data from our Phase 1/2 FORTITUDE trial from our 2mg/kg cohort which demonstrated consistent reductions of greater than 50 in double homeobox 4, or DUX4 regulated genes, trends of functional improvement, and favorable safety and tolerability in people living with FSHD. The initial assessment from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled FORTITUDE trial of del-brax provided a four-month look at the safety and tolerability for all 39 participants across two dose levels (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg). 
 Company Advancements 
 We continue to advance and expand our internal discovery pipeline with the addition of new research and development candidates to treat conditions in skeletal muscle and precision cardiology. In November 2024, we plan to provide a first look at precision cardiology candidates and share a glimpse into our next-generation technology innovations.

 We are well positioned as we build an integrated global biopharmaceutical company and continue to deliver on the RNA revolution. In addition to our own internal research programs, we continue to explore the full potential of our AOC platform through collaborations and partnerships, including programs in immunology, cardiology and other select indications outside of muscle. 
 Since our inception in 2012, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our proprietary AOC platform, identifying potential product candidates, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research, preclinical and clinical studies, and providing other general and administrative support for these operations. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We are currently building our global commercial infrastructure in North America and Europe to support our anticipated launches of products currently in clinical development. In June 2020, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, and have since raised capital through additional public offerings, private placements, sales agreements, and under collaboration and research license agreements. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information on the capital raised since inception and our future capital requirements. 
 We have incurred operating losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were 212.2 million and 174.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 220.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 790.8 million. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially as we conduct our ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials, continue our research and development activities, utilize third parties to manufacture our product candidates and related raw materials, hire additional personnel and protect our intellectual property. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities, as well as the generation of any collaboration and services revenue. 
 Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately 1.6 billion (as of September 30, 2024) will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. While we may generate revenue under our current and/or future collaboration agreements, we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and may never occur. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed, on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Research Collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb 
 In November 2023, we entered into (i) a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the BMS Collaboration Agreement, with Bristol Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, to expand on our research with MyoKardia for up to five targets utilizing our proprietary AOC platform technology and (ii) a Securities Purchase Agreement with BMS, or the BMS Purchase Agreement, for the purchase by BMS in a private placement of 5,075,304 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 7.8813 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 40 million. We refer to the BMS Collaboration Agreement and the BMS Purchase Agreement together as the "BMS Agreements." Under the terms of the BMS Agreements, we received approximately 100 million upfront, which includes a 60 million cash payment under the terms of the BMS Collaboration Agreement, and approximately 40 million for the purchase of our common stock under the terms of the BMS Purchase Agreement. We are also eligible to receive up to approximately 1.35 billion in research and development milestone payments, up to approximately 825 million in commercial milestone payments, and tiered royalties from high single digits to low double-digits on net sales. We are responsible for our own research collaboration costs incurred under the agreement, subject to a cumulative spending limit of 40 million. BMS will fund all future clinical development, regulatory and commercialization activities coming from this collaboration.

 Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company 
 In April 2019, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Lilly Agreement, with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, for the discovery, development and commercialization of AOC products in immunology and other select indications on a worldwide basis. Under the Lilly Agreement, we and Lilly will collaborate on preclinical research and discovery activities for such products, with Lilly being responsible for funding the cost of such activities by both parties. Lilly will also lead the clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of all such products, at its sole cost. We granted Lilly an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, under our technology to research, develop, manufacture, and sell products containing AOCs that are directed to up to six mRNA targets. We retain the right to use our technology to perform our obligations under the agreement and for all purposes not granted to Lilly. Lilly paid us an upfront license fee of 20.0 million in 2019, and we are eligible to receive up to 60.0 million in development milestone payments per target, up to 140.0 million in regulatory milestone payments per target and up to 205.0 million in commercialization milestone payments per target. We are eligible to receive a tiered royalty ranging from the mid-single to low-double digits from Lilly on worldwide annual net sales of licensed products, subject to specified and capped reductions for the market entry of biosimilar products, loss of patent coverage of licensed products and for payments owed to third parties for additional rights necessary to commercialize licensed products in the territory. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our revenue to date has been derived from payments received under research collaboration and license agreements. For the foreseeable future, we may generate revenue from a combination of upfront payments, milestone payments and reimbursement of services under our current and/or future collaboration agreements. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products unless and until such time that our product candidates have advanced through clinical development and regulatory approval, if ever. We expect that any revenue we generate, if at all, will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments relating to such services and milestones and the extent to which any of our products are approved and successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete preclinical and clinical development of product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenues and our results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist of external and internal costs associated with our research and development activities, including our discovery and research efforts, and the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Our research and development expenses include: 
 external costs, including expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants and our scientific advisors; and 
 internal costs, including; 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; 
 the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study materials; and 
 facilities, information technology and depreciation, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment. 
 Research and development costs, including costs reimbursed under the Lilly Agreement, are expensed as incurred, with reimbursements of such amounts being recognized as revenue. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received. 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 At any one time, we are working on multiple programs. Our internal resources, employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any one research or drug discovery program and are typically deployed across multiple programs. 
 We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct our ongoing research and development activities, advance our preclinical research programs toward clinical development, including conducting IND-enabling studies, and conduct clinical trials. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates. 
 The timelines and costs associated with research and development activities are uncertain, can vary significantly for each product candidate and development program, and are difficult to predict. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to preclinical and clinical results, regulatory developments, ongoing assessments as to each program s commercial potential, and our ability to maintain or enter into new collaborations, to the extent we determine the resources or expertise of a collaborator would be beneficial for a given program. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which development programs may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 Our development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as: 
 the number and scope of clinical, preclinical and IND-enabling studies; 
 per patient trial costs; 
 the number of trials required for approval; 
 the number of sites included in the trials; 
 the countries in which the trials are conducted; 
 the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; 
 the number of patients that participate in the trials; 
 the number of doses that patients receive; 
 the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; 
 potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 
 the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; 
 the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates; 
 the phase of development of our product candidates; and 
 the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees in our executive, finance, accounting, legal, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include allocated facility, information technology and depreciation related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, and professional fees for auditing, tax, intellectual property, and legal services. Costs related to filing and pursuing patent applications are recognized as general and administrative expenses as incurred since recoverability of such expenditures is uncertain. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and development activities and other corporate activities. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, due to increased external costs associated with the progression of clinical trials and preclinical studies, including 29.0 million in higher manufacturing cost related to monoclonal antibodies used across programs, as well as higher internal costs including 13.6 million in higher personnel costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to 6.4 million in higher personnel costs and 2.0 million in higher professional fees to support our expanded operations. Similarly, general and administrative expenses increased by 19.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to 13.9 million in higher personnel costs and 2.7 million in higher professional fees to support our expanded operations. 
 Other Income 
 Other income increased by 11.5 million and 20.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, due to higher interest income earned on marketable securities investments and cash and cash equivalent balances. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 On November 8, 2022, we entered into a sales agreement, or the 2022 Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or the 2022 Sales Agent, which has since been terminated, as discussed below. Under the 2022 Sales Agreement, we could, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 200.0 million through the 2022 Sales Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, would be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the 2022 Sales Agent. We were not obligated to sell, and the 2022 Sales Agent was not obligated to buy or sell, any shares of common stock under the 2022 Sales Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold 418,408 and 4,107,810 shares of our common stock, respectively, pursuant to the 2022 Sales Agreement and received net proceeds of 5.6 million and 60.5 million, respectively, after deducting offering-related transaction costs and commissions. 
 On March 4, 2024, we completed a private placement of 15,224,773 shares of our common stock at a price of 16.50 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate 9,030,851 shares of our common stock at a price of 16.499 per pre-funded warrant. The net proceeds from the private placement were 379.8 million after deducting placement fees and offering costs of 20.4 million. Each pre-funded warrant has an exercise price of 0.001 per share of common stock, is immediately exercisable, and does not expire. 
 On June 17, 2024, we completed a public offering of 12,132,500 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of 38.00 per share. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately 432.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of 28.3 million. The shares sold in the offering were registered pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which became automatically effective upon filing on May 9, 2024. 
 On August 9, 2024, we entered into a sales agreement (the 2024 Sales Agreement) with TD Securities (USA) LLC (the 2024 Sales Agent) with substantially similar terms as the 2022 Sales Agreement. The 2022 Sales Agreement was terminated upon effectiveness of the 2024 Sales Agreement. Under the 2024 Sales Agreement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 400.0 million through the 2024 Sales Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the 2024 Sales Agent. We are not obligated to sell, and the 2024 Sales Agent is not obligated to buy or sell, any shares of common stock under the 2024 Sales Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had not sold any shares of our common stock under the 2024 Sales Agreement. 
 On August 16, 2024, we completed a public offering of 8,418,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 41.00 per share. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately 323.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of 21.4 million. The shares sold in the offering were 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 registered pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which became automatically effective upon filing on May 9, 2024. 
 Since our inception through September 30, 2024, other significant sources of capital raised to fund our operations were comprised of 274.1 million from our IPO, 378.9 million from follow-on public offerings, 140.6 million of net proceeds under a previous sales agreement (2021 Sales Agreement), aggregate gross proceeds of 131.6 million from the sale and issuance of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes, and 144.6 million from funding under collaboration and research services agreements, including approximately 40.0 million related to the sale of shares of common stock in November 2023 to BMS in a private placement under the BMS Purchase Agreement. 
 Future Capital Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 1.6 billion. Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of conducting preclinical studies and testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these studies and trials is uncertain. 
 Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: 
 the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs, and timing of discovery, preclinical studies, and clinical trials of our product candidates that we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future; 
 the costs and timing of manufacturing for our product candidates and preparation for possible commercial operations if any product candidate is approved; 
 the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 
 the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other arrangements; 
 the costs of obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights; 
 the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities, and preparation for future commercial activities, if any, increase; 
 the timing and amount of the milestone or other payments made to us under our existing and any future collaboration agreements; 
 the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if any product candidate is approved; 
 our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; and 
 costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire. 
 While we may generate revenue under our current and/or future collaboration agreements, we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and may never occur. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including current and potential future collaborations, licenses and other arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed, on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition

 and could force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (200,999) (135,565) (65,434) Investing activities (790,029) (181,110) (608,919) Financing activities 1,178,633 61,973 1,116,660 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 187,605 (254,702) 442,307 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 201.0 million and 135.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisted primarily of cash used to fund our operations related to the development of clinical trials, preclinical studies, and other programs. The increase is due to increased research and development costs as well as general and administrative expenses as described under Results of Operations above. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 790.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 1.1 billion for purchases of marketable securities and reinvestment of proceeds from matured marketable securities as well as 3.2 million in purchases of property and equipment, offset by 349.7 million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities of 181.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 407.2 million for purchases of marketable securities due to investing the proceeds from the sale of common stock of 223.8 million in December 2022 and reinvestment of proceeds from matured marketable securities, and 3.4 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by 229.5 million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 In April 2024, we entered into a sublease agreement to rent office and laboratory space for our future corporate headquarters. Total aggregate future lease commitments under the sublease agreement are approximately 72.6 million. Refer to Note 7, "Commitments and Contingencies" to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for further details. Except for the sublease agreement, as of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business to the contractual obligations we reported in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations and Commitments, included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our market risk from that described in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 As disclosed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024, we previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to segregation of duties over certain information technology general controls (ITGCs) related to a module within our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. These ITGCs were not operating effectively to (i) restrict access to certain data and the ability to make changes thereto, and (ii) to monitor changes to such data. While the control deficiency identified did not result in any misstatements, a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements and disclosures would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, our management believes the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Remediation 
 Our management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. As discussed above and disclosed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024, we have changed the relevant access to address the known segregation of duties issues and will update our access review controls to include additional procedures. While we believe the actions taken thus far are substantive in addressing this control issue, we will consider this remediated once applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We will continue to monitor through testing the effectiveness of these actions to ensure these controls continue to operate effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The risk factors described in such reports are not the only risks we face.

You will continue to serve as the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer. 2. Duties. You will be responsible for the general operations and management of the Company and other duties or areas of responsibility that may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ), to whom you will report. You shall devote your best efforts and full business time, skill and attention to the performance of your duties. You will also be expected to adhere to the general employment policies and practices of the Company that may be in effect from time to time, except that when the terms of this Agreement conflict with the Company s general employment policies or practices, this Agreement will control. 3. Salary. You will be paid an annual base salary of 659,900, less applicable deductions and withholdings, to be paid each month in accordance with the Company s payroll practices, as may be in effect from time to time. 4. Benefits. You will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company s standard benefit programs, subject to the terms and conditions of such plans. The Company may, from time to time, change these benefits in its discretion. Additional information regarding these benefits is available for your review upon request. 5. Equity Awards. You will remain eligible to receive Stock Awards (as defined below) covering the Company s common stock under the equity plans maintained by the Company. 6. Performance Bonuses. You will be eligible to earn an annual incentive bonus equal to fifty-five percent (55 of your annual base salary (your Target Bonus ). Whether you receive such a bonus, and the amount of any such bonus, shall be determined by the Board (or duly authorized committee thereof) in its sole discretion, and shall be based upon achievement of performance objectives established by the Board (or duly authorized committee thereof) and other criteria to be determined by the Board (or duly authorized committee thereof). Any bonus shall be paid within thirty (30) days after the Board s (or such committee s) determination that a bonus 

Page 2 2 US-DOCS\150944263.7 shall be awarded. Except as described in Section 7 below, you must be employed on the day that your bonus (if any) is paid in order to earn the bonus. Therefore, if your employment is terminated either by you or the Company for any reason prior to the bonus being paid, you will not have earned the bonus and no partial or prorated bonus will be paid. 7. At-Will Employment; Termination. (a) At-Will Employment. Your employment with Company will be at-will. This means that either you or Company may terminate your employment at any time, with or without Cause or Good Reason (each as defined below), and with or without advance notice. In the event of your termination of employment for any reason, the Company shall pay to you (i) your fully earned but unpaid base salary, when due, through the date of your termination of employment at the rate then in effect, (ii) accrued and unused vacation and/or paid time off, (iii) if your termination occurs after the occurrence of a Change of Control and after the conclusion of a calendar year in respect of which no annual bonus has yet been paid (i.e., such termination occurs on or after January 1, but before the designated payment date for the annual bonus in respect of such completed calendar year), your annual bonus for such completed calendar year based on actual performance as determined by the Board (or duly authorized committee thereof), paid when annual bonuses are paid to the Company s employees generally for such completed calendar year, but in all events prior to March 15 of the calendar year in which your termination occurs, plus (iv) all other benefits, if any, under any Company group retirement plan, nonqualified deferred compensation plan, equity award plan or agreement, health benefits plan or other Company group benefit plan to which you may be entitled pursuant to the terms of such plans or agreements at the time of your termination of employment (the Accrued Obligations ). (b) Termination For Cause; Resignation Without Good Reason. If, at any time, the Company terminates your employment for Cause, you resign without Good Reason, or if either party terminates your employment as a result of your death or disability, you will receive the Accrued Obligations. Under these circumstances, you will not be entitled to any other form of compensation from the Company, including any severance benefits. (c) Termination Without Cause; Resignation With Good Reason Not in Connection With a Change of Control. If at any time other than during the Change of Control Period (as defined below), the Company terminates your employment without Cause or you resign for Good Reason, and other than any termination of your employment as a result of your death or disability, and provided such termination constitutes a separation from service (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), without regard to any alternative definition thereunder, a Separation from Service ), then subject to your obligations below, you shall be entitled to receive the following severance benefits (collectively, the Severance Benefits ): (i) an amount equal to eighteen (18) months of your then current base salary (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your base salary which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the base salary in effect prior to such material diminution), to be paid over such 

Page 3 3 US-DOCS\150944263.7 eighteen (18) month period, on the schedule described in clause (e) below (the Salary Continuation 1 and (ii) if you timely elect continued coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended COBRA for yourself and your covered dependents under the Company s group health plans following such termination or resignation of employment, then the Company shall pay the COBRA premiums necessary to continue your health insurance coverage in effect for yourself and your eligible dependents on the termination date until the earliest of (A) the close of the eighteen (18) month period following the termination of your employment, (B) the expiration of your eligibility for the continuation coverage under COBRA, or (C) the date when you become eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment or self-employment (such period from the termination date through the earliest of (A) through (C), the COBRA Payment Period ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the payment of the COBRA premiums could result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of providing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to instead pay you on the first day of each month of the COBRA Payment Period, a fully taxable cash payment equal to the COBRA premiums for that month, subject to applicable tax withholdings (such amount, the Special Severance Payment ), for the remainder of the COBRA Payment Period. You may, but are not obligated to, use such Special Severance Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums. On the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service, the Company will make the first payment under this clause (and, in the case of the Special Severance Payment, such payment will be paid to you in a lump sum) equal to the aggregate amount of payments that the Company would have paid through such date had such payments commenced on the Separation from Service through such sixtieth (60th) day, with the balance of the payments paid thereafter on the schedule described above. If you become eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, you must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause shall cease. (d) Termination Without Cause; Resignation With Good Reason During the Change of Control Period. If the Company terminates your employment without Cause or you resign for Good Reason, and other than any termination of your employment as a result of your death or disability, in each case within fifty-nine (59) days prior to or twenty-four (24) months following the effective date of a Change of Control (as defined herein) (the Change of Control Period ), and provided such termination constitutes a Separation from Service, then subject to your obligations below, you shall be entitled to receive the following severance benefits (collectively, the Change of Control Severance Benefits in lieu of the Severance Benefits (and for the avoidance of doubt, in no event will you be entitled to both the Severance Benefits and the Change of Control Severance Benefits): 1 Note to Draft: Other C-Suite executives to provide for lump sum payout. 

Page 4 4 US-DOCS\150944263.7 (i) an amount equal to twenty-four (24) months of your then current base salary (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your base salary which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the base salary in effect prior to such material diminution), less all applicable withholdings and deductions, to be paid as follows: (A) an amount equal to eighteen (18) months of your then current base salary (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your base salary which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the base salary in effect prior to such material diminution) shall be paid in substantially equal installments over eighteen (18) months following your termination, on the schedule described in clause (e) below (the Change of Control Salary Continuation ), and (B) an amount equal to six (6) months of your then current base salary (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your base salary which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the base salary in effect prior to such material diminution) shall be paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service; (ii) an amount equal to 200 of your Target Bonus for the calendar year in which your termination occurs (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your Target Bonus which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the Target Bonus in effect prior to such material diminution), less all applicable withholdings and deductions, paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service; (iii) an amount equal to your Target Bonus for the calendar year in which your termination occurs (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your Target Bonus which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the Target Bonus in effect prior to such material diminution), prorated for the portion of the year that has elapsed through your date of termination of employment with the Company, less all applicable withholdings and deductions, paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service; (iv) if you timely elect continued coverage under COBRA for yourself and your covered dependents under the Company s group health plans following such termination or resignation of employment, then the Company shall pay the COBRA premiums necessary to continue your health insurance coverage in effect for yourself and your eligible dependents on the termination date until the earliest of (A) the close of the eighteen (18) month period following the termination of your employment, (B) the expiration of your eligibility for the continuation coverage under COBRA, or (C) the date when you become eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment or self-employment (such period from the termination date through the earliest of (A) through (C), the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the payment of the COBRA premiums could result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of providing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to instead pay you on the first day of each month of the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period, the Special Severance 

Page 5 5 US-DOCS\150944263.7 Payment, for the remainder of the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period. You may, but are not obligated to, use such Special Severance Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums. On the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service, the Company will make the first payment under this clause (and, in the case of the Special Severance Payment, such payment will be paid to you in a lump sum) equal to the aggregate amount of payments that the Company would have paid through such date had such payments commenced on the Separation from Service through such sixtieth (60th) day, with the balance of the payments paid thereafter on the schedule described above. If you become eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, you must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause shall cease; (v) an amount equal to (A) the monthly COBRA premiums necessary to continue your health insurance coverage in effect for yourself and your eligible dependents on the termination date (calculated based on the premium as of the date of termination), multiplied by (B) six (6), paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service; and (vi) acceleration of 100 of any unvested time-based Stock Awards. Such acceleration shall be effective as of the later of (A) the effective date of your Separation from Service, or (B) the date of such Change of Control (for the avoidance of doubt, the accelerated vesting of any Stock Awards that are performance-based shall be governed by the applicable equity plan and agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award pursuant to which they were granted). The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each Stock Award and to supersede any less favorable provision in any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if any Stock Award is subject to more favorable vesting pursuant to any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award, such more favorable provisions shall continue to apply and shall not be limited by this clause (vii)). (e) Conditions For Receipt of Severance Benefits or Change of Control Severance Benefits. The Severance Benefits or Change of Control Severance Benefits are conditional upon (x) your continuing to comply with your obligations under your Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement; (y) your delivering to the Company an effective, general release of claims in favor of the Company in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Release ), and any revocation period thereunder having expired, within sixty (60) days following your termination date; and (z) if you are a member of the Board, your resignation from the Board, to be effective no later than the date of your termination date (or such other date as requested by the Board). The Salary Continuation or Change of Control Salary Continuation will be paid in equal installments on the Company s regular payroll schedule and will be subject to applicable tax withholdings over the period outlined above following the date of your Separation from Service; provided, however, that no payments will be made prior to the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service. On the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service, the Company will pay you in a lump sum the Salary Continuation or Change of Control Salary Continuation, as applicable, that you would have received on or prior to such date under the original schedule but for the delay while waiting for the sixtieth (60th) day in compliance with Code Section 409A and the effectiveness of the Release, with the balance of 

Page 6 6 US-DOCS\150944263.7 the Salary Continuation or Change of Control Salary Continuation, as applicable, being paid as originally scheduled. (f) No Mitigation. You shall not be required in any way to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7, including, without limitation, by seeking other employment, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7 be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of employment with another employer after the termination date of employment, or otherwise. (g) Definitions. (i) Definition of Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean one or more of the following: (A) your willful failure substantially to perform your duties and responsibilities to the Company or deliberate violation of a Company policy; (B) your commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other willful misconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in material injury to the Company; (C) your unauthorized use or disclosure of any proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company or any other party to whom you owe an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of your relationship with the Company; or (D) your willful breach of any of your obligations under any written agreement or covenant with the Company. The determination as to whether you are being terminated for Cause shall be made in good faith by the Board. The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the Company s ability to terminate your employment at any time. (ii) Definition of Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall mean your resignation from employment with the Company if any of the following actions are taken by the Company without your prior written consent: (A) a material reduction in your base salary or Target Bonus if such a reduction is not made in proportion to an across-the-board reduction for all senior executives of the Company (and for the avoidance of doubt, following a Change of Control, the reference to senior executives of the Company shall include, without limitation, the senior executives of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor)); (B) a material reduction or material adverse change in your duties, responsibilities and/or authorities, including, without limitation, following a Change of Control, your ceasing to report to the board of directors of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor), and/or your ceasing to serve as the chief executive officer of such ultimate parent entity; (C) relocation of your principal place of employment to a place that increases your one-way commute by more than fifty (50) miles as compared to your then- current principal place of employment immediately prior to such relocation; or (D) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement or any agreement under which you provide services. Provided, however that, such termination by you shall only be deemed for Good Reason pursuant to the foregoing definition if (i) the Company is given written notice from you within ninety (90) 

Page 7 7 US-DOCS\150944263.7 days following the first occurrence of the condition that you consider to constitute Good Reason describing the condition and the Company fails to satisfactorily remedy such condition within thirty (30) days following such written notice, and (ii) you terminate employment within ninety (90) days following the end of the period within which the Company was entitled to remedy the condition constituting Good Reason but failed to do so. (iii) Definition of Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, Change of Control shall have the meaning given to such term in the Company s 2020 Incentive Award Plan as in effect on the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation, the transaction or event constituting the Change of Control must also constitute a change in control event (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. (iv) Definition of Stock Awards. For purposes of this Agreement, Stock Awards shall mean all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted pursuant to the Company s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof. 8. Section 409A. It is intended that all of the severance benefits and other payments payable under this Agreement satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A- 1(b)(5) and 1.409A-1(b)(9), and this Agreement will be construed to the greatest extent possible as consistent with those provisions, and to the extent not so exempt, this Agreement (and any definitions hereunder) will be construed in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A. For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), your right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if you are deemed by the Company at the time of your Separation from Service to be a specified employee for purposes of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), and if any of the payments upon Separation from Service set forth herein and/or under any other agreement with the Company are deemed to be deferred compensation , then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments shall not be provided to you prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of your Separation from Service with the Company, (ii) the date of your death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation. Upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum to you, and any remaining payments due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein or in the applicable agreement. No interest shall be due on any amounts so deferred. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under the Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A to the extent that such reimbursements or in-kind benefits are subject to Section 409A, including, where applicable, the 

Page 8 8 US-DOCS\150944263.7 requirements that (A) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during your lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (B) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (C) the reimbursement of any eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (D) the right to reimbursement is not subject to set off or liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent any payments to you pursuant to this Agreement constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code or are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), then, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code or to satisfy such exception, no amount shall be payable pursuant to such sections unless your termination of employment constitutes a Separation from Service. 9. Parachute Payments. (a) Best Pay Provision. In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the Total Payments would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the Excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the Parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that 

Page 9 9 US-DOCS\150944263.7 results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. (b) Determinations. All determinations regarding the application of this Section 9 shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the 280G Firm ). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this Section 9 shall be done by the 280G Firm in consultation with the Company. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be parachute payments. You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. 10. Confidentiality Obligations. (a) Confidentiality Obligations. In connection with your employment, you have signed and agreed to abide by the Company s standard form of Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B (the Confidentiality Agreement ). In your work for the Company, you are expected not to use or disclose any confidential information, including trade secrets, of any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. Rather, you are expected to use only that information which is generally known and used by persons with training and experience comparable to your own, which is common knowledge in the industry or otherwise legally in the public domain, or which is otherwise provided or developed by the Company. You agree that you will not bring onto Company premises any unpublished documents or property belonging to any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. You hereby represent that your employment does not create a conflict with any agreement between you and a third party. 

Page 10 10 US-DOCS\150944263.7 (b) Other Protections. You acknowledge that the Company has provided you with the following notice of immunity rights in compliance with the requirements of the Defend Trade Secrets Act: (i) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; (ii) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and (iii) if you file a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, you may disclose the confidential information to your attorney and use the confidential information in the court proceeding, if you file any document containing the confidential information under seal, and do not disclose the confidential information, except pursuant to court order. In addition, nothing in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent you from (x) communicating directly with, cooperating with, or providing information to, or receiving financial awards from, any federal, state or local government agency, including without limitation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, without notifying or seeking permission from the Company, (y) exercising any rights you may have under Section 7 of the U.S. National Labor Relations Act, such as the right to engage in concerted activity, including collective action or discussion concerning wages or working conditions, or (z) discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination based on a protected characteristic or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful. 11. Arbitration. To ensure the timely and economical resolution of disputes that may arise in connection with your employment with the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Company agree that any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action arising from or relating to the enforcement, breach, performance, negotiation, execution, or interpretation of this Agreement, your employment, or the termination of your employment, including but not limited to statutory claims, shall be resolved pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1- 16, or if inapplicable, the California Arbitration Act, and to the fullest extent permitted by law by final, binding and confidential arbitration, by a single neutral arbitrator in San Diego, California, chosen jointly by the parties, and will be conducted by JAMS, Inc. JAMS under the then applicable JAMS rules (which can be found at the following web address: https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/ or will be provided to you upon request without charge). If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator in accordance with JAMS rules. By agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both you and the Company waive the right to resolve any such dispute through a trial by jury or judge or administrative proceeding. The Company acknowledges that you will have the right to be represented by legal counsel at any arbitration proceeding. In addition, all claims, disputes, or causes of action under this paragraph, whether by you or the Company, must be brought in an individual capacity, and shall not be brought as a plaintiff (or claimant) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, nor joined or consolidated with the claims of any other person or entity. The arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person or entity, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. To the extent that the preceding sentences regarding class claims or proceedings are found to violate applicable law or are otherwise found unenforceable, any claim(s) alleged or brought on behalf of a class shall 

Page 11 11 US-DOCS\150944263.7 proceed in a court of law rather than by arbitration. This paragraph shall not apply to an action or claim brought in court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, as amended. The arbitrator shall: (a) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (b) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any or all remedies that you or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law. The Company shall pay all JAMS arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required of you if the dispute were filed in Superior Court. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either you or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. Any awards or orders in such arbitrations may be entered and enforced as judgments in the federal and state courts of any competent jurisdiction. 12. Successors. This Agreement is intended to bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by you and the Company, and our respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators, except that you may not assign any of your duties or rights hereunder without the express written consent of the Company. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the Company s business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform any of the Company s obligations under this Agreement. 13. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto, is the complete and exclusive statement of all of the terms and conditions of your employment with the Company, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior agreements or representations with regard to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral, including, without limitation, the Prior Agreement. It is entered into without reliance on any promise or representation other than those expressly contained herein, and it cannot be modified, amended or extended except in a writing signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein. This Agreement and the terms of your employment with the Company shall be governed in all aspects by the laws of the State of California. 14. Indemnification. You will receive defense and be indemnified by the Company to the full extent of the provisions of the Company s charter and bylaws and applicable California and Delaware law and the Indemnification Agreement between you and the Company attached hereto as Exhibit C. 15. Withholding and other Deductions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the payment of the COBRA premiums could result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as 

5 US-DOCS\152925120.1 amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of providing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to instead pay you on the first day of each month of the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period, the Special Severance Payment, for the remainder of the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period. You may, but are not obligated to, use such Special Severance Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums. On the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service, the Company will make the first payment under this clause (and, in the case of the Special Severance Payment, such payment will be paid to you in a lump sum) equal to the aggregate amount of payments that the Company would have paid through such date had such payments commenced on the Separation from Service through such sixtieth (60th) day, with the balance of the payments paid thereafter on the schedule described above. If you become eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, you must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause shall cease; and (v) (x) acceleration of 100 of any unvested time-based Stock Awards. Such acceleration shall be effective as of the later of (A) the effective date of your Separation from Service, or (B) the date of such Change of Control (for the avoidance of doubt, the accelerated vesting of any Stock Awards that are performance-based shall be governed by the applicable equity plan and agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award pursuant to which they were granted), and (y) your vested Stock Awards will remain exercisable by you until the latest of (A) six (6) months after the date of your termination of employment, or (B) such longer period as may be specified in the applicable Stock Award agreement; provided that in no event shall any Stock Award remain exercisable beyond the original outside expiration date of such Stock Award. The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each Stock Award and to supersede any less favorable provision in any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if any Stock Award is subject to more favorable vesting pursuant to any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award, such more favorable provisions shall continue to apply and shall not be limited by this clause (v)).

The Severance Benefits or Change of Control Severance Benefits are conditional upon (x) your continuing to comply with your obligations under your Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement; (y) your delivering to the Company an effective, general release of claims in favor of the Company in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Release ), and any revocation period thereunder having expired, within sixty (60) days following your termination date; and (z) if you are a member of the Board, your resignation from the Board, to be effective no later than the date of your termination date (or such other date as requested by the Board). (f) No Mitigation. You shall not be required in any way to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7, including, without limitation, by seeking other employment, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7 be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of employment with another employer after the termination date of employment, or otherwise.

For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean one or more of the following: (A) your willful failure substantially to perform your duties and responsibilities to the Company causing material harm to the Company after written notice to you specifying such failure and your failure to cure within sixty (60) days or deliberate violation of a written Company policy causing material harm to the Company; (B) your commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other willful misconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in material injury to the Company; (C) your unauthorized use or disclosure of any proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company or any other party to whom you owe an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of your relationship with the Company; or (D) your willful breach of any of your obligations under any written agreement or covenant with the Company. The determination as to whether you are being terminated for Cause shall be made in good faith by the Board. The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the Company s ability to terminate your employment at any time. (ii) Definition of Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall mean your resignation from employment with the Company if any of the following actions are taken by the Company without your prior written consent: (A) a material reduction in your base salary or Target Bonus if such a reduction is not made in proportion to an across-the-board reduction for all senior executives of the Company (and for the avoidance of doubt, following a Change of Control, the reference to senior executives of the Company shall include, without limitation, the senior executives of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor)); (B) a material reduction or material adverse change in your duties, responsibilities and/or authorities or a requirement that you report to someone other than the Company s Chief Executive Officer, including, without limitation, following a Change of Control, your ceasing to report to the chief executive officer of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor), and/or your ceasing to serve as the Chief Financial and Business Officer of such ultimate parent entity; provided that, prior to a Change of Control, it shall not constitute Good Reason if such reduction is a mere change of title alone; (C) relocation of your principal place of employment to a place that increases your one-way commute by more than fifty (50) miles as compared to your then- current principal place of employment immediately prior to such relocation; or (D) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement or any agreement under which you provide services. Provided, however that, such termination by you shall only be deemed for Good Reason pursuant to the foregoing definition if (i) the Company is given written notice from you within ninety (90) days following the first occurrence of the condition that you consider to constitute Good Reason describing the condition and the Company fails to satisfactorily remedy such condition within thirty (30) days following such written notice, and (ii) you terminate employment within ninety 

7 US-DOCS\152925120.1 (90) days following the end of the period within which the Company was entitled to remedy the condition constituting Good Reason but failed to do so. (iii) Definition of Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, Change of Control shall have the meaning given to such term in the Company s 2020 Incentive Award Plan as in effect on the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation, the transaction or event constituting the Change of Control must also constitute a change in control event (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. (iv) Definition of Stock Awards. For purposes of this Agreement, Stock Awards shall mean all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted pursuant to the Company s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof. 8. Section 409A. It is intended that all of the severance benefits and other payments payable under this Agreement satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A- 1(b)(5) and 1.409A-1(b)(9), and this Agreement will be construed to the greatest extent possible as consistent with those provisions, and to the extent not so exempt, this Agreement (and any definitions hereunder) will be construed in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A. For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), your right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if you are deemed by the Company at the time of your Separation from Service to be a specified employee for purposes of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), and if any of the payments upon Separation from Service set forth herein and/or under any other agreement with the Company are deemed to be deferred compensation , then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments shall not be provided to you prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of your Separation from Service with the Company, (ii) the date of your death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation. Upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum to you, and any remaining payments due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein or in the applicable agreement. No interest shall be due on any amounts so deferred. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under the Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A to the extent that such reimbursements or in- kind benefits are subject to Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirements that (A) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during your lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (B) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a 

8 US-DOCS\152925120.1 calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (C) the reimbursement of any eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (D) the right to reimbursement is not subject to set off or liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent any payments to you pursuant to this Agreement constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code or are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), then, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code or to satisfy such exception, no amount shall be payable pursuant to such sections unless your termination of employment constitutes a Separation from Service. 9. Parachute Payments. (a) Best Pay Provision. In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the Total Payments would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the Excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the Parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. 

9 US-DOCS\152925120.1 (b) Determinations. All determinations regarding the application of this Section 9 shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the 280G Firm ). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this Section 9 shall be done by the 280G Firm in consultation with the Company. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be parachute payments. You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. 10. Confidentiality Obligations. (a) Confidentiality Obligations. In connection with your employment, you have signed and agreed to abide by the Company s standard form of Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B (the Confidentiality Agreement ). In your work for the Company, you are expected not to use or disclose any confidential information, including trade secrets, of any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. Rather, you are expected to use only that information which is generally known and used by persons with training and experience comparable to your own, which is common knowledge in the industry or otherwise legally in the public domain, or which is otherwise provided or developed by the Company. You agree that you will not bring onto Company premises any unpublished documents or property belonging to any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. You hereby represent that your employment does not create a conflict with any agreement between you and a third party. (b) Other Protections. You acknowledge that the Company has provided you with the following notice of immunity rights in compliance with the requirements of the Defend 

10 US-DOCS\152925120.1 Trade Secrets Act: (i) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; (ii) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and (iii) if you file a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, you may disclose the confidential information to your attorney and use the confidential information in the court proceeding, if you file any document containing the confidential information under seal, and do not disclose the confidential information, except pursuant to court order. In addition, nothing in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent you from (x) communicating directly with, cooperating with, or providing information to, or receiving financial awards from, any federal, state or local government agency, including without limitation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, without notifying or seeking permission from the Company, (y) exercising any rights you may have under Section 7 of the U.S. National Labor Relations Act, such as the right to engage in concerted activity, including collective action or discussion concerning wages or working conditions, or (z) discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination based on a protected characteristic or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful. 11. Arbitration. To ensure the timely and economical resolution of disputes that may arise in connection with your employment with the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Company agree that any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action arising from or relating to the enforcement, breach, performance, negotiation, execution, or interpretation of this Agreement, your employment, or the termination of your employment, including but not limited to statutory claims, shall be resolved pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1-16, and to the fullest extent permitted by law by final, binding and confidential arbitration, by a single neutral arbitrator in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, chosen jointly by the parties, and will be conducted by JAMS, Inc. JAMS under the then applicable JAMS rules (which can be found at the following web address: https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/ or will be provided to you upon request without charge). If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator in accordance with JAMS rules. By agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both you and the Company waive the right to resolve any such dispute through a trial by jury or judge or administrative proceeding. The Company acknowledges that you will have the right to be represented by legal counsel at any arbitration proceeding. In addition, all claims, disputes, or causes of action under this paragraph, whether by you or the Company, must be brought in an individual capacity, and shall not be brought as a plaintiff (or claimant) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, nor joined or consolidated with the claims of any other person or entity. The arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person or entity, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. To the extent that the preceding sentences regarding class claims or proceedings are found to violate applicable law or are otherwise found unenforceable, any claim(s) alleged or brought on behalf of a class shall proceed in a court of law rather than by arbitration. This paragraph shall not apply to an action or claim brought in court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 

11 US-DOCS\152925120.1 2004, as amended. The arbitrator shall: (a) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (b) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any or all remedies that you or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law. The Company shall pay all JAMS arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required of you if the dispute were filed in Superior Court. The Company shall pay your reasonable attorneys fees and costs should you prevail in the arbitration. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either you or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. Any awards or orders in such arbitrations may be entered and enforced as judgments in the federal and state courts of any competent jurisdiction. 12. Successors. This Agreement is intended to bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by you and the Company, and our respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators, except that you may not assign any of your duties or rights hereunder without the express written consent of the Company. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the Company s business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform any of the Company s obligations under this Agreement. 13. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto, is the complete and exclusive statement of all of the terms and conditions of your employment with the Company, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior agreements or representations with regard to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral, including, without limitation, the Prior Agreement. It is entered into without reliance on any promise or representation other than those expressly contained herein, and it cannot be modified, amended or extended except in a writing signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein.

On the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service, the Company will make the first payment under this clause (and, in the case of the Special Severance Payment, such payment will be paid to you in a lump sum) equal to the aggregate amount of payments that the Company would 

5 US-DOCS\152924018.1 have paid through such date had such payments commenced on the Separation from Service through such sixtieth (60th) day, with the balance of the payments paid thereafter on the schedule described above. If you become eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, you must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause shall cease; and (v) acceleration of 100 of any unvested time-based Stock Awards. Such acceleration shall be effective as of the later of (A) the effective date of your Separation from Service, or (B) the date of such Change of Control (for the avoidance of doubt, the accelerated vesting of any Stock Awards that are performance-based shall be governed by the applicable equity plan and agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award pursuant to which they were granted). The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each Stock Award and to supersede any less favorable provision in any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if any Stock Award is subject to more favorable vesting pursuant to any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award, such more favorable provisions shall continue to apply and shall not be limited by this clause (v)). (e) Conditions For Receipt of Severance Benefits or Change of Control Severance Benefits. The Severance Benefits or Change of Control Severance Benefits are conditional upon (x) your continuing to comply with your obligations under your Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement; (y) your delivering to the Company an effective, general release of claims in favor of the Company in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Release ), and any revocation period thereunder having expired, within sixty (60) days following your termination date; and (z) if you are a member of the Board, your resignation from the Board, to be effective no later than the date of your termination date (or such other date as requested by the Board). (f) No Mitigation. You shall not be required in any way to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7, including, without limitation, by seeking other employment, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7 be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of employment with another employer after the termination date of employment, or otherwise. (g) Definitions. (i) Definition of Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean one or more of the following: (A) your willful failure substantially to perform your duties and responsibilities to the Company or deliberate violation of a Company policy (B) your commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other willful misconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in material injury to the Company; (C) your unauthorized use or disclosure of any proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company or any other party to whom you owe an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of your relationship with the Company; or (D) your willful breach of any of your obligations under any written agreement or covenant with the Company. The determination as to whether you are being 

6 US-DOCS\152924018.1 terminated for Cause shall be made in good faith by the Board. The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the Company s ability to terminate your employment at any time. (ii) Definition of Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall mean your resignation from employment with the Company if any of the following actions are taken by the Company without your prior written consent: (A) a material reduction in your base salary or Target Bonus if such a reduction is not made in proportion to an across-the-board reduction for all senior executives of the Company (and for the avoidance of doubt, following a Change of Control, the reference to senior executives of the Company shall include, without limitation, the senior executives of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor)); (B) a material reduction or material adverse change in your duties, responsibilities and/or authorities including, without limitation, following a Change of Control, your ceasing to report to the chief executive officer of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor), and/or your ceasing to serve as the Chief Scientific and Technical Officer of such ultimate parent entity; provided that, prior to a Change of Control, it shall not constitute Good Reason if such reduction is a mere change of title alone or change in reporting relationship; (C) relocation of your principal place of employment to a place that increases your one-way commute by more than fifty (50) miles as compared to your then- current principal place of employment immediately prior to such relocation; or (D) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement or any agreement under which you provide services. Provided, however that, such termination by you shall only be deemed for Good Reason pursuant to the foregoing definition if (i) the Company is given written notice from you within ninety (90) days following the first occurrence of the condition that you consider to constitute Good Reason describing the condition and the Company fails to satisfactorily remedy such condition within thirty (30) days following such written notice, and (ii) you terminate employment within ninety (90) days following the end of the period within which the Company was entitled to remedy the condition constituting Good Reason but failed to do so. (iii) Definition of Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, Change of Control shall have the meaning given to such term in the Company s 2020 Incentive Award Plan as in effect on the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation, the transaction or event constituting the Change of Control must also constitute a change in control event (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. 

7 US-DOCS\152924018.1 (iv) Definition of Stock Awards. For purposes of this Agreement, Stock Awards shall mean all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted pursuant to the Company s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof. 8. Section 409A. It is intended that all of the severance benefits and other payments payable under this Agreement satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A- 1(b)(5) and 1.409A-1(b)(9), and this Agreement will be construed to the greatest extent possible as consistent with those provisions, and to the extent not so exempt, this Agreement (and any definitions hereunder) will be construed in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A. For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), your right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if you are deemed by the Company at the time of your Separation from Service to be a specified employee for purposes of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), and if any of the payments upon Separation from Service set forth herein and/or under any other agreement with the Company are deemed to be deferred compensation , then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments shall not be provided to you prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of your Separation from Service with the Company, (ii) the date of your death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation. Upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum to you, and any remaining payments due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein or in the applicable agreement. No interest shall be due on any amounts so deferred. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under the Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A to the extent that such reimbursements or in- kind benefits are subject to Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirements that (A) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during your lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (B) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (C) the reimbursement of any eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (D) the right to reimbursement is not subject to set off or liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent any payments to you pursuant to this Agreement constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code or are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), then, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code or to satisfy such exception, no amount shall be payable pursuant to such sections unless your termination of employment constitutes a Separation from Service. 

8 US-DOCS\152924018.1 9. Parachute Payments. (a) Best Pay Provision. In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the Total Payments would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the Excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the Parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. (b) Determinations. All determinations regarding the application of this Section 9 shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the 280G Firm ). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason 

9 US-DOCS\152924018.1 of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this Section 9 shall be done by the 280G Firm in consultation with the Company. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be parachute payments. You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. 10. Confidentiality Obligations. (a) Confidentiality Obligations. In connection with your employment, you have signed and agreed to abide by the Company s standard form of Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B (the Confidentiality Agreement ). In your work for the Company, you are expected not to use or disclose any confidential information, including trade secrets, of any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. Rather, you are expected to use only that information which is generally known and used by persons with training and experience comparable to your own, which is common knowledge in the industry or otherwise legally in the public domain, or which is otherwise provided or developed by the Company. You agree that you will not bring onto Company premises any unpublished documents or property belonging to any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. You hereby represent that your employment does not create a conflict with any agreement between you and a third party. (b) Other Protections. You acknowledge that the Company has provided you with the following notice of immunity rights in compliance with the requirements of the Defend Trade Secrets Act: (i) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; (ii) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and (iii) if you file a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, you may disclose the confidential information to your attorney and use the 

10 US-DOCS\152924018.1 confidential information in the court proceeding, if you file any document containing the confidential information under seal, and do not disclose the confidential information, except pursuant to court order. In addition, nothing in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent you from (x) communicating directly with, cooperating with, or providing information to, or receiving financial awards from, any federal, state or local government agency, including without limitation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, without notifying or seeking permission from the Company, (y) exercising any rights you may have under Section 7 of the U.S. National Labor Relations Act, such as the right to engage in concerted activity, including collective action or discussion concerning wages or working conditions, or (z) discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination based on a protected characteristic or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful. 11. Arbitration. To ensure the timely and economical resolution of disputes that may arise in connection with your employment with the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Company agree that any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action arising from or relating to the enforcement, breach, performance, negotiation, execution, or interpretation of this Agreement, your employment, or the termination of your employment, including but not limited to statutory claims, shall be resolved pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1-16, or if inapplicable, the California Arbitration Act, and to the fullest extent permitted by law by final, binding and confidential arbitration, by a single neutral arbitrator in San Diego County, California, chosen jointly by the parties, and will be conducted by JAMS, Inc. JAMS under the then applicable JAMS rules (which can be found at the following web address: https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/ or will be provided to you upon request without charge). If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator in accordance with JAMS rules. By agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both you and the Company waive the right to resolve any such dispute through a trial by jury or judge or administrative proceeding. The Company acknowledges that you will have the right to be represented by legal counsel at any arbitration proceeding. In addition, all claims, disputes, or causes of action under this paragraph, whether by you or the Company, must be brought in an individual capacity, and shall not be brought as a plaintiff (or claimant) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, nor joined or consolidated with the claims of any other person or entity. The arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person or entity, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. To the extent that the preceding sentences regarding class claims or proceedings are found to violate applicable law or are otherwise found unenforceable, any claim(s) alleged or brought on behalf of a class shall proceed in a court of law rather than by arbitration. This paragraph shall not apply to an action or claim brought in court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, as amended. The arbitrator shall: (a) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (b) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any or all remedies that you or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law. The Company shall pay all JAMS arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required of you if the dispute were filed in Superior Court. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either you or the 

11 US-DOCS\152924018.1 Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. Any awards or orders in such arbitrations may be entered and enforced as judgments in the federal and state courts of any competent jurisdiction. 12. Successors. This Agreement is intended to bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by you and the Company, and our respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators, except that you may not assign any of your duties or rights hereunder without the express written consent of the Company. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the Company s business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform any of the Company s obligations under this Agreement. 13. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto, is the complete and exclusive statement of all of the terms and conditions of your employment with the Company, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior agreements or representations with regard to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral, including, without limitation, the Prior Agreement. It is entered into without reliance on any promise or representation other than those expressly contained herein, and it cannot be modified, amended or extended except in a writing signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein. This Agreement and the terms of your employment with the Company shall be governed in all aspects by the laws of the State of California. 14. Indemnification. You will receive defense and be indemnified by the Company to the full extent of the provisions of the Company s charter and bylaws and applicable California and Delaware law and the Indemnification Agreement between you and the Company attached hereto as Exhibit C. 15. Withholding and other Deductions. All compensation payable to you hereunder shall be subject to such deductions as the Company is from time to time required to make pursuant to law, governmental regulation or order. 16. Notices.

You will remain eligible to receive Stock Awards (as defined below) covering the Company s common stock under the equity plans maintained by the Company. 

2 US-DOCS\152924232.1 6. Performance Bonuses. You will be eligible to earn an annual incentive bonus equal to forty percent (40 of your annual base salary (your Target Bonus ). Whether you receive such a bonus, and the amount of any such bonus, shall be determined by the Company s Board of Directors (the Board (or duly authorized committee thereof) in its sole discretion, and shall be based upon achievement of performance objectives established by the Board (or duly authorized committee thereof) and other criteria to be determined by the Board (or duly authorized committee thereof). Any bonus shall be paid within thirty (30) days after the Board s (or such committee s) determination that a bonus shall be awarded. Except as described in Section 7 below, you must be employed on the day that your bonus (if any) is paid in order to earn the bonus. Therefore, if your employment is terminated either by you or the Company for any reason prior to the bonus being paid, you will not have earned the bonus and no partial or prorated bonus will be paid. 7. At-Will Employment; Termination. (a) At-Will Employment. Your employment with Company will be at-will. This means that either you or Company may terminate your employment at any time, with or without Cause or Good Reason (each as defined below), and with or without advance notice. In the event of your termination of employment for any reason, the Company shall pay to you (i) your fully earned but unpaid base salary, when due, through the date of your termination of employment at the rate then in effect, (ii) accrued and unused vacation and/or paid time off, (iii) if your termination occurs after the occurrence of a Change of Control and after the conclusion of a calendar year in respect of which no annual bonus has yet been paid (i.e., such termination occurs on or after January 1, but before the designated payment date for the annual bonus in respect of such completed calendar year), your annual bonus for such completed calendar year based on actual performance as determined by the Board (or duly authorized committee thereof), paid when annual bonuses are paid to the Company s employees generally for such completed calendar year, but in all events prior to March 15 of the calendar year in which your termination occurs, plus (iv) all other benefits, if any, under any Company group retirement plan, nonqualified deferred compensation plan, equity award plan or agreement, health benefits plan or other Company group benefit plan to which you may be entitled pursuant to the terms of such plans or agreements at the time of your termination of employment (the Accrued Obligations ). (b) Termination For Cause; Resignation Without Good Reason. If, at any time, the Company terminates your employment for Cause, you resign without Good Reason, or if either party terminates your employment as a result of your death or disability, you will receive the Accrued Obligations. Under these circumstances, you will not be entitled to any other form of compensation from the Company, including any severance benefits. (c) Termination Without Cause; Resignation With Good Reason Not in Connection With a Change of Control. If at any time other than during the Change of Control Period (as defined below), the Company terminates your employment without Cause or you resign for Good Reason, and other than any termination of your employment as a result of your death or disability, and provided such termination constitutes a separation from service (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), without regard to any alternative definition thereunder, a Separation from Service ), then subject to your obligations below, you shall be entitled to receive the following severance benefits (collectively, the Severance Benefits ): 

3 US-DOCS\152924232.1 (i) an amount equal to twelve (12) months of your then current base salary (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your base salary which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the base salary in effect prior to such material diminution), to be paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service (the Salary Severance and (ii) if you timely elect continued coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended COBRA for yourself and your covered dependents under the Company s group health plans following such termination or resignation of employment, then the Company shall pay the COBRA premiums necessary to continue your health insurance coverage in effect for yourself and your eligible dependents on the termination date until the earliest of (A) the close of the twelve (12) month period following the termination of your employment, (B) the expiration of your eligibility for the continuation coverage under COBRA, or (C) the date when you become eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment or self-employment (such period from the termination date through the earliest of (A) through (C), the COBRA Payment Period ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the payment of the COBRA premiums could result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of providing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to instead pay you on the first day of each month of the COBRA Payment Period, a fully taxable cash payment equal to the COBRA premiums for that month, subject to applicable tax withholdings (such amount, the Special Severance Payment ), for the remainder of the COBRA Payment Period. You may, but are not obligated to, use such Special Severance Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums. On the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service, the Company will make the first payment under this clause (and, in the case of the Special Severance Payment, such payment will be paid to you in a lump sum) equal to the aggregate amount of payments that the Company would have paid through such date had such payments commenced on the Separation from Service through such sixtieth (60th) day, with the balance of the payments paid thereafter on the schedule described above. If you become eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, you must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause shall cease. (d) Termination Without Cause; Resignation With Good Reason During the Change of Control Period. If the Company terminates your employment without Cause or you resign for Good Reason, and other than any termination of your employment as a result of your death or disability, in each case within fifty-nine (59) days prior to or twenty-four (24) months following the effective date of a Change of Control (as defined herein) (the Change of Control Period ), and provided such termination constitutes a Separation from Service, then subject to your obligations below, you shall be entitled to receive the following severance benefits (collectively, the Change of Control Severance Benefits in lieu of the Severance Benefits (and 

4 US-DOCS\152924232.1 for the avoidance of doubt, in no event will you be entitled to both the Severance Benefits and the Change of Control Severance Benefits): (i) an amount equal to eighteen (18) months of your then current base salary (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your base salary which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the base salary in effect prior to such material diminution), less all applicable withholdings and deductions, to be paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service (the Change of Control Salary Severance (ii) an amount equal to 150 of your Target Bonus for the calendar year in which your termination occurs (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your Target Bonus which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the Target Bonus in effect prior to such material diminution), less all applicable withholdings and deductions, paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service; (iii) an amount equal to your Target Bonus for the calendar year in which your termination occurs (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your Target Bonus which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the Target Bonus in effect prior to such material diminution), prorated for the portion of the year that has elapsed through your date of termination of employment with the Company, less all applicable withholdings and deductions, paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service; (iv) if you timely elect continued coverage under COBRA for yourself and your covered dependents under the Company s group health plans following such termination or resignation of employment, then the Company shall pay the COBRA premiums necessary to continue your health insurance coverage in effect for yourself and your eligible dependents on the termination date until the earliest of (A) the close of the eighteen (18) month period following the termination of your employment, (B) the expiration of your eligibility for the continuation coverage under COBRA, or (C) the date when you become eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment or self-employment (such period from the termination date through the earliest of (A) through (C), the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the payment of the COBRA premiums could result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of providing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to instead pay you on the first day of each month of the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period, the Special Severance Payment, for the remainder of the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period. You may, but are not obligated to, use such Special Severance Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums. On the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service, the Company will make the first payment under this clause (and, in the case of the Special Severance Payment, such payment will be paid to you in a lump sum) equal to the aggregate amount of payments that the Company would 

5 US-DOCS\152924232.1 have paid through such date had such payments commenced on the Separation from Service through such sixtieth (60th) day, with the balance of the payments paid thereafter on the schedule described above. If you become eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, you must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause shall cease; and (v) acceleration of 100 of any unvested time-based Stock Awards. Such acceleration shall be effective as of the later of (A) the effective date of your Separation from Service, or (B) the date of such Change of Control (for the avoidance of doubt, the accelerated vesting of any Stock Awards that are performance-based shall be governed by the applicable equity plan and agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award pursuant to which they were granted). The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each Stock Award and to supersede any less favorable provision in any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if any Stock Award is subject to more favorable vesting pursuant to any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award, such more favorable provisions shall continue to apply and shall not be limited by this clause (v)). (e) Conditions For Receipt of Severance Benefits or Change of Control Severance Benefits. The Severance Benefits or Change of Control Severance Benefits are conditional upon (x) your continuing to comply with your obligations under your Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement; (y) your delivering to the Company an effective, general release of claims in favor of the Company in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Release ), and any revocation period thereunder having expired, within sixty (60) days following your termination date; and (z) if you are a member of the Board, your resignation from the Board, to be effective no later than the date of your termination date (or such other date as requested by the Board). (f) No Mitigation. You shall not be required in any way to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7, including, without limitation, by seeking other employment, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7 be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of employment with another employer after the termination date of employment, or otherwise. (g) Definitions. (i) Definition of Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean one or more of the following: (A) your willful failure substantially to perform your duties and responsibilities to the Company or deliberate violation of a Company policy; (B) your commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other willful misconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in material injury to the Company; (C) your unauthorized use or disclosure of any proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company or any other party to whom you owe an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of your relationship with the Company; or (D) your willful breach of any of your obligations under any written agreement or covenant with the Company. The determination as to whether you are being 

6 US-DOCS\152924232.1 terminated for Cause shall be made in good faith by the Board. The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the Company s ability to terminate your employment at any time. (ii) Definition of Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall mean your resignation from employment with the Company if any of the following actions are taken by the Company without your prior written consent: (A) a material reduction in your base salary or Target Bonus if such a reduction is not made in proportion to an across-the-board reduction for all senior executives of the Company (and for the avoidance of doubt, following a Change of Control, the reference to senior executives of the Company shall include, without limitation, the senior executives of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor)); (B) a material reduction or material adverse change in your duties, responsibilities and/or authorities including, without limitation, following a Change of Control, your ceasing to report to the chief executive officer of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor), and/or your ceasing to serve as the Chief Human Resources Officer of such ultimate parent entity; provided that, prior to a Change of Control, it shall not constitute Good Reason if such reduction is a mere change of title alone or change in reporting relationship; (C) relocation of your principal place of employment to a place that increases your one-way commute by more than fifty (50) miles as compared to your then- current principal place of employment immediately prior to such relocation; or (D) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement or any agreement under which you provide services. Provided, however that, such termination by you shall only be deemed for Good Reason pursuant to the foregoing definition if (i) the Company is given written notice from you within ninety (90) days following the first occurrence of the condition that you consider to constitute Good Reason describing the condition and the Company fails to satisfactorily remedy such condition within thirty (30) days following such written notice, and (ii) you terminate employment within ninety (90) days following the end of the period within which the Company was entitled to remedy the condition constituting Good Reason but failed to do so. (iii) Definition of Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, Change of Control shall have the meaning given to such term in the Company s 2020 Incentive Award Plan as in effect on the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation, the transaction or event constituting the Change of Control must also constitute a change in control event (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. (iv) Definition of Stock Awards. For purposes of this Agreement, Stock Awards shall mean all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted 

7 US-DOCS\152924232.1 pursuant to the Company s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof. 8. Section 409A. It is intended that all of the severance benefits and other payments payable under this Agreement satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A- 1(b)(5) and 1.409A-1(b)(9), and this Agreement will be construed to the greatest extent possible as consistent with those provisions, and to the extent not so exempt, this Agreement (and any definitions hereunder) will be construed in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A. For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), your right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if you are deemed by the Company at the time of your Separation from Service to be a specified employee for purposes of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), and if any of the payments upon Separation from Service set forth herein and/or under any other agreement with the Company are deemed to be deferred compensation , then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments shall not be provided to you prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of your Separation from Service with the Company, (ii) the date of your death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation. Upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum to you, and any remaining payments due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein or in the applicable agreement. No interest shall be due on any amounts so deferred. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under the Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A to the extent that such reimbursements or in- kind benefits are subject to Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirements that (A) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during your lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (B) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (C) the reimbursement of any eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (D) the right to reimbursement is not subject to set off or liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent any payments to you pursuant to this Agreement constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code or are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), then, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code or to satisfy such exception, no amount shall be payable pursuant to such sections unless your termination of employment constitutes a Separation from Service. 

8 US-DOCS\152924232.1 9. Parachute Payments. (a) Best Pay Provision. In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the Total Payments would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the Excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the Parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. (b) Determinations. All determinations regarding the application of this Section 9 shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the 280G Firm ). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 

9 US-DOCS\152924232.1 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this Section 9 shall be done by the 280G Firm in consultation with the Company. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be parachute payments. You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. 10. Confidentiality Obligations. (a) Confidentiality Obligations. In connection with your employment, you have signed and agreed to abide by the Company s standard form of Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B (the Confidentiality Agreement ). In your work for the Company, you are expected not to use or disclose any confidential information, including trade secrets, of any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. Rather, you are expected to use only that information which is generally known and used by persons with training and experience comparable to your own, which is common knowledge in the industry or otherwise legally in the public domain, or which is otherwise provided or developed by the Company. You agree that you will not bring onto Company premises any unpublished documents or property belonging to any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. You hereby represent that your employment does not create a conflict with any agreement between you and a third party. (b) Other Protections. You acknowledge that the Company has provided you with the following notice of immunity rights in compliance with the requirements of the Defend Trade Secrets Act: (i) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; (ii) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and (iii) if you file a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, you may disclose the confidential information to your attorney and use the confidential information in the court proceeding, if you file any document containing the confidential information under seal, and do not disclose the confidential information, except 

10 US-DOCS\152924232.1 pursuant to court order. In addition, nothing in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent you from (x) communicating directly with, cooperating with, or providing information to, or receiving financial awards from, any federal, state or local government agency, including without limitation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, without notifying or seeking permission from the Company, (y) exercising any rights you may have under Section 7 of the U.S. National Labor Relations Act, such as the right to engage in concerted activity, including collective action or discussion concerning wages or working conditions, or (z) discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination based on a protected characteristic or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful. 11. Arbitration. To ensure the timely and economical resolution of disputes that may arise in connection with your employment with the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Company agree that any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action arising from or relating to the enforcement, breach, performance, negotiation, execution, or interpretation of this Agreement, your employment, or the termination of your employment, including but not limited to statutory claims, shall be resolved pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1-16, and to the fullest extent permitted by law by final, binding and confidential arbitration, by a single neutral arbitrator in Missoula County, Montana, chosen jointly by the parties, and will be conducted by JAMS, Inc. JAMS under the then applicable JAMS rules (which can be found at the following web address: https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/ or will be provided to you upon request without charge). If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator in accordance with JAMS rules. By agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both you and the Company waive the right to resolve any such dispute through a trial by jury or judge or administrative proceeding. The Company acknowledges that you will have the right to be represented by legal counsel at any arbitration proceeding. In addition, all claims, disputes, or causes of action under this paragraph, whether by you or the Company, must be brought in an individual capacity, and shall not be brought as a plaintiff (or claimant) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, nor joined or consolidated with the claims of any other person or entity. The arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person or entity, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. To the extent that the preceding sentences regarding class claims or proceedings are found to violate applicable law or are otherwise found unenforceable, any claim(s) alleged or brought on behalf of a class shall proceed in a court of law rather than by arbitration. This paragraph shall not apply to an action or claim brought in court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, as amended. The arbitrator shall: (a) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (b) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any or all remedies that you or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law. The Company shall pay all JAMS arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required of you if the dispute were filed in Superior Court. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either you or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. Any awards or orders in such arbitrations may be entered and enforced as judgments in the federal and state courts of any competent jurisdiction. 

11 US-DOCS\152924232.1 12. Successors. This Agreement is intended to bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by you and the Company, and our respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators, except that you may not assign any of your duties or rights hereunder without the express written consent of the Company. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the Company s business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform any of the Company s obligations under this Agreement. 13. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto, is the complete and exclusive statement of all of the terms and conditions of your employment with the Company, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior agreements or representations with regard to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral, including, without limitation, the Prior Agreement. It is entered into without reliance on any promise or representation other than those expressly contained herein, and it cannot be modified, amended or extended except in a writing signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein. This Agreement and the terms of your employment with the Company shall be governed in all aspects by the laws of the State of Montana. 14. Indemnification. You will receive defense and be indemnified by the Company to the full extent of the provisions of the Company s charter and bylaws and applicable Montana and Delaware law and the Indemnification Agreement between you and the Company attached hereto as Exhibit C. 15. Withholding and other Deductions.

3 US-DOCS\152924433.1 a Separation from Service ), then subject to your obligations below, you shall be entitled to receive the following severance benefits (collectively, the Severance Benefits ): (i) an amount equal to twelve (12) months of your then current base salary (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your base salary which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the base salary in effect prior to such material diminution), to be paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service (the Salary Severance and (ii) if you timely elect continued coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended COBRA for yourself and your covered dependents under the Company s group health plans following such termination or resignation of employment, then the Company shall pay the COBRA premiums necessary to continue your health insurance coverage in effect for yourself and your eligible dependents on the termination date until the earliest of (A) the close of the twelve (12) month period following the termination of your employment, (B) the expiration of your eligibility for the continuation coverage under COBRA, or (C) the date when you become eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment or self-employment (such period from the termination date through the earliest of (A) through (C), the COBRA Payment Period ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the payment of the COBRA premiums could result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of providing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to instead pay you on the first day of each month of the COBRA Payment Period, a fully taxable cash payment equal to the COBRA premiums for that month, subject to applicable tax withholdings (such amount, the Special Severance Payment ), for the remainder of the COBRA Payment Period. You may, but are not obligated to, use such Special Severance Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums. On the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service, the Company will make the first payment under this clause (and, in the case of the Special Severance Payment, such payment will be paid to you in a lump sum) equal to the aggregate amount of payments that the Company would have paid through such date had such payments commenced on the Separation from Service through such sixtieth (60th) day, with the balance of the payments paid thereafter on the schedule described above. If you become eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, you must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause shall cease. (d) Termination Without Cause; Resignation With Good Reason During the Change of Control Period. If the Company terminates your employment without Cause or you resign for Good Reason, and other than any termination of your employment as a result of your death or disability, in each case within fifty-nine (59) days prior to or twenty-four (24) months following the effective date of a Change of Control (as defined herein) (the Change of Control Period ), and provided such termination constitutes a Separation from Service, then subject to 

4 US-DOCS\152924433.1 your obligations below, you shall be entitled to receive the following severance benefits (collectively, the Change of Control Severance Benefits in lieu of the Severance Benefits (and for the avoidance of doubt, in no event will you be entitled to both the Severance Benefits and the Change of Control Severance Benefits): (i) an amount equal to eighteen (18) months of your then current base salary (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your base salary which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the base salary in effect prior to such material diminution), less all applicable withholdings and deductions, to be paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service (the Change of Control Salary Severance (ii) an amount equal to 150 of your Target Bonus for the calendar year in which your termination occurs (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your Target Bonus which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the Target Bonus in effect prior to such material diminution), less all applicable withholdings and deductions, paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service; (iii) an amount equal to your Target Bonus for the calendar year in which your termination occurs (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment, or in the case of a material diminution in your Target Bonus which would give rise to Good Reason for your resignation, the Target Bonus in effect prior to such material diminution), prorated for the portion of the year that has elapsed through your date of termination of employment with the Company, less all applicable withholdings and deductions, paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service; (iv) if you timely elect continued coverage under COBRA for yourself and your covered dependents under the Company s group health plans following such termination or resignation of employment, then the Company shall pay the COBRA premiums necessary to continue your health insurance coverage in effect for yourself and your eligible dependents on the termination date until the earliest of (A) the close of the eighteen (18) month period following the termination of your employment, (B) the expiration of your eligibility for the continuation coverage under COBRA, or (C) the date when you become eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment or self-employment (such period from the termination date through the earliest of (A) through (C), the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the payment of the COBRA premiums could result in a violation of the nondiscrimination rules of Section 105(h)(2) of the Code or any statute or regulation of similar effect (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of providing the COBRA premiums, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to instead pay you on the first day of each month of the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period, the Special Severance Payment, for the remainder of the Change of Control COBRA Payment Period. You may, but are not obligated to, use such Special Severance Payment toward the cost of COBRA premiums. On the sixtieth (60th) day following your Separation from Service, the Company will make the first 

5 US-DOCS\152924433.1 payment under this clause (and, in the case of the Special Severance Payment, such payment will be paid to you in a lump sum) equal to the aggregate amount of payments that the Company would have paid through such date had such payments commenced on the Separation from Service through such sixtieth (60th) day, with the balance of the payments paid thereafter on the schedule described above. If you become eligible for coverage under another employer s group health plan or otherwise cease to be eligible for COBRA during the period provided in this clause, you must immediately notify the Company of such event, and all payments and obligations under this clause shall cease; and (v) acceleration of 100 of any unvested time-based Stock Awards. Such acceleration shall be effective as of the later of (A) the effective date of your Separation from Service, or (B) the date of such Change of Control (for the avoidance of doubt, the accelerated vesting of any Stock Awards that are performance-based shall be governed by the applicable equity plan and agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award pursuant to which they were granted). The foregoing provisions are hereby deemed to be a part of each Stock Award and to supersede any less favorable provision in any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if any Stock Award is subject to more favorable vesting pursuant to any agreement or plan regarding such Stock Award, such more favorable provisions shall continue to apply and shall not be limited by this clause (v)). (e) Conditions For Receipt of Severance Benefits or Change of Control Severance Benefits. The Severance Benefits or Change of Control Severance Benefits are conditional upon (x) your continuing to comply with your obligations under your Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement; (y) your delivering to the Company an effective, general release of claims in favor of the Company in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Release ), and any revocation period thereunder having expired, within sixty (60) days following your termination date; and (z) if you are a member of the Board, your resignation from the Board, to be effective no later than the date of your termination date (or such other date as requested by the Board). (f) No Mitigation. You shall not be required in any way to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7, including, without limitation, by seeking other employment, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 7 be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of employment with another employer after the termination date of employment, or otherwise. (g) Definitions. (i) Definition of Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean one or more of the following: (A) your willful failure substantially to perform your duties and responsibilities to the Company or deliberate violation of a Company policy (B) your commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other willful misconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in material injury to the Company; (C) your unauthorized use or disclosure of any proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company or any other party to whom you owe an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of your relationship with the Company; or (D) your willful breach of any of your obligations under any written 

6 US-DOCS\152924433.1 agreement or covenant with the Company. The determination as to whether you are being terminated for Cause shall be made in good faith by the Board. The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the Company s ability to terminate your employment at any time. (ii) Definition of Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall mean your resignation from employment with the Company if any of the following actions are taken by the Company without your prior written consent: (A) a material reduction in your base salary or Target Bonus if such a reduction is not made in proportion to an across-the-board reduction for all senior executives of the Company (and for the avoidance of doubt, following a Change of Control, the reference to senior executives of the Company shall include, without limitation, the senior executives of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor)); (B) a material reduction or material adverse change in your duties, responsibilities and/or authorities including, without limitation, following a Change of Control, your ceasing to report to the chief executive officer of the ultimate parent entity of the Company (or its successor), and/or your ceasing to serve as the Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary of such ultimate parent entity; provided that, prior to a Change of Control, it shall not constitute Good Reason if such reduction is a mere change of title alone or change in reporting relationship; (C) relocation of your principal place of employment to a place that increases your one-way commute by more than fifty (50) miles as compared to your then- current principal place of employment immediately prior to such relocation; or (D) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement or any agreement under which you provide services. Provided, however that, such termination by you shall only be deemed for Good Reason pursuant to the foregoing definition if (i) the Company is given written notice from you within ninety (90) days following the first occurrence of the condition that you consider to constitute Good Reason describing the condition and the Company fails to satisfactorily remedy such condition within thirty (30) days following such written notice, and (ii) you terminate employment within ninety (90) days following the end of the period within which the Company was entitled to remedy the condition constituting Good Reason but failed to do so. (iii) Definition of Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, Change of Control shall have the meaning given to such term in the Company s 2020 Incentive Award Plan as in effect on the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control would give rise to a payment or settlement event with respect to any payment or benefit that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation, the transaction or event constituting the Change of Control must also constitute a change in control event (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)) in order to give rise to the payment or settlement event for such payment or benefit, to the extent required by Section 409A. 

7 US-DOCS\152924433.1 (iv) Definition of Stock Awards. For purposes of this Agreement, Stock Awards shall mean all stock options, restricted stock and such other awards granted pursuant to the Company s stock option and equity incentive award plans or agreements and any shares of stock issued upon exercise thereof. 8. Section 409A. It is intended that all of the severance benefits and other payments payable under this Agreement satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A- 1(b)(5) and 1.409A-1(b)(9), and this Agreement will be construed to the greatest extent possible as consistent with those provisions, and to the extent not so exempt, this Agreement (and any definitions hereunder) will be construed in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A. For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), your right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if you are deemed by the Company at the time of your Separation from Service to be a specified employee for purposes of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), and if any of the payments upon Separation from Service set forth herein and/or under any other agreement with the Company are deemed to be deferred compensation , then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments shall not be provided to you prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of your Separation from Service with the Company, (ii) the date of your death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation. Upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum to you, and any remaining payments due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein or in the applicable agreement. No interest shall be due on any amounts so deferred. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under the Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A to the extent that such reimbursements or in- kind benefits are subject to Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirements that (A) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during your lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (B) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (C) the reimbursement of any eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (D) the right to reimbursement is not subject to set off or liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent any payments to you pursuant to this Agreement constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code or are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), then, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code or to satisfy such exception, no amount shall be payable pursuant to such sections unless your termination of employment constitutes a Separation from Service. 

8 US-DOCS\152924433.1 9. Parachute Payments. (a) Best Pay Provision. In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by you pursuant to the terms of any plan, arrangement or agreement (including any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in ownership or control or the termination of your employment) (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter referred to as the Total Payments would be subject (in whole or part) to the excise tax (the Excise Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (after subtracting the amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which you would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). Except to the extent that an alternative reduction order would result in a greater economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis, the Parties intend that the Total Payments shall be reduced in the following order: (w) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (x) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to you that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, (y) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to you on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and (z) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code; provided, in case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that reduction of any payments or benefits attributable to the acceleration of vesting of Company equity awards shall be first applied to equity awards with later vesting dates; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner. (b) Determinations. All determinations regarding the application of this Section 9 shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the 280G Firm ). For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which (x) does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason 

9 US-DOCS\152924433.1 of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, or (y) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which you shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the 280G Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. All determinations related to the calculations to be performed pursuant to this Section 9 shall be done by the 280G Firm in consultation with the Company. The 280G Firm will be directed to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after notification from either the Company or you that you may receive payments which may be parachute payments. You and the Company will each provide the 280G Firm access to and copies of any books, records, and documents as may be reasonably requested by the 280G Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the 280G Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the 280G Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by this Agreement will be borne solely by the Company. 10. Confidentiality Obligations. (a) Confidentiality Obligations. In connection with your employment, you have signed and agreed to abide by the Company s standard form of Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B (the Confidentiality Agreement ). In your work for the Company, you are expected not to use or disclose any confidential information, including trade secrets, of any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. Rather, you are expected to use only that information which is generally known and used by persons with training and experience comparable to your own, which is common knowledge in the industry or otherwise legally in the public domain, or which is otherwise provided or developed by the Company. You agree that you will not bring onto Company premises any unpublished documents or property belonging to any former employer or other person to whom you have an obligation of confidentiality. You hereby represent that your employment does not create a conflict with any agreement between you and a third party. (b) Other Protections. You acknowledge that the Company has provided you with the following notice of immunity rights in compliance with the requirements of the Defend Trade Secrets Act: (i) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; (ii) you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of confidential information that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and (iii) if you file a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, you may disclose the confidential information to your attorney and use the 

10 US-DOCS\152924433.1 confidential information in the court proceeding, if you file any document containing the confidential information under seal, and do not disclose the confidential information, except pursuant to court order. In addition, nothing in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent you from (x) communicating directly with, cooperating with, or providing information to, or receiving financial awards from, any federal, state or local government agency, including without limitation the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, without notifying or seeking permission from the Company, (y) exercising any rights you may have under Section 7 of the U.S. National Labor Relations Act, such as the right to engage in concerted activity, including collective action or discussion concerning wages or working conditions, or (z) discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination based on a protected characteristic or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful. 11. Arbitration. To ensure the timely and economical resolution of disputes that may arise in connection with your employment with the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Company agree that any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action arising from or relating to the enforcement, breach, performance, negotiation, execution, or interpretation of this Agreement, your employment, or the termination of your employment, including but not limited to statutory claims, shall be resolved pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1-16, or if inapplicable, the California Arbitration Act, and to the fullest extent permitted by law by final, binding and confidential arbitration, by a single neutral arbitrator in Marin County, California, chosen jointly by the parties, and will be conducted by JAMS, Inc. JAMS under the then applicable JAMS rules (which can be found at the following web address: https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/ or will be provided to you upon request without charge). If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator in accordance with JAMS rules. By agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both you and the Company waive the right to resolve any such dispute through a trial by jury or judge or administrative proceeding. The Company acknowledges that you will have the right to be represented by legal counsel at any arbitration proceeding. In addition, all claims, disputes, or causes of action under this paragraph, whether by you or the Company, must be brought in an individual capacity, and shall not be brought as a plaintiff (or claimant) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, nor joined or consolidated with the claims of any other person or entity. The arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person or entity, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. To the extent that the preceding sentences regarding class claims or proceedings are found to violate applicable law or are otherwise found unenforceable, any claim(s) alleged or brought on behalf of a class shall proceed in a court of law rather than by arbitration. This paragraph shall not apply to an action or claim brought in court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, as amended. The arbitrator shall: (a) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (b) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any or all remedies that you or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law. The Company shall pay all JAMS arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required of you if the dispute were filed in Superior Court. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either you or the 

11 US-DOCS\152924433.1 Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. Any awards or orders in such arbitrations may be entered and enforced as judgments in the federal and state courts of any competent jurisdiction. 12. Successors. This Agreement is intended to bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by you and the Company, and our respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators, except that you may not assign any of your duties or rights hereunder without the express written consent of the Company. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the Company s business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform any of the Company s obligations under this Agreement. 13. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto, is the complete and exclusive statement of all of the terms and conditions of your employment with the Company, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior agreements or representations with regard to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral, including, without limitation, the Prior Agreement. It is entered into without reliance on any promise or representation other than those expressly contained herein, and it cannot be modified, amended or extended except in a writing signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein. This Agreement and the terms of your employment with the Company shall be governed in all aspects by the laws of the State of California. 14. Indemnification. You will receive defense and be indemnified by the Company to the full extent of the provisions of the Company s charter and bylaws and applicable California and Delaware law and the Indemnification Agreement between you and the Company attached hereto as Exhibit C. 15. Withholding and other Deductions. All compensation payable to you hereunder shall be subject to such deductions as the Company is from time to time required to make pursuant to law, governmental regulation or order. 16. Notices. All notices or other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally or one (1) business day after being sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, charges prepaid. Notices also may be given electronically via PDF and shall be effective on the date transmitted if confirmed within forty-eight (48) hours thereafter by a signed original sent in the manner provided in the preceding sentence. Notice to you shall be sent to your most recent residence and personal email address on file with the Company. Notice to the Company shall be sent to its physical address set forth on the first page hereto and addressed to the Chief Executive Officer at the email address provided by the Company for such person.
