Statements in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute forward-looking statements. OVERVIEW The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 1, 1999 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. Going Concern To date the Company has little operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on director s support and raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through this or any other offerings. PLAN OF OPERATION We generated revenues of 6 and 206,073 from our business for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We operate an online ticketing platform named Gagfare.com, which provides a ticketing system for individuals and agencies to search, book and issue flight tickets and other services. 4 Table of Contents The Company is operating a travel services business, which includes an online ticketing platform Gagfare, which provides to travelers a Book Now, Pay Later business model, for travelers to secure the best fares and reserve flights well ahead of time.

The curated collection of boutique properties, each with a focus on diving, sustainability, conservation, and cultural authenticity, offers a thoroughly contemporary travel experience that is intrinsically linked to the destination, its heritage and its culture.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and note Use of estimates and assumptions In preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Revenue recognition The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). Under ASC 606, a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a customer. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for goods or services. Under the standard, a contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: identify the contract with a customer; identify the performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. The transaction price is included in the website and the customers bookings are deemed to be acceptance of the contract. The transaction price is fixed, and there is no variable consideration. The management has assessed its performance obligations as a single performance obligation and revenue is recorded upon the transfer of control of the services to the customer. The Company records its revenue from booking income upon the ticket booking service is rendered to travelers. The Company also records its revenue from the sale of air tickets upon confirmation and issuance of tickets to the travelers. The Company follows the guidance provided in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent in arrangements with customers that involve another party that contributes to the provision of goods to a customer. In these instances, the Company determines whether it has promised to provide the goods itself (as principal) or to arrange for the specified goods and services to be provided by another party (as an agent). This determination is a matter of judgment that depends on the facts and circumstances of each arrangement. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its air tickets on a gross basis as the Company is responsible for the fulfillment, controls the delivery of the promised goods, and has full discretion in establishing prices and therefore is the principal in the arrangement. 8 Table of Contents Related parties The Company follows the ASC 850-10, Related Party for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825 10 15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business.
