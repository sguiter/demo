million (excluding restricted cash of million), negative working capital of million
and a history of net operating losses. The Company has financed its operations principally through issuances of convertible debt, promissory
notes and equity securities. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for at least one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

The condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly,
the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern
and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

In making this assessment
management performed a comprehensive analysis of the Company s current circumstances, including its financial position, cash flow
and cash usage forecasts, as well as obligations and debts. Although management has a long history of successful capital raises, the analysis
used to determine the Company s ability as a going concern does not include cash sources beyond the Company s direct control
that management expects to be available within the next 12 months. 

Management expects that the
Company s existing cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, will not be
sufficient to enable the Company to fund its anticipated level of operations through one year from the date these financial statements
are issued. Management anticipates raising additional capital through the private and public sales of the Company s equity or debt
securities and selling its marketable securities as well as crypto assets, or a combination thereof. Although management believes that
such capital sources will be available, there can be no assurances that financing will be available to the Company when needed in order
to allow the Company to continue its operations, or if available, on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company does not raise sufficient
capital in a timely manner, among other things, the Company may be forced to scale back or cease its operations altogether. 

The non-cash consideration in the form of transaction fees paid by transaction requestors is based on
the share of standard transaction fees over the daily 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC. The pool operator
calculates the standard transaction fee during the 24-hour period using a rolling 144 block moving average of actual transaction fees. 

The block reward and transaction fees earned by the Company are reduced by mining pool fees charged by
the operator for operating the pool based on a rate schedule per the mining pool contract. The mining pool fee is only incurred to the
extent the Company performs hash calculations and generates revenue in accordance with the pool operator s payout formula during
the same 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC daily. 

The contract is in effect
until terminated by either party. 

All consideration pursuant
to this arrangement is variable. It is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will occur. The Company is able
to calculate the payout based on the contractual formula, non-cash revenue is estimated and recognized based on the fair value of Bitcoin
on the date of contract inception. Fair value of the crypto assets consideration is determined using the midnight UTC spot price of the
Company s principal market for Bitcoin. The Company recognizes non-cash consideration on the same day that control of the contracted
service is transferred to the pool operator, which is the same day as the contract inception. 

There is no significant financing
component in these transactions. 

Expenses associated with running
the crypto assets mining business, such as equipment depreciation and electricity costs, are recorded as a component of cost of revenues. 

Revenue Recognition
Hotel Operations 

The
primary sources of revenue include room and food and beverage revenue from the Company s hotels. 

Rooms
revenue represents revenue from the occupancy of the Company s hotel rooms, which is driven by the occupancy and average daily rate
charged. Rooms revenue includes revenue from guest no-shows, daily use, and early/late departure fees. The contracts for room stays with
customers are generally short in duration and revenues are recognized as services are provided over the course of the hotel stay at the
daily transaction price agreed to under the contract. 

Food
and beverage revenue consists of revenue from the restaurants and lounges, in room dining and mini bars, and banquet/catering revenue
from group and social functions. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately when the customer purchases the goods and services.
Therefore, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the physical possession has transferred to the customer. 

Reclassifications 

Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the current-period financial statement presentation,
including the discontinued operations presentation of GIGA financial results. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported
results of operations. 

In March 2024, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2024-01 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards ASU
2024-01 ). ASU 2024-01 improves clarity and operability without changing the guidance. ASU 2024-01 is effective on a prospective
basis, with the option for retrospective application, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and early adoption is permitted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2024-01 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

million included in net gain (loss) from discontinued operations. 

In connection with the Chapter
11 reorganization process , the Company concluded that the operations of GIGA met the criteria for discontinued operations as this
strategic shift that will have a significant effect on the Company s operations and financial results. As a result, the Company
has presented the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of GIGA as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements and notes for all periods presented.

The Company assesses the inputs
used to measure fair value using the three-tier hierarchy based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable
in the market. For investments where little or no public market exists, management s determination of fair value is based on the
best available information which may incorporate management s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking
into consideration various factors including earnings history, financial condition, recent sales prices of the issuer s securities
and liquidity risks. 

The changes in Level 3 fair
value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

There was no activity in the
investment in the unconsolidated entity account during the three months ended September 30, 2024, prior to the transition from the equity

Stock and its Series C Convertible Preferred Stock; and all equity securities issued by the Company expressly designated as ranking senior
to the Series E Preferred Stock; and (4) junior to all the Company s existing and future indebtedness. 

To the extent the shares
of Series E Preferred Stock are issued, the Company will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock when, as and if
declared by its board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of its board of directors), only out of funds legally available for
payment of dividends. Dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock will accrue on the stated amount of 25.00 per share of the Series E Preferred
Stock at a rate per annum equal to 10.00 (equivalent to 3.00 per year), payable monthly in arrears. 

The Series E Preferred Stock

respect to material and adverse changes in the terms of the Series E Preferred Stock and the creation of additional classes or series
of preferred stock that rank senior to the Series E Preferred Stock. 

Further, unless the Company
has received the approval of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Series E Preferred Stock, the Company will
not effect any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification of the Series E Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation
of the Company with another entity, unless (a) the shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of a merger or
consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving entity, the shares of Series E Preferred Stock are converted into
or exchanged for preference securities, or (b) such shares remain outstanding or such preference securities are not materially less favorable
than the Series E Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation.

an original issue discount of 0.2 million. The Notes accrue interest at the rate of 6 per annum, unless an event of default (as

2 

On June 4, 2024, we entered into a Loan
Agreement (the 2024 Credit Agreement with OREE Lending Company, LLC and Helios Funds LLC, as lenders. The 2024 Credit Agreement
provides for an unsecured, non-revolving credit facility in an aggregate draw limit of up to 20.0 million, provided, however, that at
no point will we be allowed to have outstanding loans under the 2024 Credit Agreement in a principal amount received of more than 2.0
million. The lenders made a loan to the Company of 1.5 million on June 4, 2024. The loans under the 2024 Credit Agreement are due
December 4, 2024, provided, however, that if on such date, we have executed an equity line of credit agreement relating to the sale of
shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, which was executed on June 20, 2024, have an effective registration statement relating thereto
and are not currently in default under such agreement, then the maturity date shall be automatically extended until June 4, 2025. The
lenders are not obligated to make any further loans under the 2024 Credit Agreement after the maturity date described above. Loans under
the 2024 Credit Agreement will be evidenced by promissory notes (the Promissory Notes and will include the addition of
an original issuance discount of 20 to the amount of each loan and all loans will bear interest at the rate of 15.0 per annum and may

On June 23, 2024,
Ault Disruptive entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time,
the Merger Agreement by and among Ault Disruptive, ADRT Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Ault Disruptive Merger Sub ), and Gresham Worldwide, Inc., a California corporation GIGA ).
The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are referred to herein as the Business Combination. 

Pursuant to the
Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Merger Sub was intended to merge with and into GIGA (the
 Merger ), with GIGA being the surviving corporation and thereby becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Ault Disruptive. Upon
the Closing of the Business Combination (the Effective Time ), it was expected that Ault Disruptive would be renamed Gresham
Worldwide, Inc., and thereafter remain listed on the NYSE American under a new ticker symbol, GWWI. 

However, on August
14, 2024, GIGA filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws. Consequently, Ault Disruptive was required
to terminate the Merger Agreement, which it did on August 15, 2024. Ault Disruptive does not presently intend to enter into a new
agreement and plan of merger with a third party. 

On September 27, 2024, Ault Disruptive announced
that it will redeem all of its outstanding shares of common stock which occurred as of the close of business on October 11, 2024, because
Ault Disruptive would not consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by its Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation, as amended. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, shares of Ault Disruptive common stock were redeemed for
an aggregate redemption amount of 1.5 million. 

On October 11, 2024, all remaining shares
of Ault Disruptive common stock were redeemed for a redemption amount of 0.8 million. 

On July 18, 2024, we entered into a note
purchase agreement with an institutional investor pursuant to which the institutional investor agreed to acquire, and we agreed to issue
and sell in a registered direct offering to the institutional investor, a 5.4 million 10 OID Convertible Promissory Note (the OID
Note ). The OID Note was sold to the institutional investor for a purchase price of 4.9 million, an original issue discount
of 0.5 million. The OID Note will accrue interest at the rate of 15 per annum, unless an event of default occurs, at which time the
OID Note would accrue interest at 18 per annum. The OID Note will mature on October 19, 2024. In addition, the OID Note is convertible
at any time after NYSE American approval of a Supplemental Listing Application into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of
 0.22 per share (the OID Conversion Price ), subject to adjustment. However, we may not issue shares of common stock upon
conversion of the OID Note to the extent such issuance would result in an aggregate number of shares of common stock exceeding 19.99 
of the total shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of July 18, 2024, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the New
York Stock Exchange (the NYSE Limit unless we first obtain stockholder approval Stockholder Approval ). 

If, on September 2, 2024 (the Adjustment
Date ), the closing bid price of our common stock is lower than the OID Conversion Price, then the OID Conversion Price will be
reduced to 85 of the closing bid price of the common stock on September 2, 2024. However, if after July 19, 2024, and prior to the date
on which Stockholder Approval is obtained, the holder of the OID Note has converted a portion of the outstanding amount under the OID
Note into shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount equal to the NYSE Limit, then the Adjustment Date will be extended by such
number of days between such date and the date on which we obtain Stockholder Approval. 

On September 17,
2024, the loan and guarantee agreement, dated as of December 14, 2023, as amended, pursuant to which we have guaranteed financial obligations
of Ault Company borrowings, was amended regarding our obligations to fund the restricted cash Segregated Account. 

3 

We agreed to deposit in the Segregated Account:
(i) 0.4 million monthly commencing on September 30, 2024 and ending on February 28, 2025; and (ii) 0.5 million monthly commencing
on March 31, 2025 and ending on the earlier of the term loan maturity date, prepayment of the term loan in full or the date on which the
balance of the Segregated Account exceeds 110 of the outstanding balance of the term loan. As of September 30, 2024 we had deposited
 6.5 million in the Segregated Account. In October 2024, we deposited an additional 0.4 million in the Segregated Account. 

On August 2, 2024, pursuant to the November
2023 SPA we entered into with Ault Company, we sold 300 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase
0.1 million shares of common stock to Ault Company, for a purchase price of 0.3 million. 

In October
and November 2024, we sold to Ault Company an aggregate of 2,230 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase 0.7
million shares of Class A common stock, for a total purchase price of 2.2 million. 

On November
11, 2024 we filed a Certificate of Designation, Rights and Preferences (the Certificate of Designation with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware to establish the preferences, voting powers, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications,
terms and conditions of redemption and other terms and conditions of our Series E Preferred Stock. The following is a summary description
of those terms and the general effect of the issuance of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock on our other classes of registered securities. 

The Series
E Preferred Stock will, as to dividend rights and rights as to the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up,
rank: (1) senior to all classes or series of Common Stock and to all other equity securities issued by us other than equity securities
referred to in clauses (2) and (3); (2) on parity with any future class or series of our equity securities expressly designated as ranking
on parity with the Series E Preferred Stock, (3) junior to our Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock and its Series
C Convertible Preferred Stock; and all equity securities issued by us expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series E Preferred
Stock; and (4) junior to all our existing and future indebtedness. 

To the extent
the shares of Series E Preferred Stock are issued, we will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock when, as and
if declared by its board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of its board of directors), only out of funds legally available
for payment of dividends. Dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock will accrue on the stated amount of 25.00 per share of the Series
E Preferred Stock at a rate per annum equal to 10.00 (equivalent to 3.00 per year), payable monthly in arrears. 

The Series
E Preferred Stock is redeemable by us. Holders of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock generally will have no voting rights, except
as required by law and as provided in the Certificate of Designation. Voting rights for holders of the Series E Preferred Stock exist
primarily with respect to material and adverse changes in the terms of the Series E Preferred Stock and the creation of additional classes
or series of preferred stock that rank senior to the Series E Preferred Stock. 

Further, unless
we have received the approval of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Series E Preferred Stock, we will not effect
any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification of the Series E Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of us with
another entity, unless (a) the shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of a merger or consolidation with
respect to which we are not the surviving entity, the shares of Series E Preferred Stock are converted into or exchanged for preference
securities, or (b) such shares remain outstanding or such preference securities are not materially less favorable than the Series E Preferred
Stock immediately prior to such consummation. 

At the June
28, 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, voted upon and approved Proposal 5, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect
a Reverse Split with a ratio of not less than one-for-two and not more than one-for-thirty-five at any time prior to June 27, 2025, with
the exact ratio to be set at a whole number within this range as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion. 

On October
24, 2024, the board of directors authorized a special committee of the board to determine the ratio of the reverse split. On November
8, 2024, the special committee approved a one-for-thirty-five reverse split of the Class A common stock that will be effective in the
State of Delaware on Friday, November 22, 2024. We anticipate that beginning with the opening of trading on Monday, November 25, 2024,
our Class A common stock will trade on the NYSE American on a split-adjusted basis. 

On November
15, 2024, we announced that we plan to issue a special one-time dividend (the Distribution of 5.0 million shares of our
Class B Common Stock (the Class B Common Stock to all holders of our Class A Common Stock (the Class A Common Stock and the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. 

The record
date for the Distribution is November 29, 2024. Stockholders who own our Class A Common Stock at the close of trading on that date will
be eligible to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock. Further, we have set a payment date of December 16, 2024, subject to adjustment.
On the record date, we anticipate there will be approximately 1.1 million shares of Class A Common Stock and approximately 5.9 million
Class A Common Stock equivalents, based on the current conversion price of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding
(collectively, the Eligible Capital Stock ), for an aggregate of approximately 7.0 million shares of Eligible Capital Stock.
Consequently, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock issuable is approximately 0.71 for each share of Eligible Capital Stock. The
foregoing figures reflect the implementation of the one-for-thirty-five reserve stock split that will be effectuated on November 25, 2024. 

The Class
B Common Stock is identical to the currently outstanding Class A Common Stock, with the exception that each share thereof carries ten
times the voting power of a share of Class A Common Stock. The Class B Common Stock is convertible at any time after the payment date
into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.

Presentation of GIGA as Discontinued Operations 

On
August 14, 2024, our majority owned subsidiary, Gresham Worldwide, Inc. GIGA ), filed
a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws. The filing placed GIGA under the control of the bankruptcy court,
which oversees its reorganization and restructuring process. We assessed the inherent uncertainties associated with the outcome of the
Chapter 11 reorganization process and the anticipated duration thereof, and concluded that it was appropriate to deconsolidate GIGA and
its subsidiaries effective on the petition date. We recognized a gain on deconsolidation of GIGA of 2.0 million included in net gain
(loss) from discontinued operations. 

In connection with the Chapter
11 reorganization process , we concluded that the operations of GIGA met the criteria for discontinued operations as this strategic
shift that will have a significant effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, we have presented the results of operations,
cash flows and financial position of GIGA as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes for
all periods presented. 

Change in Plan of Sales of AGREE Hotel Properties 

On April 30, 2024, we had a change in plan
of sale for our four hotels owned and operated by AGREE. As a result, as of April 30, 2024, the assets no longer met the held for sale
criteria and were required to be reclassified as held and used at the lower of adjusted carrying value or the fair value at the date of
the not to sell. 

For presentation purposes, the assets and
liabilities previously held for sale as of December 31, 2023, were reclassified in the December 31, 2023 balance sheet in the accompanying
financial statements back to their original asset and liability groups at their previous carrying values. In connection with this change
in plan of sale, we recorded a loss on impairment of property and equipment related to the real estate assets of AGREE of 8.0 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

General 

As a holding company, our business objective
is to increase stockholder value through developing and growing our subsidiaries. Under the strategy we have adopted, we are focused on
managing and financially supporting our existing subsidiaries and partner companies, with the goal of pursuing monetization opportunities
and maximizing the value returned to stockholders. We have, are and will consider initiatives including, among others: public offerings,
the sale of individual partner companies, the sale of certain or all partner company interests in secondary market transactions, or a
combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize stockholder value. We anticipate returning value to stockholders after
satisfying our debt obligations and working capital needs. 

From time to time, we engage in discussions
with other companies interested in our subsidiaries or partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate.
To the extent we believe that a subsidiary or partner company s further growth and development can best be supported by a different
ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our stockholders best interests, we will seek to sell all or a portion
of our position in the subsidiary or partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets,
mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the subsidiary or partner company s securities and, in the case of publicly traded
partner companies, sales of their securities in the open market. Our plans may include taking subsidiaries or partner companies public
through rights offerings and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these (or similar) initiatives and the
sale of certain subsidiary or partner company interests in secondary market transactions to maximize value for our stockholders. 

In recent years, we have provided capital and relevant expertise to
fuel the growth of businesses in metaverse platform, oil exploration, crane services, defense/aerospace, industrial, automotive, medical/biopharma
and hotel operations. We have provided capital to subsidiaries as well as partner companies in which we have an equity interest or may
be actively involved, influencing development through board representation and management support.

Sentinum 

Revenues from Sentinum s crypto assets
mining operations decreased by 2.2 million, primarily due to an estimated 5.3 million unfavorable impact from the April 19, 2024 Bitcoin
halving event on the Bitcoin network, coupled with a 76 increase in the average Bitcoin mining difficulty level for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This decrease was partially offset by a 128 increase in the average
Bitcoin price and a 0.3 million reduction in revenue from Sentinum s crypto mining equipment hosted at third-party facilities for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 

Halving is a key part of the Bitcoin protocol
and serves to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in crypto assets using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm.
The Bitcoin halving event reduced the block subsidy by half from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin. Transaction fees were not directly impacted by
the halving. 

Energy 

Energy revenues from Circle 8 s crane
operations decreased by 0.2 million, or 1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, remaining essentially flat compared to the
prior period. 

Fintech 

Revenues from our
lending and trading activities were 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, driven primarily by 2.6 million in realized
gains from trading activities, 2.6 million in fee income, and 0.6 million in unrealized gains on investment positions. In comparison,
revenues from lending and trading activities for the same period in 2023 were negative 0.2 million, due to a 3.0 million unrealized
loss from our investment in Alzamend and 0.8 million in net unrealized losses on investments in marketable equity securities, partially
offset by 3.0 million in realized gains from trading activities and 0.5 million dividend income. 

Revenues from our
trading activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included net gains on equity securities, including unrealized gains and
losses from market price changes. These gains and losses have caused, and will continue to cause, significant volatility in our periodic
earnings. 

7 

SMC 

Due
to the significant change in our ownership and voting rights, we determined that we no longer met the criteria of the primary beneficiary
and, accordingly, we deconsolidated SMC as of November 20, 2023. SMC revenues were 0 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, a decrease of 15.9 million compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 

TurnOnGreen 

TurnOnGreen's revenues increased by 0.1
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This rise was primarily due to higher
sales from a single, higher-margin customer in the defense industry during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Gross Margins 

Gross margins rose to 28 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20 for the same period in 2023. This increase was influenced by our lending and trading
activities, which contributed favorably in 2024 but had a negative impact in 2023. In both periods, gross margins were adversely affected
by negative margins from our crypto assets mining operations. Excluding the impacts of both our lending and trading activities and our
crypto assets mining operations, adjusted gross margins for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 would have been 38 and
33 , respectively. Gross margins improved due to the deconsolidation of the lower margin of SMC business. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses increased
by 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increased expenditures related to development work on ROI s
BitNile gaming platform. 

Selling and Marketing 

Selling and marketing expenses were 4.8
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 2.9 million, or 38 . The decrease was primarily the result of a 2.0 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses at ROI primarily
due to lower advertising and promotion costs and a 1.2 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses from SMC due to the deconsolidation
of SMC as of November 20, 2023 . 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses were
 12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023,
a decrease of 4.3 million, or 27 . General and administrative expenses decreased from the comparative prior period, mainly due to the
following: 

2.8 million decrease in general and administrative expenses from SMC due to the deconsolidation
of SMC as of November 20, 2023; 

1.4 million lower professional fees; and 

1.4 million lower salaries and benefits. 

Partially offset by: 

1.0 million higher operating expenses at AGREE; and 

0.9 million higher operating expenses at Circle 8. 

Impairment of Property and Equipment 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, due to increases in the Bitcoin mining difficulty level, which compounded the continued impact of the Bitcoin halving
event, we concluded that indicated that an impairment triggering event had occurred. Testing performed indicated the estimated fair value
of our miners to be less than their net carrying value as of September 30, 2024, and an impairment charge of 10.5 million was recognized,
decreasing the net carrying value of our crypto assets mining equipment to their estimated fair value. 

In addition, we recorded 1.2
million in impairment charges related to real estate assets of AGREE during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Other expense, net was 7.2 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expense, net of 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

Interest and other income was 0.8 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

8 

Interest expense was 7.8 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 included contractual interest of 5.4 million, amortization of debt discount of 1.4 million and
forbearance and extension fees of 1.1 million. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included contractual interest
of 5.0 million, amortization of debt discount of 0.6 million and forbearance and extension fees of 0.5 million. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2024, an investor converted 0.7 million of a convertible note into 3.0 million shares of Class A common stock that had a fair value
of 0.9 million at the time of conversion and we recognized a 0.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt. 

Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 

The income tax provision (benefit) was 52,000
and 0.6) million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax provision (benefit)
rate was 0.2 and (2.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower income tax provision during the
three months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to lower dividend income compared to the prior year period as a result of the
decline in cash and marketable securities held in the trust account as a result of redemptions of Ault Disruptive common stock subject
to possible redemption.

Sentinum 

Revenues from Sentinum s crypto assets
mining operations increased 4.2 million due primarily to a 3.5 million increase in revenue from Sentinum crypto mining equipment hosted
at third-party facilities and a 128 increase in the average Bitcoin price, partially offset by an 76 increase in the average Bitcoin
mining difficulty level for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023, and an 9.7 million
unfavorable impact from the April 19, 2024 Bitcoin halving event occurred on the Bitcoin network. 

Energy 

Energy revenues from Circle 8 s crane
operations decreased by 0.8 million, or 2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, remaining essentially flat compared to the
prior period. This decrease was primarily due to lower utilization of the crane fleet, as five cranes were out of service during the three
months ended June 30, 2024. 

Fintech 

Revenues from our
lending and trading activities were 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven primarily by 2.5 million in realized
gains from trading activities and 2.7 million in fee income, partially offset by a 0.6 million unrealized loss from our investment in
Alzamend. In comparison, revenues from lending and trading activities for the same period in 2023 were 4.3 million, driven primarily
by 8.5 million in net realized and unrealized gains on investments in marketable equity securities and 1.6 million in dividend income,
partially offset by a 3.6 million unrealized loss from our investment in Alzamend and a 2.0 million impairment for equity securities
that do not have readily determinable fair values related to Fintech lending operations. 

Revenues from our
trading activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included net gains on equity securities, including unrealized gains and
losses from market price changes. These gains and losses have caused, and will continue to cause, significant volatility in our periodic
earnings. 

SMC 

Due
to the significant change in our ownership and voting rights, we determined that we no longer met the criteria of the primary beneficiary
and, accordingly, we deconsolidated SMC as of November 20, 2023. SMC revenues were 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
a decrease of 21.9 million compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 

11 

TurnOnGreen 

TurnOnGreen's revenues increased by 1.0
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This rise was primarily due to higher
sales from a single, higher-margin customer in the defense industry during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Gross Margins 

Gross margins rose to 26 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to 23 for the same period in 2023. This increase was influenced by our lending and trading activities,
which contributed favorably to our gross margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In both periods, gross margins
were adversely affected by negative margins from our crypto assets mining operations. Excluding the impacts of both our lending and trading
activities and our crypto assets mining operations, adjusted gross margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 would
have been 36 and 33 , respectively. Gross margins improved due to the deconsolidation of the lower margin of SMC business. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses increased
by 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to increased expenditures primarily related to development work on ROI s
BitNile gaming platform. 

Selling and Marketing 

Selling and marketing expenses were 12.5
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of 12.5 million, or 48 . The decrease was primarily the result of an 10.2 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses at ROI primarily
due to lower advertising and promotion costs and a 2.4 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses from SMC due to the deconsolidation
of SMC as of November 20, 2023 . 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses were
 33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 53.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
a decrease of 19.3 million, or 36 . General and administrative expenses decreased from the comparative prior period, mainly due to the
following: 

7.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses from SMC due to the deconsolidation
of SMC as of November 20, 2023 ; 

4.6 million lower stock compensation expense; 

4.0 million lower salaries and benefits; 

1.2 million lower professional fees; and 

1.2 million lower performance bonus related to realized gains on trading activities. 

Impairment of Property and Equipment 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, due to increases in the Bitcoin mining difficulty level, which compounded the continued impact of the Bitcoin halving
event, we concluded that indicated that an impairment triggering event had occurred. Testing performed indicated the estimated fair value
of our miners to be less than their net carrying value as of September 30, 2024, and an impairment charge of 10.5 million was recognized,
decreasing the net carrying value of our crypto assets mining equipment to their estimated fair value. 

In addition, we recorded 9.2
million in impairment charges related to real estate assets of AGREE during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Other expense, net was 9.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expense, net of 37.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. 

Interest and other income was 2.1 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest
and other income is primarily due to the decline in Ault Disruptive s interest income as a result of the decline in cash and marketable
securities held in the trust account as a result of redemptions of Ault Disruptive common stock subject to possible redemption. 

Interest expense was 18.8 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 35.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 included contractual interest of 10.7 million, amortization of debt discount of 4.8 million, and
forbearance and extension fees of 3.3 million. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included amortization of
debt discount of 18.2 million, contractual interest of 9.6 million and forbearance and extension fees of 7.3 million. 

12 

Gain on conversion of investment in equity
securities to marketable equity securities of 17.9 million relates to ROI conversion of White River common stock. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, ROI transferred 14.5 million shares of White River common stock with a fair value of 19.2 million at the date
of transfer. In conjunction with the transfers, ROI converted a portion of their White River s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
into common stock and recorded a noncash 17.9 million gain on conversion. 

During the three months ended March 31,
2024, ROI converted 2.3 million of ROI senior secured convertible notes that had a fair value of 0.9 million at the time of conversion
and recognized a 1.4 million gain on extinguishment of debt. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, holders of our convertible
notes converted 2.0 million of convertible notes that had a fair value of 2.7 million at the time of conversion and recognized a 0.7
million loss on extinguishment of debt. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2024, an investor converted 0.7 million of a convertible note into 3.0 million shares of Class A common stock that had a fair value
of 0.9 million at the time of conversion and we recognized a 0.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt. 

Loss from investment in unconsolidated entity
was 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing our share of losses from our equity method investment in SMC. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, the provision for loan losses on the related party note receivable from Ault Company was 3.1 million, due to uncertainties
regarding collection. This compares to no provision for the same period in 2023. 

Cumulative downward adjustments for impairments
for our equity securities without readily determinable fair values held at were 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Income Tax Provision 

The income tax provision was 47,000 and
 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax provision rate was 0.1 
and 0.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower income tax provision during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 related primarily to lower dividend income compared to the prior year period as a result of the decline in cash and
marketable securities held in the trust account as a result of redemptions of Ault Disruptive common stock subject to possible redemption. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash
equivalents of 7.2 million (excluding restricted cash of 8.3 million), compared to cash and cash equivalents of 6.1 million (excluding
restricted cash of 5.0 million) at December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash provided by
financing activities related to the sale of common and preferred stock, as well as proceeds from notes payable and convertible notes,
partially offset by the payment of debt, purchases of property and equipment and cash used in operating activities. 

Net cash used in operating activities totaled
 10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 20.0 million proceeds from the sale of crypto
assets from our Sentinum crypto assets mining operations, offset by operating losses and changes in working capital. Net cash used in
operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 6.4 million cash used in operating activities from discontinued
operations. 

Net cash used in investing
activities was 11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to 4.8 million
capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 3.8 million cash used
in investing activities from discontinued operations. 

13 

Net cash provided by financing activities
was 22.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, and primarily reflects the following transactions: 

During the period between January 1, 2024 through March 13, 2024,
we sold an aggregate of 25.6 million shares of common stock pursuant to the At-The-Market issuance sales agreement, as amended, entered
into with Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC in 2023 (the 2023 Common ATM Offering for gross proceeds of 14.6 million and
effective March 14, 2024, the 2023 Common ATM Offering was terminated ; 

49.3 million proceeds from notes payable, partially offset by 47.0 million payments on notes payable; 

6.7 million proceeds from convertible notes payable, partially offset by 1.3 million payments on notes
payable; 

2.8 million proceeds from sales of Series C preferred stock, related
party; 

1.8 million proceeds from subsidiaries sale of stock to
non-controlling interests; 

3.9 million payments of preferred dividends; and 

1.9 million payments on notes payable, related party. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 2.6 million cash provided by financing activities from discontinued
operations. 

Financing Transactions Subsequent to September 30, 2024 

In October 2024, we sold
to Ault Company an aggregate of 1,400 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase 0.4 million shares of Class A
common stock, for a total purchase price of 1.4 million. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

There have been
no material changes to our critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable
for a smaller reporting company. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have established disclosure controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, with the assistance of other members of the Company s management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon our evaluation, each of our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of
the period covered by this Quarterly Report because the Company has not yet completed its remediation of the material weakness previously
identified and disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, the end of its most
recent fiscal year. 

Management has identified the following
material weaknesses: 

1. We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting department, which restricts our ability to gather,
analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting, including applying complex accounting principles relating to consolidation
accounting, related party transactions, fair value estimates, accounting contingencies and analysis of financial instruments for proper
classification in the consolidated financial statements, in a timely manner; 

14 

2. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not
be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of
transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties
during our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a
material weakness; 

3. Our primary user access controls (i.e., provisioning, de-provisioning, privileged access and user access
reviews) to ensure appropriate authorization and segregation of duties that would adequately restrict user and privileged access to the
financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel were not designed and/or implemented effectively. We did not design and/or
implement sufficient controls for program change management to certain financially relevant systems affecting our processes; and 

4. The Company did not design and/or implement user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of
duties or program change management controls for certain financially relevant systems impacting the Company s processes around revenue
recognition and crypto assets to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting the Company s (i) financial IT applications,
(ii) crypto assets mining equipment, and (iii) underlying accounting records, are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately
to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and accurate. Automated process-level controls and manual controls
that are dependent upon the information derived from such financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result
of such deficiency. In addition, the Company has not effectively designed a manual key control to detect material misstatements in revenue. 

Planned Remediation 

Management continues to work to improve
its controls related to our material weaknesses, specifically relating to user access and change management surrounding our IT systems
and applications. Management will continue to implement measures to remediate material weaknesses, such that these controls are designed,
implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) enhancing design and documentation related to both user access
and change management processes and control activities; and (ii) developing and communicating additional policies and procedures to govern
the area of IT change management. In order to achieve the timely implementation of the above, management has commenced the following actions
and will continue to assess additional opportunities for remediation on an ongoing basis: 

Engaging a third-party specialist to assist management with improving the Company s overall control
environment, focusing on change management and access controls; 

Implementing new applications and systems that are aligned with management s focus on creating strong
internal controls; and 

Continuing to increase headcount across the Company, with a particular focus on hiring individuals with
strong Sarbanes Oxley and internal control backgrounds. 

We are currently working to improve and
simplify our internal processes and implement enhanced controls, as discussed above, to address the material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. These material weaknesses
will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable remediated controls are operating for a sufficient period of time and management
has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Despite the existence of these material
weaknesses, we believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in the period covered by this Quarterly Report fairly
present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. 

Except as detailed above, during the fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Litigation Matters 

The Company is involved in litigation arising
from other matters in the ordinary course of business. We are regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations,
and other proceedings involving labor and employment, commercial disputes, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government
investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil penalties, or other adverse consequences. 

Certain of these outstanding matters include
speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has
been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of
loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount
of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments
as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related
to such matters. 

Arena Litigation 

Arena Investors, LP (ROI Litigation) 

On May 30, 2024, Arena Investors, LP Arena ),
in its capacity as collateral agent for five noteholders, filed a filed a Complaint (the ROI Complaint in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York against the Company and ROI, in action captioned Arena Investors, LP v. Ault Alliance,
Inc. and RiskOn International, Inc. , Index No. 652792/2024. 

The ROI Complaint asserts a cause of action
for breach of contract against the Company based on a Guaranty, dated April 27, 2023, and entered into, amongst others, the Company and
Arena, and seeks damages in the amount of in excess of 3.75 million, plus interest, attorneys fees, costs, expenses, and disbursements. 

The ROI Complaint also asserts a cause of
action for breach of contract against ROI based on an alleged breach of that certain Security Agreement, dated April 27, 2023, and entered
into among ROI and Arena. In connection with this cause of action, Arena seeks, among other things, costs and expenses from the Company
and ROI. 

On July 31, 2024, the Company and ROI filed
a motion to dismiss seeking to partially dismiss the ROI Complaint, as against the Company, and to dismiss the Compliant, in its entirety,
as against ROI. 

The Motion has been fully briefed and is
currently pending before the Court. 

Based on the Company s assessment
of the facts underlying the claims, the uncertainty of litigation, and the preliminary stage of the case, the Company cannot reasonably
estimate the potential loss or range of loss that may result from this action. Notwithstanding, the Company has recorded the unpaid portion
of the notes. An unfavorable outcome may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

Arena Investors, LP (Gresham Litigation) 

On June 6, 2024, Arena, in its capacity
as collateral agent for Arena and Walleye Opportunities Master Fund Ltd. Walleye ), filed a Complaint (the Complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York against the Company and GIGA, in action captioned Arena Investors,
LP v. Gresham Worldwide, Inc. f/k/a Giga-Tronics Incorporated and Ault Alliance, Inc. , Index No. 652898/2024. 

On July 8, 2024, Arena filed an Amended
Complaint (the Amended Complaint in the above-referenced action. The Amended Complaint asserts a cause of action
against the Company for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking an injunction enjoining the Company, and its agent, affiliates, servants,
and employees from taking actions in breach of that certain Subordination Agreement, dated January 9, 2023, and entered into among Walleye,
Arena, and the Company. 

16 

The Amended Complaint also asserts causes
of action for breach of contract against GIGA based on two discrete convertible promissory notes (the Notes that GIGA entered
into with each of Arena and Walleye, as well as a claim for breach duty of good faith and fair dealing, against GIGA, and seeks, among
other things, monetary damages in excess of 4.2 million, with interest thereon, attorneys fees, costs, and disbursements. 
The Amended Complaint further asserts another cause of action against GIGA for breach of contract seeking declaratory and injunctive relief
based on alleged inspection rights contained in a Security Agreement, dated January 9, 2023 (the Security Agreement ), and
entered into between the Walleye, Arena, and GIGA, which seeks the issuance of an injunction related to such alleged inspection rights,
plus the costs and out-of-pocket expenses associated with the enforcement of same. 

On July 12, 2024, the Court granted injunctive
relief to Arena and ordered GIGA to comply with the inspection rights provision of the Security Agreement by July 17, 2024. 

On July 19, 2024, Arena voluntarily discontinued
its cause of action for breach duty of good faith and fair dealing claim against GIGA. 

On July 29, 2024, the Company and GIGA filed
a motion to dismiss, strike, and for sanctions (the Motion ), in response to the Amended Complaint, on the grounds that,
amongst other things, the underlying Notes are criminally usurious under New York. 

On August 14, 2024, GIGA filed a petition
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws 

On November 12, 2024, GIGA removed the state
court action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. 

Based on the Company s assessment
of the facts underlying the claims, the uncertainty of litigation, and the preliminary stage of the case, the Company cannot reasonably
estimate the potential loss or range of loss that may result from this action. Notwithstanding, the Company has recorded the unpaid portion
of the Notes. An unfavorable outcome may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

Other Litigation Matters 

With respect to our other outstanding matters,
based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome
of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.
