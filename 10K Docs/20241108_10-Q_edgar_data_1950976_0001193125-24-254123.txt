The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of this Report. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods. Overview of Our Business We were formed on October 13, 2022 as a Maryland corporation. On October 11, 2023, we commenced operations and on October 18, 2023, we made our first portfolio company investment. We are externally managed by our Adviser, 26North Direct Lending LP, an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. As an externally managed BDC, we do not have any employees, and our investment and management functions are provided by an outside investment adviser and administrator under an advisory agreement and administration agreement. Instead of directly compensating employees, we pay the Adviser for investment and management services pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 26North Direct Lending Administration LLC serves as our Administrator. The Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Administrator has entered into a sub-administration agreement with SEI pursuant to which SEI receives compensation for its services. Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. We invest primarily in directly originated senior secured loans to middle market companies domiciled in the United States. The Company s portfolio consists primarily of direct originations of (i) first lien senior secured debt and unitranche debt (including last out portions of such loans) and, to a lesser extent, (ii) second lien senior secured debt and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt. In connection with its debt investments, the Company is permitted to receive equity warrants or make select equity co-investments. We generally consider middle market companies to consist of companies with between 25 million and 100 million of annual EBITDA, although the Company may from time to time invest in larger or smaller companies. Although we invest primarily in middle market companies domiciled in the United States, we also may from time to time invest, to a lesser extent, in companies domiciled outside of the United States (subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70 of our assets in United States companies). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average yield on the principal amount of our outstanding debt investments was approximately 10.9 and 12.5 , respectively.

Our Adviser monitors on an ongoing basis, the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: (i) assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account in certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows: 

Grade 1 investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit; 

Grade 2 investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2; 

Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not significantly past due; and 

Grade 4 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. Our Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least each quarter and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments with a grade of 3 or 4, the Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The following table shows the composition of our portfolio (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) on the 1 to 4 grading scale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (amounts in thousands).

Non-Accrual Assets Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 we had no non-accrual assets.

Professional Fees Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 0.2 million and 1.4 million in professional fees, respectively. Administrative Service Expenses Administrative service expenses represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and other non-investment professionals that perform duties for us. See Note 3. Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Administration Agreement and the administrative fees thereunder. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 0.3 million and 1.3 million of administrative service expenses, respectively. Interest and Other Debt Expenses Interest and other financing fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were attributable to borrowings under the JPM Facility (as discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources ). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 4.8 million and 6.8 million in interest and other debt expenses, respectively. Offering Costs Costs associated with the offering of common shares of the Company are capitalized as deferred offering costs and included on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and amortized over a twelve-month period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 0.4 million and 1.2 million in offering costs, respectively. Other General and Administrative Expenses Other general and administrative expenses include director fees, insurance, filing, research, our sub-administrator, subscriptions and other costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 0.3 million and 1.1 million in other general and administrative expenses, respectively. Compensation of the Adviser We pay the Adviser an investment advisory fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a Management Fee and an Incentive Fee. The cost of both the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee is ultimately borne by the Stockholders. Management Fee The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The Management Fee is payable at an annual rate of 0.75 (1.00 in the event of an Exchange Listing) of the average value of our gross assets at the end of each of our two most recently completed calendar quarters. For purposes of calculating the Management Fee, gross assets means the total assets of the Company determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. The Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases of our Common Stock during the relevant calendar quarter. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, our first quarter-end following the commencement of operations, the Management Fee was calculated based on the value of our gross assets as of such quarter-end. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Investment Advisory Agreement and the fee arrangement thereunder. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred Management Fees of 0.7 million and 1.2 million, respectively. Incentive Fees We pay to the Adviser an Incentive Fee that consists of two parts. The Investment Income Incentive Fee is calculated and payable on a quarterly basis, in arrears, and equals 10 (17.5 in the event of an Exchange Listing) of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a quarterly preferred return of 1.5 (i.e., 6.0 annualized), or Hurdle, measured on a quarterly basis and a catch-up feature. 
 32 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash and any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter minus the Company s operating expenses accrued during the calendar quarter (including the Management Fee, administrative expenses and any interest expense and dividends paid on issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the beginning of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a Hurdle Amount equal to the product of (i) the Hurdle rate of 1.50 per quarter (6.0 annualized) and (ii) our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any Incentive Fees payable during the period) at the beginning of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is an annual fee that is determined and payable, in arrears, as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement) in an amount equal to 10 (17.5 following an Exchange Listing) of realized capital gains, if any, determined on a cumulative basis from the commencement of the Company s investment operations (based on the fair market value of each investment as of such date) through the end of such calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement), computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from the commencement of the Company s investment operations (based on the fair market value of each investment as of such date) through the end of such calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Incentive Fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred Incentive Fees of 0.5 million. Net Unrealized Appreciation Net unrealized appreciation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was as follows (amounts in thousands):

Net unrealized appreciation / (depreciation) on investments 

22 

(176) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of 0.02 million. The net unrealized appreciation on the Company s current portfolio was driven by fundamental portfolio performance of investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net unrealized depreciation on our current portfolio of 0.2 million. The net unrealized depreciation on the Company s current portfolio was a result of the fair value of the majority of the portfolio assets being equal to their original cost, given the recency of origination and stable portfolio performance since origination. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our current cash on hand, our short-term investments, our available borrowing capacity under the JPM Facility, unfunded investor Capital Commitments and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations for at least the next twelve months. Under the 1940 Act, we are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio which the value of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) bears to the aggregate amount of our outstanding senior securities representing our indebtedness, of at least 150 after each issuance of senior securities. Our asset coverage ratio was 175.7 as of September 30, 2024. Cash Flows For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net decrease in cash in the amount of 15.3 million. During that period, our operating activities used 428.3 million in cash, consisting primarily of purchases of portfolio investments of 441.0 million. In addition, financing activities provided net cash of 413.0 million, consisting primarily of net borrowings under the JPM Facility of 257.4 million and proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock of 162.1 million. At September 30, 2024, we had 52.4 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 33 

Financing Transactions JPM Facility On October 18, 2023 the Company entered into, through the Financing SPV, a Loan and Security Agreement by and among the Company, the Financing SPV, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as lender and administrative agent for the lender parties providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility to the Financing SPV of 200 million (the JPM Facility ). The JPM Facility size is increasable to up to 800 million subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including availability under the borrowing base, which is based on a combination of unfunded Capital Commitments and other loan collateral including the Financing SPV s portfolio investments. Our Adviser serves as the portfolio manager (in such capacity, the Facility Portfolio Manager under the JPM Facility. U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association serves as collateral agent and U.S. Bank National Association serves as securities intermediary. Proceeds from borrowings under the JPM Facility are expected to be used to facilitate investments and for the timely payment of the Financing SPV s expenses, and to make certain permitted distributions to the Company. The JPM Facility is a revolving credit facility with a revolving period ending October 18, 2026 (or upon the occurrence of certain events as specified therein) and has a scheduled maturity date of October 18, 2028. Advances under the JPM Facility are available in U.S. dollars and other permitted currencies. As of September 30, 2024, the interest charged on the JPM Facility was based on SOFR, SONIA, SARON, EURIBOR or CORRA, as applicable (or, if SOFR is not available, a benchmark replacement or a base rate (which is the greater of the prime rate and the federal funds rate plus 0.50 ), as applicable), plus a margin of (1) 2.65 prior to the earlier of (x) the first day on which the Company has drawn more than one-third of its Capital Commitments and (y) April 18, 2025 and (2) 2.75 thereafter. Under the JPM Facility, the Financing SPV will pay an undrawn fee of (i) during the first nine months of the JPM Facility, 0.50 per annum and (ii) thereafter, 0.75 per annum, in each case, on the average daily unused amount of the financing commitments until the end of the revolving period, subject to minimum utilization requirements. The obligations of the Financing SPV to the lenders under the JPM Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in the unfunded Capital Commitments to the Company and the related proceeds and all of the Financing SPV s portfolio investments and other assets. In connection with the JPM Facility, the Financing SPV has made certain customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar facilities. The JPM Facility contains customary events of default for similar financing transactions, including if a change of control of the Financing SPV occurs. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, the lenders under the JPM Facility may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the JPM Facility immediately due and payable. The occurrence of an event of default (as described above) triggers a requirement that the Financing SPV obtain the consent of the lenders under the applicable JPM Facility prior to entering into any sale or disposition with respect to portfolio investments. As of September 30, 2024, to the Company s knowledge, each of the Company, the Financing SPV and the Facility Portfolio Manager was in compliance with all covenants and other requirements applicable to it under the JPM Facility. As of September 30, 2024, total commitments under the JPM Facility were 400 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had U.S. dollar borrowings of 309.7 million outstanding under the JPM Facility with a weighted average interest rate of 7.77 . Distributions to Stockholders We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for our tax year ended December 31, 2023, and intend to make the required distributions to our Stockholders as specified therein and qualify annually as a RIC. In order to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC and to obtain RIC tax benefits, we must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then we are generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income and gains we do not distribute (actually or constructively) and certain built-in gains. We monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the Code. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any level of cash distributions and our ability to make distributions will be limited by the asset coverage requirement and related provisions under the 1940 Act and contained in any applicable indenture and related supplements. In addition, in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we may declare a significant portion of our dividends in shares of our Common Stock instead of in cash. A Stockholder generally would be subject to tax on 100 of the fair market value of the dividend on the date the dividend is received by the Stockholder in the same manner as a cash dividend, even though a portion of the dividend was paid in shares of our Common Stock. 
 34 

The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require us to distribute to our Stockholders each year at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, or ICTI, as defined by the Code. Depending on the level of ICTI and net capital gain, if any, earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such excess. Any such carryover income must be distributed before the end of the next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such income. ICTI generally differs from net investment income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses. We may be required to recognize ICTI in certain circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments issued with warrants), we must include in ICTI each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in ICTI other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as (i) PIK interest income and (ii) interest income from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. Because any OID or other amounts accrued will be included in our ICTI for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our Stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements, even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. ICTI also excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. See Recent Developments below, as well as Note 12 Subsequent Events to our Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding a subsequent event relating to distributions declared to our Stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. Investments at Fair Value One of the critical accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below: Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Transfers between levels, if any, will be recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Adviser will apply a valuation policy approved by the Board of Directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, the Adviser will evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), the Adviser will subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, the Adviser, or the independent valuation firm(s), will review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 35 

In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. In connection with a drawdown, the Board of Directors or a committee thereof will be required to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our Common Stock at a price below the then current net asset value of our Common Stock, exclusive of any distributing commission or discount (which net asset value shall be determined as of a time within 48 hours, excluding Sunday and holidays, next preceding the time of such determination). Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records will be maintained with other records that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. Investment Valuation Process The determination of the fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. As part of the valuation process, the Adviser will take into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Adviser will consider whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. The Adviser will undertake a multi-step valuation process, which is expected to include, among other procedures, the following: 

With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the bid price of those market quotations; 

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process will begin with either (i) independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of such investment to the Adviser s valuation committee or (ii) the Adviser preparing a preliminary valuation of such investment based on proprietary models; and 

Preliminary valuation conclusions will be documented and discussed within the Adviser s valuation committee. Revenue Recognition Interest and Dividend Income Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts, amortization of premiums and PIK interest. Discounts from and premiums to par value on investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. To the extent loans contain PIK provisions, PIK interest, computed at the contractual rates, is accrued and recorded as interest income and added to the principal balance of the loan. PIK interest income added to the principal balance is generally collected upon repayment of the outstanding principal. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when interest and/or principal payments become materially past due and there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Recognition of interest income of that loan will be ceased until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. However, we remain contractually entitled to this interest. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon our judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid or there is no longer any reasonable doubt that such principal or interest will be collected in full and, in our judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value or is in the process of collection. Accrued interest is written-off when it becomes probable that the interest will not be collected, and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. Dividend income on preferred equity is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. To the extent preferred equity contains PIK provisions, PIK dividends computed at the contractual rates are accrued and recorded as dividend income and added to the principal balance of the preferred equity. PIK dividends added to the principal balance are generally collected upon redemption of the equity. 
 36 

Other Income Dividends earned on money market balances are recorded on an accrual basis. Such income is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Investment Transactions Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. Other income may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, unused, and prepayment fees associated with our investment activities, as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by the Company to its portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. Income Taxes We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for our tax year ended December 31, 2023, and intend to qualify annually as a RIC. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we fail to distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98 of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (iii) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax (collectively, the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements ), we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on the amount by which we do not meet the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year-end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). 
 37 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The balance of unfunded commitments to extend financing as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows (amounts in thousands):

Recent Developments On November 6, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.63 per share payable on December 13, 2024, to Stockholders of record as of November 6, 2024. On November 7, 2024, the Company issued and sold approximately 1,068,824 shares of the Company s Common Stock, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 26,645,000. The sale of Common Stock was made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into by the Company and its investors. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of Common Stock up to the amount of their respective capital commitments on an as-needed basis with a minimum of ten calendar days prior notice to investors. The issuance of the Common Stock is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof and Regulation D or Regulation S thereunder, as applicable. The Company relied upon representations from the investors in the subscription agreements that each investor was, as applicable, either (a) an accredited investor as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act or (b) not a U.S. person as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act. 

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to certain financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate fluctuations. Valuation Risk We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. These investments will generally not have a readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as the Board of Directors valuation designee, in accordance with our valuation policy and procedures established by our Board of Directors. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Account Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on estimates and judgments made by us in connection with the valuation of our investments. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Because we have borrowed, and may from time to time borrow, money to make investments, our net investment income will depend in part upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds as well as our level of leverage. The interest charged on the JPM Facility is a floating rate based on SOFR, SONIA, SARON, EURIBOR or CDOR, as applicable (or, if SOFR is not available, a benchmark replacement or a base rate ). As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income or net assets. We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate-sensitive assets to our interest rate-sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 100.0 of investments at fair value (excluding unfunded debt investments) represent floating-rate investments with a SOFR floor (includes investments bearing prime interest rate contracts) and none of our investments at fair value represent fixed-rate investments. Additionally, our senior secured revolving credit facilities are also subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating SOFR rates and prime interest rates. The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income and expenses, should interest rates increase or decrease by 50, 100, 150 or 200 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our outstanding revolving 
 39 

credit facilities. For our floating rate credit facilities, we use the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. Interest expense on our floating rate credit facilities is calculated using the interest rate as of September 30, 2024, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. The base interest rate case assumes the rates on our portfolio investments remain unchanged from the actual effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table (amounts in thousands).

 Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of assets in our portfolio and other business developments that could affect our net income. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. We may hedge against interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or a credit facility subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currencies, such activities may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to the portion of our portfolio of investments, if any, with fixed interest rates or denominated in foreign currencies. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Part II. 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings threatened against us. We may be a party to certain lawsuits in the normal course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with our activities or the activities of our portfolio companies. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 40 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS Investments in the Company involve a high degree of risk. There can be no assurance that our investment objective will be achieved. We believe that there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously reported under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

ITEM 2. 
 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Except as previously reported by the Company on its current reports on Form 8-K, the Company did not sell any securities during the period covered by this Report that were not registered under the Securities Act. The Company did not conduct any repurchases of its shares of Common Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 3. 
 DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. 

ITEM 4. 
 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable.

ITEM 5.
