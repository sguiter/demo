 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects a statutory tax rate on the Company s Singapore operations, a corporate income tax rate on its domestic operations, and a tax rate on its Macao gaming operations due to the Company s income tax exemption in Macao. 
 On February 5, 2024, the Macao government provided notice that VML and its peers received an exemption from Macao s corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for the period from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2027.

 Nassau Coliseum 
 In conjunction with the Nassau Coliseum Transaction, the seller assigned their lease of the land on which the related assets, including the Nassau Coliseum and other improvements, are affixed (the Original Lease to the Company. Immediately following this assignment, the Company entered into a new land lease agreement with the County, for the use and exclusive right to develop and operate assets on the land (the New Lease ), which commenced on June 2, 2023. 
 On April 18, 2023, Hofstra University Hofstra filed a petition against the Nassau County Planning Commission (the Planning Commission in the New York Supreme Court, County of Nassau, asserting, among other things, that certain meetings held by the Planning Commission concerning the New Lease and certain related transactions were not properly noticed and/or held, and that appropriate materials concerning the meetings were not made available to the public by the Planning Commission in connection with the meetings. On May 31, 2023, Hofstra filed an amended petition that, among other things, added additional respondents and sought to invalidate certain votes held by the County and the Nassau County Legislature. The Company is not a party to these proceedings. 
 In a decision and order dated November 9, 2023, the New York Supreme Court annulled various votes held by the Nassau County Legislature, annulled the New Lease and remitted the matter to the Planning Commission and the Nassau County Legislature to conduct a proper public hearing in accordance with all relevant statutes and rules, including the Nassau County Administrative Code and the Open Meetings law and for the issuance of a positive declaration pursuant to the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act and for the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. On November 10, 2023, the respondents appealed the decision and order and on November 21, 2023, Hofstra cross-appealed. On December 13, 2023, the Appellate Division: Second Judicial Department denied respondents motion to stay enforcement of the decision and order pending the appeal, but granted a calendar preference, indicating that the appeal will be calendared expeditiously after all briefs have been filed.

 million. On January 29, 2024, Hofstra filed a motion seeking a declaration that the Court s prior order included the annulment of Nassau County s consent and the putative assignment to the Company of the Original Lease. 
 On February 23, 2024, the New York State Supreme Court ruled the Original Lease had been terminated and the Company currently had no leasehold interest in the land upon which the Nassau Coliseum sits. On February 27, 2024, the respondents appealed the decision, order and interlocutory judgment. On March 29, 2024, the Appellate Division: Second Judicial Department denied respondents motion to stay enforcement of the decision, order and interlocutory judgment. Subsequent to this order, the Company entered into a use and occupancy permit (the Permit with the County to allow the Company to continue operating the Nassau Coliseum for a nominal fee. The Company considered the accounting guidance under ASC 842 and determined the Permit meets the definition of a lease as it conveys the right to control the use of the associated assets for a specified period of time. Consequently, the Original Lease was deemed to be modified, maintaining the operating lease classification. 
 On August 16, 2024, the Company entered into a lease agreement with the County for the use and exclusive right to operate assets on approximately 72 acres of land, including the Nassau Coliseum and other improvements thereon (the Updated Lease ), which has a 42-year lease term (inclusive of three 5-year extensions). The Company is required to make annual rent payments in the amounts and at the times specified in the Updated Lease. As of September 30, 2024, the related right-of-use ROU asset and finance lease liability were million and million, respectively. 
 In the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet, the Updated Lease ROU asset is included in Property and equipment, net and the noncurrent portion of the related finance lease liability is included in Long-term debt. 
 The future minimum lease payments are million for the three-month period ending December 31, 2024, and for each of the years ending December 31, 2025 and 2026, million for the year ending December 31, 2027, million for the year ending December 31, 2028, and million thereafter.

 billion patacas (approximately million at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024), which alleges a breach of agreements entered into between AAEC and LVS (Nevada), LVSLLC and VCR (collectively, the U.S. Defendants for their joint presentation of a bid in response to the public tender held by the Macao government for the award of gaming concessions at the end of 2001. 
 On March 24, 2014, the Macao First Instance Court issued a decision holding that AAEC s claim against VML is unfounded and that VML be removed as a party to the proceedings. On May 8, 2014, AAEC lodged an appeal against that decision. 
 On June 5, 2015, the U.S. Defendants applied to the Macao First Instance Court to dismiss the claims against them as res judicata based on the dismissal of prior action in the United States that had alleged similar claims. On March 16, 2016, the Macao First Instance Court dismissed the defense of res judicata. An appeal against that decision was lodged by U.S. Defendants on April 7, 2016. At the end of December 2016, all the appeals were transferred to the Macao Second Instance Court. 
 Evidence gathering by the Macao First Instance Court commenced by letters rogatory, which was completed on March 14, 2019. 
 On July 15, 2019, AAEC submitted a request to the Macao First Instance Court to increase the amount of its claim to billion patacas (approximately billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024), allegedly representing lost profits from 2004 to 2018, and reserving its right to claim for lost profits up to 2022. On September 4, 2019, the Macao First Instance Court allowed AAEC s amended request. The U.S. Defendants appealed the decision allowing the amended claim on September 17, 2019; the Macao First Instance Court accepted the appeal on September 26, 2019. 
 On April 16, 2021, the U.S. Defendants moved to reschedule the trial because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Macao First Instance Court denied the U.S. Defendants motion on May 28, 2021. The U.S. Defendants appealed that ruling on June 16, 2021. 
 The trial began on June 16, 2021. By order dated June 17, 2021, the Macao First Instance Court scheduled additional trial dates in late 2021 to hear witnesses who were subject to COVID-19 travel restrictions that prevented or severely limited their ability to enter Macao. The U.S. Defendants appealed certain aspects of the Macao First Instance Court s June 17, 2021 order. 
 On July 10, 2021, the U.S. Defendants were notified of an invoice for supplemental court fees totaling million patacas (approximately million at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024) based on Plaintiff s July 15, 2019 amendment. By motion dated July 20, 2021, the U.S. Defendants moved for an order withdrawing that invoice. The Macao First Instance Court denied that motion by order dated September 11, 2021. The U.S. Defendants appealed that order on September 23, 2021. By order dated September 29, 2021, the Macao First Instance Court ordered that the invoice for supplemental court fees be stayed pending resolution of that appeal. 
 From December 17, 2021 to January 19, 2022, Plaintiff submitted additional documents to the court file and disclosed written reports from two purported experts, who calculated Plaintiff s damages at billion patacas and billion patacas (approximately billion and billion, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024). On April 28, 2022, the Macao First Instance Court entered a judgment for the U.S. Defendants. The Macao First Instance Court also held that Plaintiff litigated certain aspects of its case in bad faith.

 million patacas (approximately million at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024). By motion dated September 29, 2022, the U.S. Defendants moved the Macao First Instance Court for an order withdrawing that invoice. The Macao First Instance Court denied that motion by order dated October 24, 2022. The U.S. Defendants appealed that order on November 10, 2022 and on January 6, 2023, submitted the appeal brief. 
 On October 9, 2023, the U.S. Defendants were notified that the Macao Second Instance Court had invited Plaintiff to amend its appeal brief, primarily to separate out matters of fact from matters of law, and Plaintiff had submitted an amended appeal brief on October 5, 2023. The U.S. Defendants responded to Plaintiff s amended appeal brief on October 30, 2023. On November 8, 2023, the Macao Second Instance Court issued an order concluding that Plaintiff may have litigated in bad faith by exceeding the scope of permissible amendments to its appeal brief and invited responses from the parties. Plaintiff moved for clarification of the November 8 order on November 22, 2023, and the U.S. Defendants responded to the November 8 order on November 23, 2023. On January 5, 2024, the Macao Second Instance Court rejected Plaintiff s request for clarification. This matter is currently pending the Macao Second Instance Court s decision. 
 On October 17, 2024, the Macao Second Instance Court rejected Plaintiff's appeal on procedural grounds and found it unnecessary to hear the interlocutory appeals lodged by Plaintiff and by U.S. Defendants. The Macao Second Instance Court further decided that Plaintiff had litigated in bad faith. Plaintiff was notified of these decisions on October 21, 2024, and has until November 5, 2024 to file a notice of appeal from the Macao Second Instance Court s decisions. The U.S. Defendants are currently evaluating the Macao Second Instance Court s decision. 
 Management has determined that, based on proceedings to date, it is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously. 
 The Daniels Family 2001 Revocable Trust v. LVSC, et al. 
 On October 22, 2020, The Daniels Family 2001 Revocable Trust, a putative purchaser of the Company s shares, filed a purported class action complaint in the U.S. District Court against LVSC, Sheldon G. Adelson and Patrick Dumont. The complaint asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act and alleges that LVSC made materially false or misleading statements, or failed to disclose material facts, from February 27, 2016 through September 15, 2020, with respect to its operations at Marina Bay Sands, its compliance with Singapore laws and regulations, and its disclosure controls and procedures. 
 On January 5, 2021, the U.S. District Court entered an order appointing Carl S. Ciaccio and Donald M. DeSalvo as lead plaintiffs Lead Plaintiffs ). On March 8, 2021, Lead Plaintiffs filed a purported class action amended complaint against LVSC, Sheldon G. Adelson, Patrick Dumont, and Robert G. Goldstein, alleging similar violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act over the same time period of February 27, 2016 through September 15, 2020. On March 22, 2021, the U.S. District Court granted Lead Plaintiffs motion to substitute Dr. Miriam Adelson, in her capacity as the Special Administrator for the estate of Sheldon G. Adelson, for Sheldon G. Adelson as a defendant in this action. 
 On May 7, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which on March 28, 2022, the U.S. District Court granted in its entirety. The U.S. District Court dismissed certain claims with prejudice, but granted Lead Plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint with respect to the other claims by April 18, 2022. On April 8, 2022, Lead Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration and to extend time to file an Amended Complaint. The defendants filed an opposition to the motion on April 22, 2022. 
 On April 18, 2022, Lead Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. On May 18, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, and briefing was completed on July 8, 2022. 
 On August 8, 2023, the U.S. District Court denied Lead Plaintiffs motion for reconsideration, and granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. The U.S. District Court dismissed Lead Plaintiffs allegations pertaining to the challenged statements that were made in 2016, 2017 and 2018, but allowed the allegations pertaining to the challenged statements from 2019 and 2020 to proceed. On August 22, 2023, the defendants filed a motion for partial reconsideration, requesting that the U.S. District Court reconsider its denial of the motion to dismiss with respect to the challenged statements from 2019 and 2020. If the motion for partial reconsideration is granted, this would result in dismissal of the second amended complaint. The defendants also moved, in the event the motion for partial

 ____________________ 
 (1) Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal or impairment of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance. In particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to compare the operating profitability of its operations with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically reported adjusted property EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP financial measures. In order to view the operations of their properties on a more stand-alone basis, Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property EBITDA calculations. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal repayments and income taxes, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property EBITDA. Not all companies calculate adjusted property EBITDA in the same manner. As a result, consolidated adjusted property EBITDA as presented by the Company may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 (2) During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of million and million, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, was included in corporate expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Certain statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Operations 
 We view each of our Integrated Resort properties as an operating segment. Our operating segments in Macao consist of The Venetian Macao; The Londoner Macao; The Parisian Macao; The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao; and the Sands Macao. Our operating segment in Singapore is Marina Bay Sands. 
 Macao 
 From 2020 through the beginning of 2023, our operations in Macao were negatively impacted by the reduction in travel and tourism related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Macao government s policy regarding the management of COVID-19 and general travel restrictions was relaxed in late December 2022 and early January 2023. Since then, visitation to our Macao Integrated Resorts and operations has improved. 
 The Macao government announced total visitation from mainland China to Macao increased approximately 36.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The Macao government also announced gross gaming revenue increased approximately 31.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Singapore 
 Our operations in Singapore continued to be positive as travel and tourism spending increased, resulting from the elimination of all remaining COVID-19 border measures in February 2023. Airlift passenger movement has increased with a total of 44 million passengers having passed through Singapore s Changi Airport from January to August 2024 (the latest statistics currently available), an increase of 17 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Visitation to Marina Bay Sands continues to improve since the travel restrictions have been lifted. The Singapore Tourism Board STB announced total visitation to Singapore increased to approximately 12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 10.1 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Summary 
 We have a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity in place, including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 4.21 billion as of September 30, 2024 and access to 1.50 billion, 2.51 billion and 460 million of available borrowing capacity from our 2024 LVSC Revolving Facility, 2024 SCL Revolving Facility (which replaced the 2018 SCL Revolving Facility as of October 23, 2024) and 2012 Singapore Revolving Facility, respectively. We believe we are able to support our continuing operations and complete the major construction projects that are underway. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 For a discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates, please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations presented in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 7, 2024. 
 There were no newly identified significant accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, nor were there any material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our 2023 Annual Report.

 Operating Results 
 Key Operating Revenue Measurements 
 Operating revenues at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao and Marina Bay Sands are dependent upon the volume of patrons who stay at the hotel, which affects the price charged for hotel rooms and our gaming volume. Operating revenues at Sands Macao are principally driven by the volume of gaming patrons who visit the property on a daily basis. 
 Management utilizes the following volume and pricing measures in order to evaluate past performance and assist in forecasting future revenues. The various volume measurements indicate our ability to attract patrons to our Integrated Resorts. In casino operations, win and hold percentages indicate the amount of revenue to be expected based on volume. In hotel operations, average daily rate and revenue per available room indicate the demand for rooms and our ability to capture that demand. In mall operations, base rent per square foot indicates our ability to attract and maintain profitable tenants for our leasable space. 
 The following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenues: 
 Casino revenue measurements for Macao and Singapore: Macao and Singapore table games are segregated into two groups: Rolling Chip play (composed of VIP players) and Non-Rolling Chip play (mostly non-VIP players). The volume measurement for Rolling Chip play is non-negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost. The volume measurement for Non-Rolling Chip play is table games drop drop ), which is net markers issued (credit instruments), cash deposited in the table drop boxes and gaming chips purchased and exchanged at the cage. Rolling Chip and Non-Rolling Chip volume measurements are not comparable as they are two distinct measures of volume. The amounts wagered and lost for Rolling Chip play are substantially higher than the amounts dropped for Non-Rolling Chip play. Slot handle, also a volume measurement, is the gross amount wagered for the period cited. 
 We view Rolling Chip win as a percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip win as a percentage of drop and slot hold (amount won by the casino) as a percentage of slot handle. Win or hold percentage represents the percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue. Our win and hold percentages are calculated before discounts, commissions, deferring revenue associated with our loyalty programs and allocating casino revenues related to goods and services provided to patrons on a complimentary basis. Our Rolling Chip table games are expected to produce a win percentage of 3.30 in Macao and Singapore, and our Non-Rolling Chip table games have produced a trailing 12-month win percentage of 24.9 , 21.4 , 20.8 , 23.6 , 16.7 and 19.5 at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, Sands Macao and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. Our slot machines have produced a trailing 12-month hold percentage of 3.8 , 3.9 , 4.1 , 4.4 , 2.9 and 3.8 at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, Sands Macao and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. Actual win and hold percentages may vary from our expected win percentage and the trailing 12-month win and hold percentages. Generally, slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis. In Macao and Singapore, 9.8 and 11.7 , respectively, of our table games play was conducted on a credit basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Hotel revenue measurements: Performance indicators used are occupancy rate (a volume indicator), which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period and average daily room rate ADR, a price indicator), which is the average price of occupied rooms per day. Available rooms exclude those rooms unavailable for occupancy during the period due to renovation, development or other requirements (such as government mandated closure, lodging for team members and usage by the Macao government for quarantine measures). The calculations of the occupancy rate and ADR include the impact of rooms provided on a complimentary basis. Revenue per available room RevPAR represents a summary of hotel ADR and occupancy. Because not all available rooms are occupied, ADR is normally higher than RevPAR. Reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit, or where guests check out early, may be re-sold to walk-in guests. 
 Mall revenue measurements: Occupancy, base rent per square foot and tenant sales per square foot are used as performance indicators. Occupancy represents gross leasable occupied area GLOA divided by gross leasable area GLA at the end of the reporting period. GLOA is the sum of: (1) tenant occupied space under lease and (2) tenants no longer occupying space, but paying rent. GLA does not include space currently under development or not on the market for lease. Base rent per square foot is the weighted average base or minimum rent charge in effect at the end of the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in occupancy. Tenant sales per square foot is the sum of reported comparable sales for the trailing 12 months divided by the comparable square footage for the same period. Only tenants that have been open for a minimum of 12 months are included in the tenant sales per square foot calculation.

 Consolidated net revenues were 2.68 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 113 million compared to 2.80 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to decreases of 94 million and 19 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively. 
 Net casino revenues decreased 72 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a 98 million decrease at Marina Bay Sands, partially offset by a 26 million increase at our Macao operations. Casino revenues at Marina Bay Sands decreased due to decreased Rolling Chip volume and win percentage, partially offset by increased Non-Rolling Chip volume and win percentage. Our Macao operations increased due to increased slot volumes and Non-Rolling Chip win percentage, partially offset by decreased Rolling Chip win and slot hold percentages.

 Room revenues decreased 28 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to our Macao operations driven by a decrease in available rooms in connection with the conversion of the Sheraton towers to the Londoner Grand. Revenues at Marina Bay Sands remained flat due to an increase in ADR, offset by a decrease in occupied room nights driven by room renovations.

 Mall revenues decreased 12 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 7 million in our Macao operations was primarily driven by a 14 million decrease in overage rent, partially offset by a 6 million increase in base rent. The 5 million decrease at Marina Bay Sands was driven by an 8 million decrease in overage rent, partially offset by a 4 million increase in base rent. For further information related to the financial performance of our malls, see Additional Information Regarding our Retail Mall Operations.

 Convention, retail and other revenues increased 3 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a 9 million increase at Marina Bay Sands, partially offset by a 6 million decrease at our Macao operations. The increase at Marina Bay Sands was driven by increases of 5 million in convention revenue and 4 million in other revenues (e.g., Sky Park, spa). The decrease at our Macao operations was primarily due to a 12 million insurance recovery due to Typhoon Saola in September 2023, partially offset by increases of 3 million in entertainment, 2 million in ferry operations and 1 million in other revenues (e.g., limo, exhibits).

 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consisted of the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Percent Change (Dollars in millions) Casino 1,120 1,103 1.5 Rooms 79 80 (1.3) Food and beverage 129 128 0.8 Mall 23 23 Convention, retail and other 62 52 19.2 Provision for (recovery of) credit losses (5) 3 (266.7) General and administrative 293 290 1.0 Corporate 68 49 38.8 Pre-opening 4 3 33.3 Development 55 44 25.0 Depreciation and amortization 324 313 3.5 Amortization of leasehold interests in land 15 15 Loss on disposal or impairment of assets 11 4 175.0 Total operating expenses 2,178 2,107 3.4 
 Operating expenses were 2.18 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 71 million compared to 2.11 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases of 19 million in corporate expenses, 17 million in casino expenses, 11 million in development expenses and 11 million in depreciation and amortization expense. 
 Casino expenses increased 17 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 21 million increase in gaming taxes at our Macao operations due to increased gross gaming revenues, partially offset by an 11 million decrease in gaming taxes at Marina Bay Sands due to decreased casino revenues. The decrease in gaming taxes at Marina Bay Sands was partially offset by a 1 increase in goods and service tax GST in Singapore as of January 1, 2024. 
 Convention, retail and other expenses increased 10 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 9 million increase at our Macao operations. The increase was due to increases of 3 million in entertainment due to more special events, 2 million in ferry operations due to increased expenses for gas and oil and repairs and maintenance, and 4 million in other operating expenses (e.g., limos, exhibits). 
 Recovery of credit losses was 5 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to provision for credit losses of 3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 8 million decrease was due to Marina Bay Sands, resulting from a 14 million increase in collections on previously reserved accounts, partially offset by a 6 million increase in the provision for the current quarter. The provision for credit losses at our Macao operations remained flat due to 4 million in collections on previously reserved accounts, offset by a 4 million decrease in provision for the current quarter. The amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the patrons who owe us money from gaming activities. We believe the amount of our provision for credit losses in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit. 
 Corporate expense increased 19 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 9 million increase in payroll, 3 million related to a shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government and a 4 million decrease in legal fee recoveries. 
 Development expenses were 55 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 44 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was primarily due to increased efforts related to our digital gaming pursuits. Development costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 11 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 40 million increase at Marina Bay Sands as a result of the completion of renovations that were placed into service throughout 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024. This increase was partially offset by a 31 million decrease at our Macao operations due to a decrease in accelerated depreciation related to the conversion of the

 Sheraton towers to the Londoner Grand in connection with Phase II of The Londoner Macao and a decrease due to assets fully depreciated during the prior year and through the third quarter of the current year, partially offset by an increase in depreciation due to assets placed into service after September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on disposal or impairment of assets was 11 million for three months ended September 30, 2024. The losses incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily due to an 8 million loss in Macao, including demolition costs primarily related to Phase II of The Londoner Macao and the write-off of design costs, and a 2 million loss at Marina Bay Sands from demolition costs related to room renovations. 
 Segment Adjusted Property EBITDA 
 The following table summarizes information related to our segments:

 991 1,122 (11.7) 
 __________________________ 
 (1) Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by management as the primary measure of the operating performance of our segments. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is net income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal or impairment of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance. In particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to compare the operating profitability of our operations with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically reported adjusted property EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP financial measures. In order to view the operations of their properties on a more stand-alone basis, Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property EBITDA calculations. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We have significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal repayments and income taxes, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property EBITDA. Not all companies calculate adjusted property EBITDA in the same manner. As a result, our presentation of consolidated adjusted property EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

 Adjusted property EBITDA at our Macao operations decreased 46 million compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to decreases across room, mall, food and beverage and other non-gaming operations at our Integrated Resorts in Macao. 
 Adjusted property EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands decreased 85 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in casino operations.

 13,865 14,863 Weighted average interest rate 
 5.1 5.4 
 Interest cost decreased 19 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in the weighted average interest rate from 5.4 to 5.1 and the weighted average total debt balance from 14.86 billion to 13.87 billion. The weighted average interest rate decreased primarily due to lower interest rates on the SCL senior notes in connection with the credit rating upgrades for the Company and Sands China Ltd. SCL to BBB- by S P on July 26, 2023 and Fitch on February 1, 2024, and the decrease in interest rates on our Singapore Credit Facility. These items were partially offset by higher interest rates associated with the issuance of the LVSC Senior Notes on May 16, 2024 to accomplish the repayment of the 2024 LVSC Senior Notes on June 26, 2024. The weighted average total debt balance decreased primarily due to the repayment of 1.95 billion on the SCL Revolving Facility by October 2023 and repurchases totaling 175 million of the 2025 SCL Senior Notes throughout the three months ended June 30, 2024.

 Other Factors Affecting Earnings 
 Interest income was 67 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 79 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in cash available to invest in the U.S. due to share repurchases, dividends and development-related spend in the last twelve months. This decrease was partially offset by increased paid-in-kind interest rate under the seller financing loan agreement entered into in connection with the sale of our Las Vegas real property and operations and an increase in cash available to invest in Macao. 
 Other income was 11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to 10 million of foreign currency transaction gains driven by U.S. dollar denominated debt held by SCL. 
 Our income tax expense was 50 million on income before income taxes of 403 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a 12.4 effective income tax rate. This compares to a 21.4 effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflects a 17 statutory tax rate on our Singapore operations, a 21 corporate income tax on our domestic operations and a zero percent rate on our Macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in Macao. 
 On February 5, 2024, the Macao government provided notice that Venetian Macau Limited VML, a subsidiary of SCL) and its peers received an income tax exemption on gaming operations for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2027. Additionally, we entered into a shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government in February 2024, effective January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025, providing an annual payment as a substitution for a 12 tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense included an anticipated 38 million shareholder dividend tax based on the information available at the balance sheet date. 
 The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 78 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 69 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts were related to the noncontrolling interest of SCL.

 Net casino revenues increased 788 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by increases of 563 million and 225 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. Casino revenue at our Macao operations increased due to increased table games and slot volumes, partially offset by decreased Rolling Chip win and slot hold percentages. Casino revenues at Marina Bay Sands increased due to increased Non-Rolling Chip drop and Non-Rolling Chip and Rolling Chip win percentages, partially offset by decreased Rolling Chip volume.

 Room revenues increased 76 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to increases of 49 million and 27 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively. Marina Bay Sands room revenues increased due to an increase in ADR, partially offset by a decrease in available rooms and decreased occupancy. Macao room revenues increased due to an increase in occupancy rates, partially offset by decreases in available rooms in connection with the conversion of the Sheraton towers to the Londoner Grand and ADR due to increased hotel inventory across the Macao market. 
 The following table summarizes the results of our room activity:

 (2) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 1,850 and 2,000 rooms, respectively, were available for occupancy. 
 Food and beverage revenues increased 27 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by increased business volume at food and beverage outlets and banquet operations at our Macao operations.

 Mall revenues increased 2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. While Macao operations remained stable, the 2 million increase related to Marina Bay Sands was driven by a 13 million increase in base rent, partially offset by an 11 million decrease in overage rent and revenues related to CAM and other reimbursements.

 Convention, retail and other revenues increased 52 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to increases of 32 million and 20 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively. The increase at Marina Bay Sands was due to increases of 13 million in convention revenue, 3 million in entertainment revenue and 8 million in other operating revenues (e.g., limo, Sky Park, spa), as well as an 8 million nonrecurring adjustment related to a change in accounting estimate of our non-gaming club points accrual. The increase at our Macao operations was driven by increases of 12 million in ferry operations due to increased sailings resulting from increased visitation and 10 million in entertainment revenue, partially offset by a decrease of 2 million in other revenues (e.g., limo, exhibits). 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consisted of the following: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Percent Change (Dollars in millions) Casino 3,441 3,011 14.3 Rooms 234 207 13.0 Food and beverage 379 349 8.6 Mall 62 65 (4.6) Convention, retail and other 177 141 25.5 Provision for credit losses 10 2 400.0 General and administrative 847 820 3.3 Corporate 215 166 29.5 Pre-opening 10 13 (23.1) Development 169 140 20.7 Depreciation and amortization 960 875 9.7 Amortization of leasehold interests in land 45 43 4.7 Loss on disposal or impairment of assets 41 22 86.4 Total operating expenses 6,590 5,854 12.6 
 Operating expenses were 6.59 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 736 million compared to 5.85 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases of 430 million in casino expenses, 85 million in depreciation and amortization expense and 49 million in corporate expense. 
 Casino expenses increased 430 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of 312 million and 62 million in gaming taxes at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, consistent with increased casino revenues and a 1 increase in GST in Singapore as of January 1, 2024. 
 Room expenses increased 27 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to increases of 15 million and 12 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, driven by increased occupancy in Macao and higher costs associated with new and elevated suites and rooms introduced at Marina Bay Sands throughout 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024. 
 Food and beverage expenses increased 30 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to increases of 25 million and 5 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, driven by increased business volume at food outlets and banquets operations. 
 Convention, retail and other expenses increased 36 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to increases of 28 million and 8 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. The increase at our Macao operations was primarily due to increases of 12 million in ferry operation expenses due to higher repairs and maintenance and fuel due to additional sailings resulting from increased visitation, 10 million in entertainment expenses due to increased event volume and 6 million in other operating expenses. The increase at Marina Bay Sands was primarily due to increases of 2 million in entertainment, 1 million in convention and 5 million in other operating expenses. 
 Provision for credit losses was 10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in provision was due to an 11 million increase at our Macao operations, partially offset by a 3 million decrease at Marina Bay Sands. The increase at our Macao operations was primarily due to 14 million in settlements from previously reserved accounts in the prior year, partially offset by a 3 million decrease in the provision for the current period. The decrease at Marina Bay Sands was primarily due to a 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 17 million increase in collections on previously reserved accounts, partially offset by a 14 million increase in the provision for the current period. The amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the patrons who owe us money from gaming activities. We believe the amount of our provision for credit losses in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 27 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of 15 million and 12 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, driven by increases in payroll, marketing expenses and facilities and utilities costs. 
 Corporate expenses increased 49 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 19 million related to a shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government, which was finalized on February 7, 2024, and covers the years from 2023 to 2025, an 18 million increase in payroll expenses, an 8 million increase in other expenses driven by information technology costs, professional services and travel costs, and a 4 million decrease in legal fee recoveries. 
 Development expenses were 169 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 140 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increased costs were associated with increased efforts primarily related to our digital gaming pursuits. Development costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 85 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 111 million increase at Marina Bay Sands as a result of the completion of renovations that were placed into service throughout 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024. This increase was partially offset by 30 million decrease at our Macao operations due to assets fully depreciated during the prior year and through the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in depreciation for assets placed into service during the current year. 
 Loss on disposal or impairment of assets was 41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The losses incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were due to a 25 million loss in Macao, including 19 million in demolition costs, primarily related to the upgrade of the Cotai Arena and Phase II of The Londoner Macao, an 8 million loss at Marina Bay Sands, including demolition costs related to room renovation at Marina Bay Sands, and an 8 million loss at corporate primarily due to the sale of an aircraft. 
 Segment Adjusted Property EBITDA 
 The following table summarizes information related to our segments: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Percent Change (Dollars in millions) Macao: The Venetian Macao 843 752 12.1 The Londoner Macao 399 326 22.4 The Parisian Macao 228 201 13.4 The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao 238 237 0.4 Sands Macao 36 42 (14.3) Ferry Operations and Other 12 12 1,756 1,570 11.8 Marina Bay Sands 1,515 1,317 15.0 Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA (1) 
 3,271 2,887 13.3 
 ____________________ 
 (1) Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by management as the primary measure of the operating performance of our segments. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is net income (loss) from before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal or impairment of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance. In particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to compare the operating profitability of our operations with those of 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically reported adjusted property EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP financial measures. In order to view the operations of their properties on a more stand-alone basis, Integrated Resort companies, including LVSC, have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property EBITDA calculations. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We have significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal repayments and income taxes, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property EBITDA. Not all companies calculate adjusted property EBITDA in the same manner. As a result, our presentation of consolidated adjusted property EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

 (a) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of 58 million and 58 million, respectively, of which 39 million and 33 million, respectively, was included in corporate expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Adjusted property EBITDA at our Macao operations increased 186 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased revenues across our operations driven by increased visitation at our Integrated Resorts in Macao. 
 Adjusted property EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands increased 198 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased casino and room operations driven by increased visitation, as well as new and elevated suites and rooms and other amenities introduced at Marina Bay Sands.

 Interest Expense 
 The following table summarizes information related to interest expense: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in millions) Interest cost 
 557 633 Less capitalized interest 
 (10) (5) Interest expense, net 
 547 628 Weighted average total debt balance 
 14,219 15,500 Weighted average interest rate 
 5.0 5.4 
 Interest cost decreased 76 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in the weighted average interest rate from 5.4 to 5.0 and the weighted average total debt balance from 15.50 billion to 14.22 billion. The weighted average interest rate decreased primarily due to lower interest rates on the SCL senior notes in connection with the credit rating upgrades for the Company and SCL to BBB- by S P on July 26, 2023 and Fitch on February 1, 2024, and a decrease in the interest rates on our Singapore Credit Facility. The weighted average total debt balance decreased primarily due to the repayment of 1.95 billion on the SCL Revolving Facility by October 2023 and repurchases totaling 175 million of the 2025 SCL Senior Notes throughout the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Other Factors Affecting Earnings 
 Interest income was 218 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 225 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 7 million, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash available to invest in the U.S. due to share repurchases, dividends and development-related spend in the last twelve months. This decrease was partially offset by an increased paid-in-kind interest rate under the seller financing loan agreement entered into in connection with the sale of our Las Vegas real property and operations and an increase in cash available to invest in Macao. 
 Other income was 16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expense of 17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to foreign currency transaction gains of 11 million driven by U.S. dollar denominated debt held by SCL and 6 million driven by U.S. dollar denominated debt and bank deposits held by Marina Bay Sands. 
 Our income tax expense was 139 million on income before income taxes of 1.50 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a 9.3 effective income tax rate. This compares to an 18.7 effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects a 17 statutory tax rate on our Singapore operations, a 21 corporate income tax on our domestic operations, and a zero percent rate on our Macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in Macao. 
 On February 5, 2024, the Macao government provided notice that VML and its peers received an income tax exemption on gaming operations for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2027. Additionally, we entered into a shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government in February 2024, effective January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025, providing an annual payment as a substitution for a 12 tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits. For the year ended December 31, 2023, income tax expense included an anticipated 57 million shareholder dividend tax based on the information available at the balance sheet date. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we reversed the 57 million income tax expense and recorded 10 million to corporate expense related to the year ended December 31, 2023, to reflect the terms of the new shareholder dividend tax agreement. 
 The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 238 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 123 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts were related to the noncontrolling interest of SCL.

 Additional Information Regarding our Retail Mall Operations 
 We own and operate retail malls at our Integrated Resorts at The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao and Marina Bay Sands. Management believes being in the retail mall business and, specifically, owning some of the largest retail properties in Asia provides meaningful value for us, particularly as the retail market in Asia continues to grow. 
 Our malls are designed to complement our other unique amenities and service offerings provided by our Integrated Resorts. Our strategy is to seek out desirable tenants that appeal to our patrons and provide a wide variety of shopping options. We generate our mall revenues primarily from leases with tenants through minimum base rents, overage rents and reimbursements for common area maintenance and other expenditures. 
 The following tables summarize the results of our mall operations on the Cotai Strip and at Marina Bay Sands for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Note: This table excludes the results of our retail outlets at Sands Macao. 
 (1) Minimum rents include base rents and straight-line adjustments of base rents. 
 (2) Commercial property that generates rental income is exempt from property tax for the first six years for newly constructed buildings in Cotai. If the property also qualifies for Tourism Utility Status, the property tax exemption can be extended to twelve years with effect from the opening of the property. The exemption for The Venetian Macao and The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao expired, and the exemption for The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao will be expiring in December 2027 and September 2028, respectively. 
 (3) Mall-related expenses consist of CAM, marketing fees and other direct operating expenses, property taxes and provision for credit losses, but excludes depreciation and amortization and general and administrative costs. 
 It is common in the mall operating industry for companies to disclose mall net operating income NOI as a useful supplemental measure of a mall s operating performance. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, impairment losses, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, allocations to noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
 In the tables above, we believe taking total mall revenues less mall-related expenses provides an operating performance measure for our malls. Other mall operating companies may use different methodologies for deriving mall-related expenses. As such, this calculation may not be comparable to the NOI of other mall operating companies. 
 
 Development Projects 
 We regularly evaluate opportunities to improve our product offerings, such as refreshing our meeting and convention facilities, suites and rooms, retail malls, restaurant and nightlife mix and our gaming areas, as well as other anticipated revenue-generating additions to our Integrated Resorts.

 As part of the gaming concession entered into by VML and the Macao government, VML has a financial commitment to spend 35.80 billion patacas (approximately 4.47 billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024) through 2032 on both capital and operating projects, including 33.36 billion patacas (approximately 4.17 billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024) in non-gaming projects that will also appeal to international visitors. 
 We continue work on Phase II of The Londoner Macao, which includes the renovation of the rooms in the Sheraton and Conrad hotel towers, an upgrade of the gaming areas and the addition of new attractions, dining, retail and entertainment offerings. The Londoner Grand casino opened on September 26, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 300 newly renovated rooms and suites were available for occupancy at the Londoner Grand. These projects have a total estimated cost of 1.2 billion and are expected to be substantially completed in early 2025.

 Singapore 
 In April 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, Marina Bay Sands Pte. Ltd. MBS and the STB entered into a development agreement (the Second Development Agreement pursuant to which MBS has agreed to construct a development (the MBS Expansion Project on a land parcel adjacent to Marina Bay Sands. 
 The MBS Expansion Project will include a hotel tower with luxury rooms and suites, a rooftop attraction, premium gaming areas, convention and meeting facilities and a state-of-the-art live entertainment arena with approximately 15,000 seats. 
 Our estimated total project cost is approximately 8.0 billion, inclusive of financing fees and interest, land premiums and the purchase of an additional 2,000 square meters of gaming area (the Additional Gaming Area ), increasing Marina Bay Sands total approved gaming area to 17,000 square meters across the existing property and the MBS Expansion Project. 
 We have incurred approximately 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, inclusive of the payment made in 2019 for the lease of the parcels of land underlying the MBS Expansion Project site. The additional payment due to the Singapore government related to the Additional Gaming Area and changes to the MBS Expansion Project gross floor area allocation is estimated to be approximately 1.0 billion and anticipated to be paid no later than in the first quarter of 2025. 
 On April 3, 2024, MBS and the STB entered into a letter agreement, which further extended the construction commencement deadline to July 8, 2025, and the construction completion deadline to July 8, 2029. 
 We will begin construction as soon as government approvals are received, with an estimated commencement date in June 2025. While our current estimate is that construction will be complete June 2030 with an anticipated opening date in January 2031, any extension of the completion date beyond the July 2029 deadline is subject to the approval of the Singapore government. 
 The renovation of Towers 1 and 2 of Marina Bay Sands is now complete and has introduced world class suites and other luxury amenities at a cost of approximately 1.0 billion. We are continuing with the renovation of the Tower 3 hotel rooms into world class suites and other property changes at an estimated cost of approximately 750 million, with an expected completion by 2025. These renovations at Marina Bay Sands are substantially upgrading the overall guest experience for its premium customers, including new dining and retail experiences, and upgrading the casino floor, among other things. These projects are in addition to the MBS Expansion Project.

 Cash Flows Operating Activities 
 Table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. Our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis and to a lesser extent as a trade receivable. Operating cash flows are generally affected by changes in operating income, accounts receivable, gaming related liabilities and interest payments. Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 68 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash generated from operations was primarily due to our Macao and Singapore operations generating increased operating income driven by increased visitation in both Macao and Singapore. The increase was partially offset by decreases in cash related to changes in working capital due to our gaming operations. 
 Cash Flows Investing Activities 
 Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 1.02 billion. Included in this amount was 534 million for construction and development activities in Macao, which consisted of 348 million for The Londoner Macao, 155 million for The Venetian Macao, 11 million for The Parisian Macao, 10 million for Sands Macao, 9 million for The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao and 1 million for ferry operations and other, and 454 million for construction activities at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, primarily due to the room renovations being completed across the property.

 Cash Flows Financing Activities 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities were 2.18 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We utilized 1.30 billion for common stock repurchases and 445 million for dividend payments related to our stockholder return of capital program, and funded 103 million for a forward contract to purchase common stock of SCL to increase our equity ownership in SCL and 50 million for a capped call contract to purchase common stock of LVSC.

 Net cash flows used in financing activities were 2.01 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily attributable to 1.80 billion in repayments on long-term debt, primarily related to the repayment on the SCL revolving facility of 1.70 billion, 153 million in dividend payments, 32 million in deferred offering costs, primarily relating to the amendment and restatement of the 2018 SCL Credit Facility, and 25 million in other financial liability payments. 
 
 Capital Financing Overview 
 We fund our development projects primarily through borrowings from our debt instruments and operating cash flows. 
 On April 3, 2024, LVSC entered into a revolving credit agreement with the arrangers and lenders named therein and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as administrative agent for the lenders (the 2024 LVSC Revolving Credit Agreement ), pursuant to which the lenders provided unsecured, revolving credit commitments to LVSC in an aggregate principal amount of 1.50 billion (the 2024 LVSC Revolving Facility ), which are available until April 3, 2029, and include a 150 million sub-facility for letters of credit. LVSC may utilize the proceeds of the loans for general corporate purposes and working capital requirements of LVSC and its subsidiaries and any other purpose not prohibited by the 2024 LVSC Revolving Credit Agreement. Upon entering into the 2024 LVSC Revolving Credit Agreement, the existing LVSC Revolving Credit Agreement was terminated. The terms and conditions under the 2024 LVSC Revolving Credit Agreement are similar to those under the LVSC Revolving Credit Facility. Refer to Part I Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3 Long-Term Debt for further details. 
 On May 16, 2024, we issued, in an underwritten public offering, three series of senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 1.75 billion (see Part I Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3 Long-Term Debt ). The net proceeds from the offering and cash on hand were used to repay in full the outstanding borrowings under the 3.200 Senior Notes due 2024, resulting in a loss on early retirement of debt of 1 million. 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, SCL repurchased 175 million of the outstanding principal amount of 1.80 billion of its 5.125 Senior Notes due August 8, 2025 2025 SCL Senior Notes ), resulting in a gain on early retirement of debt of approximately 1 million. As of September 30, 2024, the 2025 SCL Senior Notes had a remaining aggregate principal amount of 1.63 billion. 
 On October 23, 2024, SCL entered into a new facility agreement (the 2024 SCL Credit Facility with the arrangers and lenders named therein and Bank of China Limited, Macau Branch, as agent for the lenders. In connection with the entry into the 2024 SCL Credit Facility, the commitments under SCL s existing 2018 SCL Credit Facility terminated. 
 The 2024 SCL Credit Facility provides for a 19.50 billion Hong Kong dollars HKD, approximately 2.51 billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024) unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2024 SCL Revolving Facility ). SCL may draw revolving loans under the 2024 SCL Revolving Facility from time to time until September 24, 2029 (or if that day is not a business day in Hong Kong or Macao, the next business day), for general corporate and working capital requirements of SCL and its subsidiaries, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the 2024 SCL Credit Facility. The final maturity date of all loans drawn under the 2024 SCL Credit Facility is October 23, 2029. 
 The 2024 SCL Credit Facility also makes available an HKD 12.95 billion (approximately 1.67 billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024) unsecured term loan facility (the 2024 SCL Term Loan Facility ). SCL may make a drawdown under the 2024 SCL Term Loan Facility at any time until August 31, 2025, for the purpose of repaying amounts outstanding under its unsecured 5.125 Senior Notes due August 2025. The final maturity date of such loan drawn under the 2024 SCL Term Loan Facility is the date falling on the fifth anniversary of the date on which such loan is drawn.

 Our U.S., SCL and Singapore credit facilities, as amended, contain various financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum leverage ratio, as defined per the respective facility agreements. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S., SCL and Singapore leverage ratios, as defined per the respective credit facility agreements, were 2.54x, 3.11x and 1.54x, respectively, compared to the maximum leverage ratios allowed of 4.00x, 5.00x and 4.50x, respectively. Under the new 2024 SCL Credit Facility, the maximum leverage ratio allowed is 4.00x beginning with the quarterly period ending December 31, 2024. If we are unable to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under these credit facilities, we would be in default under the respective credit facilities. 
 We held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately 4.21 billion and restricted cash of approximately 125 million as of September 30, 2024, of which approximately 2.71 billion of the unrestricted amount is held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the 2.71 billion, approximately 2.16 billion is available to be repatriated, either in the form of dividends or via intercompany loans or advances, to the U.S., subject to levels of earnings, cash flow generated from gaming operations and various other factors, including dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL, compliance with certain local statutes, laws and regulations currently applicable to our subsidiaries and restrictions in connection with their contractual arrangements. We do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise. 
 We believe we have a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity in place, including unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 4.21 billion and cash flow generated from operations, as well as 4.47 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., SCL and Singapore revolving credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, and SGD 3.69 billion (approximately 2.88 billion at exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2024) under our Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility as of September 30, 2024 (only available for draws after the construction cost estimate and construction schedule for the MBS Expansion Project have been delivered to the lenders). We believe we are well positioned to support our operations, maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities and fund our working capital needs, committed and planned capital expenditures, development opportunities, debt obligations and dividend commitments, as well as meet our commitments under the Macao Concession. In the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate global capital markets to consider future opportunities for enhancements of our capital structure. 
 On February 14, May 15 and August 14, 2024, we paid a quarterly dividend of 0.20 per common share as part of a regular cash dividend program and, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, recorded 446 million as a distribution against retained earnings. In October 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.20 per common share (a total estimated to be approximately 145 million) to be paid on November 13, 2024, to stockholders of record on November 5, 2024. Our Board of Directors announced a 0.20 increase in the Company s recurring common stock dividend for the 2025 calendar year, raising the annual dividend to 1.00 per share 0.25 per share per quarter). Our Board of Directors will continue to assess the level of appropriateness of any cash dividends. 
 On September 9, 2024, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Venetian Venture Development II VVDI II ), entered into a Master Confirmation and Supplemental Confirmation (collectively, the Second Forward Purchase Agreement with a financial institution (the Dealer relating to the purchase of the common stock of SCL (the Second Forward Purchase Transaction ), in which VVDI II made an upfront payment of HKD 800 million (approximately 103 million at exchange rates as of the date of the transaction). All purchases under the Second Forward Purchase Transaction were completed by October 22, 2024, with a settlement date of October 28, 2024, when the Dealer will deliver approximately 23 million shares of SCL common stock to us, representing an average price of HKD 14.64 per share. The additional shares will result in an increase of our ownership of SCL to approximately 71.31 . Due to the Second Forward Purchase Transaction reaching the Cap Amount (as defined in the agreement) during the term of the agreement, approximately 59 million will be returned to VVDI II in the form of cash. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 28,746,681 shares of our common stock for 1.31 billion (including commissions and 13 million in excise tax) under our share repurchase program. All share repurchases of our common stock have been recorded as treasury stock. Subsequently, on October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized increasing the remaining share repurchase amount from 195 million to 2.0 billion and extending the share repurchase program s expiration date to November 3, 2026. 
 Repurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, cash flows, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions.

 ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposures to market risk are interest rate risk associated with our long-term debt and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our operations outside the United States, which we may manage through the use of futures, options, caps, forward contracts and similar instruments. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt was approximately 13.72 billion, compared to its contractual value of 13.95 billion. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is based on recent trades, if available, and indicative pricing from market information (level 2 inputs). A hypothetical 100 basis point change in market rates would cause the fair value of our long-term debt to change by 320 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), Hong Kong Inter-Bank Offered Rate HIBOR and Singapore Overnight Rate Average SORA would cause our annual interest cost on our long-term debt to change by approximately 29 million. 
 Foreign currency transaction gains were 16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to U.S. dollar denominated debt issued by SCL. We may be vulnerable to changes in the U.S. dollar/SGD and U.S. dollar/pataca exchange rates. There were no material balances denominated in U.S. dollars related to our Singapore operations as of September 30, 2024; however, these balances fluctuate to support our operations. Based on balances as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 1 weakening of the U.S. dollar/pataca exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately 19 million (net of the impact from the foreign currency swap agreements). The pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar and the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar (within a narrow range). We maintain a significant amount of our operating funds in the same currencies in which we have obligations, thereby reducing our exposure to currency fluctuations. 
 
 ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) of the Company as of September 30, 2024, and have concluded they are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 It should be noted any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that had a material effect, or were reasonably likely to have a material effect, on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Liens created in connection with a project financed with, and created to secure, a Nonrecourse Obligation;

(iii) 
 Liens on any property or Capital Stock of a Person existing at the time the Person becomes a Subsidiary or

(iv) 
 Liens on property or Capital Stock acquired, constructed, altered, improved or repaired by the Company or any
Subsidiary and created prior to, at the time of, or within 360 days (or thereafter if such Lien is created pursuant to a binding commitment entered into prior to, at the time of or within 360 days) after such acquisition (including, without
limitation, acquisition through merger or consolidation), construction, alteration, improvement or repair (or the completion of such construction, alteration, improvement or repair or commencement of commercial operation of such property, whichever
is later) to secure or provide for the payment of all or any part of the price thereof so long as such Liens are no greater than the payment or price, as the case may be, for the property or Capital Stock acquired, constructed, altered, improved or

amount of Indebtedness existing at the time of such extension, renewal or replacement (plus an amount equal to any premiums, accrued interest, fees, expenses or other costs payable in connection therewith). 

(c) 
 Any Lien that is granted to secure the Facility under this Section 2 shall be automatically released and
discharged at the same time as the release of the Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Facility under this Section 2. 

(d) 
 For the avoidance of doubt, an increase in the amount of Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of
interest, accretion of accreted value, amortization of original issue discount, payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and accretion of original issue discount and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness, shall not constitute an assumption, incurrence or guarantee for the purposes of this Section 2, so
long as the original Liens securing such Indebtedness were permitted under this Agreement. 

(e) 
 Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, the Company and its Subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly, incur,
assume or guarantee any Indebtedness secured by Liens not otherwise permitted by this Section 2 if the sum of (i) the aggregate of all Indebtedness secured by such Liens and (ii) any Attributable Debt related to any sale and leaseback
arrangement permitted under Section 3(b) below does not exceed the greater of (i) 15.0 of the Company s total Consolidated Net Assets and (ii) US 1.4 billion. 

(f)

 the sale and leaseback arrangement involves a lease for a term of not more than three years;

(b) 
 the sale and leaseback arrangement is entered into between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries;

(c)

Property at least equal in amount to the Attributable Debt permitted pursuant Section 2(a) without having to secure equally and rateably the Facility; 

(d) 
 the lease payment is created in connection with a project financed with, and such obligation constitutes, a
Nonrecourse Obligation; 

(e) 
 the proceeds of the sale and leaseback arrangement are at least equal to the fair market value (as determined
by the Company s Board of Directors in good faith) of the Principal Property and the Company applies within 180 days after the sale an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of the sale or the Attributable Debt associated with the
Principal Property to (i) the retirement of long-term debt for borrowed money that is not subordinated to the Facility and that is not debt to the Company or a Subsidiary, or (ii) the purchase, construction, improvement, expansion or
development of other comparable property; or 

(f) 
 the sale and leaseback arrangement is entered into within 180 days after the initial acquisition of the
Principal Property subject to the sale and leaseback arrangement. Section 4: Limitations on Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
Assets The Company shall not, directly or indirectly: 

(a) 
 consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Company is the surviving entity); or

(b) 
 sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of

(ii) 
 the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or the Person to

(iii) 
 immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing,
 provided that failure to comply with this Section 4 shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default if the
underlying events or circumstances of such failure constitute a Change of Control (in which case Clause 7.2 Change of control shall apply).
