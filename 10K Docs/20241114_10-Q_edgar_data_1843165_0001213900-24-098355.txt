IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY 

As
a company with less than 1.235 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging
growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act, as
modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage
of specified reduced disclosure and other exemptions from requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not
emerging growth companies. These provisions include: 

Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 

Exemptions from non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute; and 

Exemption from auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue
of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of the common equity securities
pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible
debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. 

In
addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with
new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards
until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying
with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the
date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided
in the JOBS Act.

Stock Dividend in the
Form of Stock Split 

In February 2024, the Board
of Directors declared a stock dividend for distribution to all of the Company s shareholders of record at the close of
business on February 12, 2024. On March 1, 2024, shares were issued per the dividend. As a result of the stock dividend,

and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and has negative cash flows from operations
of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company requires additional capital to operate and expects losses to continue
for the foreseeable future. These factors raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s ability
to continue as a going concern until it reaches profitability is dependent upon its ability to generate cash from operating activities
and to raise additional capital to fund operations. Management plans to raise additional capital to fund operations through debt and/or
equity financings. Our failure to raise additional capital could have a negative impact on not only our
financial condition but also our ability to execute our business plan. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in
these efforts. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all.

Under Regulation S-X 3-05,
management determined that the CWS Platform acquisition constituted a business combination as the revenue producing activity (e-commerce
sales) is expected to be similar both pre and post-domain name acquisition. As such, the Company recorded an intangible asset of 
for the purchase price consideration of the domain name. 

Management assessed the fair
value of the Domain Name and CWS Platform in determining to allocate the to the domain name. In making such determination, management
considered the related party nature of the transaction, the current environment for direct-to-consumer alcoholic beverage companies and
the related competition in which they operate, and the fact that the initial and continued operation of the CWS platform is completely
dependent on the relationship between the Company, our CEO and a minority shareholder, who co-owned SSquared and operates KBROS, LLC KBROS ,
or Product Handler ), the Company s contracted product handler. Without such relationship, which can be terminated
in certain circumstances, the underlying CWS Platform would be unable to operate as intended until a suitable alterative product handler
would be identified. Therefore, no fair value in excess of the consideration provided was considered. 

The Company has consolidated
the results of operations of the CWS Platform since November 1, 2023.

Net Loss 

Net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 8,000,066 and 9,419,793, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 247,913 and 7,064,348 respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we also
had 3,439,467 in marketable securities. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through issuances of common stock and sales
of our products and services. 

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated profits since inception, has sustained
net losses of 8,000,066 and 9,419,793 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and has negative cash flows from operations
of 3,565,293 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company requires additional capital to operate
and expects losses to continue for the foreseeable future. These factors raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. 

The Company s ability
to continue as a going concern until it reaches profitability is dependent upon its ability to generate cash from operating activities
and to raise additional capital to fund operations. Management is exploring various strategies, including customer acquisition and new
partnerships, to increase volume in order to achieve better gross margins and profitability. The Company continues to seek investment
and acquisition opportunities which will help achieve its strategies. 

Management plans to raise
additional capital to fund operations through debt and/or equity financings. Our failure to raise additional
capital could have a negative impact on not only our financial condition but also our ability to execute our business plan. No assurance
can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable
terms, or at all.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

This discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based
on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are
described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that the following
accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant
areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 

There have
been no material changes in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and are not required
to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even disclosure controls and procedures
determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved. 

As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e))
pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective at a reasonable assurance level. 

Our size has prevented us from being able to employ
sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation of duties. Therefore, it is difficult to effectively
segregate accounting duties which comprise a material weakness in internal controls. This lack of segregation of duties leads management
to conclude that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to give reasonable assurance that the information
required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and
when required. 

To the extent reasonably possible given our limited
resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including, but not limited to, increasing the capacity of
our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization and that we
have adequate control over our Exchange Act reporting disclosures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
procedures over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Board of Directors approved a share buyback program under which the Company can repurchase up to 20 of its common stock in open
market and privately negotiated purchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The Company engaged and entered
into an agreement with Dominari Securities LLC Dominari on August 28, 2023, to effect the share buyback program. The
