 Revolving Credit Facility Term Loan 
 In December 2021, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a group of banks to refinance the existing credit facility as well as provide funds for ongoing working capital and other general corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility provides a unsecured revolving credit facility and an uncommitted accordion feature which allows the Company to request an increase in the borrowing commitments, or incremental term loans, under the credit facility in aggregate principal amounts of up to . Borrowings under this agreement bear interest, at the Company's election, at either the base rate plus a margin that ranges from to basis points based on net leverage ratio or SOFR plus a margin that ranges from to basis points based on the net leverage ratio. Borrowing capacity under this facility, without exercising the accordion feature, totaled and at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and are available to fund future acquisitions or other capital and operating requirements. These amounts are net of outstanding letters of credit of and at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, to secure certain insurance obligations. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility was and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Additionally, the Company had letters of credit outstanding not associated with the revolving credit agreement, in the amount of and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, in order to secure certain insurance obligations. 
 Trade Receivable Securitization Facility 
 In August 2018, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the AR Securitization Facility ). The AR Securitization Facility effectively increases the Company s borrowing capacity by collateralizing a portion of the amount of the U.S. operations trade accounts receivable. The Company uses the proceeds from the AR Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs. The AR Securitization Facility's maximum borrowing capacity is , fees on amounts borrowed are per year, and the term goes to August 4, 2026. Borrowing capacity is further subject to changes in the credit ratings of our customers, customer concentration levels or certain characteristics of the accounts receivable portfolio and, therefore, at certain times, we may not be able to fully access the of borrowing capacity available under the AR Securitization Facility. Borrowings under the AR Securitization Facility carry variable interest rates tied to SOFR.

The interest rate swap effectively converts a portion of the floating rate interest payment into a fixed rate interest payment. The Company designated the interest rate swap as a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap instrument and is accounting for this derivative as a cash flow hedge. During fiscal 2021, the Company completed a transaction to amend and extend the interest rate swap agreement which resulted in an extension of the maturity date to January 31, 2026. The pay-fixed interest rate swap is considered a hybrid instrument with a financing component and an embedded at-market derivative that was designated as a cash flow hedge. The weighted average fixed pay rate is and the interest rate swap is indexed to SOFR. The Company made various accounting elections related to changes in critical terms of the hedging relationship due to reference rate reform to preserve the hedging relationship.

 ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

With more than 6,500 employees across North Central America, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, Applied Industrial Technologies Applied, the Company, we, us, or our is a leading value-added distributor and technical solutions provider of industrial motion, fluid power, flow control, automation technologies, and related maintenance supplies. Our leading brands, specialized services, and comprehensive knowledge serve MRO (Maintenance, Repair Operations) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) end users in virtually all industrial markets through our multi-channel capabilities that provide choice, convenience, and expertise. We have a long tradition of growth dating back to 1923, the year our business was founded in Cleveland, Ohio. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, business was conducted in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Costa Rica from 593 facilities. 
 The following is Management's Discussion and Analysis of significant factors which affected our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income and consolidated cash flows. When reviewing the discussion and analysis set forth below, please note that the SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) we sell in any given period may not necessarily be sold in the comparable period of the prior year, resulting in the inability to quantify certain commonly used comparative metrics analyzing sales, such as changes in product mix and volume. 
 Overview 
 Consolidated sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.8 million or 0.3 compared to the prior year quarter, with acquisitions increasing sales by 22.0 million or 2.0 and unfavorable foreign currency translation of 3.5 million reducing sales by 0.3 . Operating margin was 10.3 of sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.0 of sales for the same quarter in the prior year. Net income of 92.1 million decreased 1.9 compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Applied monitors several economic indices that have been key indicators for industrial economic activity in the United States. These include the Industrial Production (IP) and Manufacturing Capacity Utilization (MCU) indices published by the Federal Reserve Board and the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). Historically, our performance correlates well with the MCU, which measures productivity and calculates a ratio of actual manufacturing output versus potential full capacity output. When manufacturing plants are running at a high rate of capacity, they tend to wear out machinery and require replacement parts. 
 The MCU (total industry) and IP indice s declined slightly since J une 2024. The ISM PMI registered 47.2 in September, down from the June 2024 reading of 48.5. The indices for the months during the current quarter, along with the indices for the prior fiscal year end, were as follows: 
 Index Reading Month MCU PMI IP September 2024 77.5 47.2 99.1 August 2024 77.8 47.2 99.5 July 2024 77.6 46.8 99.0 June 2024 78.2 48.5 99.5 
 
 The number of Company employees was 6,549 at September 30, 2024, 6,562 at June 30, 2024, and 6,359 at September 30, 2023. The number of operating facilities totaled 593 at September 30, 2024, 590 at June 30, 2024 and 589 at September 30, 2023.

Excluding the impact of businesses acquired and foreign currency translation, sales were down 14.7 million or 1.4 during the quarter , driven by a decrease of 3.0 primarily due to lower operating activity in the Engineered Solutions segment although demand improved during the quarter, offset by an increase of 1.6 due to one additional sales day. 
 The following table shows changes in sales by reportable segment (amounts in millions). 
 Sales by Reportable Segment Three Months Ended September 30, Sales Increase Amount of change due to Foreign Currency Organic Change 2024 2023 Acquisitions Service Center Based Distribution 749.7 746.5 3.2 5.5 (3.5) 1.2 Engineered Solutions 349.2 348.6 0.6 16.5 (15.9) Total 1,098.9 1,095.1 3.8 22.0 (3.5) (14.7)

The following table shows changes in sales by geographic area. Other countries includes Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Costa Rica (amounts in millions). 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Sales (Decrease) Increase Amount of change due to Foreign Currency Organic Change Sales by Geographic Area 2024 2023 Acquisitions United States 957.2 959.3 (2.1) 10.1 (12.2) Canada 71.5 75.3 (3.8) (1.3) (2.5) Other countries 70.2 60.5 9.7 11.9 (2.2) Total 1,098.9 1,095.1 3.8 22.0 (3.5) (14.7) 
 Sales in the United States were down 2.1 million or 0.2 , as acquisitions added 10.1 million or 1.0 . Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, U.S. sales were down 12.2 million or 1.2 , driven by a 2.8 decrease from operations, offset by an increase of 1.6 due to one additional sales day. Sales in Canada decreased 3.8 million or 5.1 . Unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased Canadian sales by 1.3 million or 1.6 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Canadian sales were down 2.5 million or 3.5 , driven by a 5.1 decrease from operations, offset by an increase of 1.6 due to one additional sales day. Sales in other countries increased 9.7 million or 16.0 from the prior year quarter primarily due to acquisitions contributing 11.9 million or 19.7 , offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 2.2 million or 3.7 . 
 Our gross profit margin was 29.6 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 29.7 in the prior period . Gross profit margin contracted year over year primarily due to the favorable impact of vendor rebates in the prior year, offset by 24 basis points favorable impact in the current year quarter due to a 2.6 million decrease in LIFO expense. 
 The following table shows the changes in selling, distribution and administrative expense (SD A) (amounts in millions). 
 Three Months Ended September 30, SD A Increase Amount of change due to Foreign Currency Organic Change 2024 2023 Acquisitions SD A 211.9 204.4 7.5 6.6 (0.7) 1.6 
 SD A consists of associate compensation, benefits and other expenses associated with selling, purchasing, warehousing, supply chain management and providing marketing and distribution of the Company's products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as human resources, information technology, treasury, accounting, insurance, legal, and facility related expenses. SD A was 19.3 of sales in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18.7 in the prior year quarter, an increase of 7.5 million or 3.7 compared to the prior year quarter. SD A from businesses acquired added 6.6 million or 3.2 of SD A expenses, including 0.9 million of intangibles amortization related to acquisitions. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing SD A during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 by 0.7 million or 0.3 compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired and the favorable currency translation impact, SD A increased 1.6 million or 0.8 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Operating income decreased 7.5 million or 6.2 , and as a percent of sales decreased to 10.3 from 11.0 during the prior year quarter. 
 Operating income, as a percentage of sales for the Service Center Based Distribution segment decreased to 12.6 in the current year quarter from 13.0 in the prior year quarter. Operating income as a percentage of sales for the Engineered Solutions segment decreased to 13.8 in the current year quarter from 14.2 in the prior year quarter. 
 The Company had net interest income in the current year quarter of 0.6 million compared to net i nterest expense of 1.3 million in the prior year quarter due to reduced debt levels and greater interest income from higher cash balances and investment yields. 
 Other (income) expense, net, which represents certain non-operating items of income and expense, was income of 2.3 million in the current year quarter compared to expense of 0.4 million in the prior year quarter. Current quarter income primarily consists of unrealized gains on investments held by non-qualified deferred compensation trusts of 1.2 million, foreign currency transaction gains of 0.9 million, and other income of 0.2 million. Other expense, net in the prior year quarter consisted 
 18

 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

primarily of unrealized losses on investments held by non-qualified deferred compensation trusts of 0.6 million, offset by 0.2 million of other income. 
 The effective income tax rate was 20.7 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.1 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate over the prior year is primarily due to an increase in compensation-related deductions during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We expect our full year tax rate for fiscal 2025 to be in the 23.0 to 24.0 range. 
 As a result of the factors addressed above, net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.8 million or 1.9 compared to the prior year quarter. Diluted net income per share was 2.36 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.39 per share in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 1.3 . 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary source of capital is cash flow from operations, supplemented as necessary by bank borrowings or other sources of debt. We had total debt obligations outstanding of 597.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 597.4 million at June 30, 2024. Management expects that our existing cash, cash equivalents, funds available under the revolving credit facility, and cash provided from operations will be sufficient to finance normal working capital needs in each of the countries in which we operate, payment of dividends, acquisitions, investments in properties, facilities and equipment, debt service, and the purchase of additional Company common stock. Management also believes that additional long-term debt and line of credit financing could be obtained based on the Company's credit standing and financial strength. 
 The Company's working capital at September 30, 2024 was 1,331.3 million, compared to 1,268.8 million at June 30, 2024. The current ratio was 3.8 to 1 at September 30, 2024 and 3.5 to 1 at June 30, 2024. 
 Net Cash Flows 
 The following table is included to aid in review of Applied's condensed statements of consolidated cash flows (amounts in thousands). 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Net Cash Provided by (Used in): 2024 2023 Operating Activities 127,747 66,209 Investing Activities (15,216) (25,657) Financing Activities (34,047) (22,483) Exchange Rate Effect (581) (1,690) Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents 77,903 16,379 
 The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the prior period is due to changes in working capital for the period of 61.8 million, driven primarily by (amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Accounts receivable 33,641 16,142 Accounts payable (2,307) (43,008) 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the prior period primarily due to 10.5 million used for acquisitions in the current year quarter compared to 21.4 million used for acquisitions in the prior year quarter. 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the prior quarter primarily due to 10.0 million used to repurchase 52,000 shares of common stock which were taken into treasury in the current year quarter. No shares were repurchased in the prior year quarter. 
 Share Repurchases 
 The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company's common stock. These purchases may be made in open market and negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending upon market conditions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company acquired 52,000 shares of the Company's common stock on the open market at an average price per share of 191.92. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not acquire any

 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

shares of the Company's common stock on the open market. At September 30, 2024, we had authorization to repurchase 1,050,000 shares. 
 Borrowing Arrangements 
 A summary of long-term debt, including the current portion, follows (amounts in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Revolving credit facility 384,000 384,000 Trade receivable securitization facility 188,300 188,300 Series E notes 25,000 25,000 Other 42 105 Total debt 597,342 597,405 Less: unamortized debt issuance costs 51 71 597,291 597,334 
 Revolving Credit Facility Term Loan 
 In December 2021, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a group of banks to refinance the existing credit facility as well as provide funds for ongoing working capital and other general corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility provides a 900.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and an uncommitted accordion feature which allows the Company to request an increase in the borrowing commitments, or incremental term loans, under the credit facility in aggregate principal amounts of up to 500.0 million . Borrowings under this agreement bear interest, at the Company's election, at either the base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0 to 55 basis points based on net leverage ratio or SOFR plus a margin that ranges from 80 to 155 basis points based on the net leverage ratio. Borrowing capacity under this facility, without exercising the accordion feature, totaled 515.8 million and 515.8 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and are available to fund future acquisitions or other capital and operating requirements. These amounts are net of outstanding letters of credit of 0.2 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, to secure certain insurance obligations. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 5.75 and 6.24 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Additionally, the Company had letters of credit outstanding not associated with the revolving credit agreement, in the amount of 5.3 million and 4.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, in order to secure certain insurance obligations. 
 Trade Receivable Securitization Facility 
 In August 2018, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the AR Securitization Facility ). The AR Securitization Facility effectively increases the Company s borrowing capacity by collateralizing a portion of the amount of the U.S. operations trade accounts receivable. The Company uses the proceeds from the AR Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs. The AR Securitization Facility's maximum borrowing capacity is 250.0 million , fees on amounts borrowed are 0.90 per year, and the term goes to August 4, 2026. Borrowing capacity is further subject to changes in the credit ratings of our customers, customer concentration levels or certain characteristics of the accounts receivable portfolio and, therefore, at certain times, we may not be able to fully access the 250.0 million of borrowing capacity available under the AR Securitization Facility. Borrowings under the AR Securitization Facility carry variable interest rates tied to SOFR. The interest rate on the AR Securitization Facility as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was 5.85 and 6.35 , respectively. 
 Unsecured Shelf Facility 
 At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had borrowings outstanding under its unsecured shelf facility agreement with Prudential Investment Management of 25.0 million . Fees on this facility range from 0.25 to 1.25 per year based on the Company's leverage ratio at each quarter end. The Series E notes have a principal amount of 25.0 million , carry a fixed interest rate of 3.08 , and are due on October 30, 2024. 
 Other Long-Term Borrowing 
 In 2014, the Company assumed 2.4 million of debt as a part of the headquarters facility acquisition. The 1.50 fixed interest rate note is held by the State of Ohio Development Services Agency, and matures in November 2024. 
 The Company entered into an interest rate swap which mitigates variability in forecasted interest payments on 384.0 million of the Company s U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured variable rate debt. For more information, see note 6, Derivatives, to the

consolidated financial statements, included in Item 1 under the caption Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The credit facility and the unsecured shelf facility contain restrictive covenants regarding liquidity, net worth, financial ratios, and other covenants. At September 30, 2024, the most restrictive of these covenants required that the Company have net indebtedness less than 3.75 times consolidated income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined). At September 30, 2024, the Company's net indebtedness was less than 0.2 times consolidated income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined). The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 Accounts Receivable Analysis 
 The following table is included to aid in analysis of accounts receivable and the associated provision for losses on accounts receivable (amounts in thousands): 
 September 30, June 30, 2024 2024 Accounts receivable, gross 704,683 737,941 Less: allowance for doubtful accounts 13,171 13,063 Accounts receivable, net 691,512 724,878 Allowance for doubtful accounts, of gross receivables 1.9 1.8 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Provision for losses on accounts receivable 1,056 867 Provision as a of net sales 0.10 0.08 
 Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and consist of trade receivables from customers. Management monitors accounts receivable by reviewing Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and the aging of receivables for each of the Company's locations. 
 On a consolidated basis, DSO was 56.6 at September 30, 2024 compared to 56.2 at June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 1.6 of our accounts receivable balances are more than 90 days past due, compared to 1.5 at June 30, 2024. On an overall basis, our provision for losses from uncollected receivables represents 0.10 of our sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.08 of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily relates to recoveries recorded in the prior year primarily in the U.S. operations of the Service Center Based Distribution segment. H istorically, this percentage is around 0.10 to 0.15 . Management believes the overall receivables aging and provision for losses on uncollected receivables are at reasonable levels. 
 Inventory Analysis 
 Inventories are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for U.S. inventories and the average cost method for foreign inventories. Management uses an inventory turnover ratio to monitor and evaluate inventory. Management calculates this ratio on an annual as well as a quarterly basis, and believes that using average costs to determine the inventory turnover ratio instead of LIFO costs provides a more useful analysis. The annualized inventory turnover based on average costs was 4.3 for both the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.
