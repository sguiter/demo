On April 25, 2023 , the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement to refinance its senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility ). Under the terms of the Credit Agreement the borrowing capacity is million. The Facility matures in . In connection with the refinancing, the Company incurred approximately million in financing costs which were deferred and are amortized over the life of the Facility. , plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) for base rate borrowings, the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus and (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR rate (subject to a 0.00 floor) for a one-month interest period plus , in each case plus the Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin initially was 1.125 for SOFR rate borrowings and for base rate borrowings, and after September 30, 2023, can fluctuate, determined by reference to the more favorable to the Company of its (i) public debt rating and (ii) consolidated leverage ratio, as specified in the Credit Agreement. Up to million of the Facility may be used for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement enables the Company, from time to time, to add term loans or to increase the revolving credit commitment in an aggregate amount not to exceed million . 

 9 

million, which approximated fair value. Outstanding letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under the Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were issued letters of credit under the Facility, resulting in undrawn availability under the Facility of million. The weighted average interest rate for the Facility was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In 2017, the Company issued million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes due in . The interest rate on these senior notes may be increased by each time a credit rating applicable to the notes is downgraded. The maximum rate is . The effective interest rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was inclusive of an approximately benefit of treasury locks. Based on quoted prices the fair value of th e senior unsecured notes due in 2027 was million at September 30, 2024. In 2015, the Company issued million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes due in . In accordance with ASC 470-10-45-14, the Company classified the Senior Unsecured Notes due in August 2025 as long-term debt at September 30, 2024 due to the Company s intent to refinance the senior notes on a long term basis and the Company s ability to consummate such refinancing as the Company has the ability to draw on the Credit Agreement for the full amount of the Company s obligations under the senior notes. Such borrowings would be on terms exceeding one year as the Credit Agreement matures in April 2028 and the Credit Agreement is not unilaterally cancellable by the lender. The interest rate on these senior notes may be increased by each time a credit rating applicable to the notes is downgraded. The maximum rate is . The effective interest rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was . Based on quoted prices, the fair value of the senior unsecured notes due in 2025 was million at September 30, 2024. 

interest rate swap agreements outstanding. The Company had treasury lock agreements, designated as cash flow hedges, to protect against unfavorable movements in the benchmark treasury rate related to the issuance of our senior unsecured notes. As part of the issuance of our senior notes, we net settled these derivatives for million in cash and the deferred gains recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) will be released to interest expense over the life of the senior notes. The effect of these settled treasury locks reduces the effective interest rate on the senior notes by approximately . Cross Currency and Interest Rate Swap Agreements In November 2020, we entered into a cross currency and interest rate swap, which is designated as a cash flow hedge of a million, -year amortizing, intercompany loan between one of our European subsidiaries and the U.S. parent company. Changes in the spot exchange rates are recorded to the general ledger and offset the fair value re-measurement of the hedged item. The net difference in the interest rates coupons is recorded as a credit to interest expense. The derivative swaps million bearing interest at a fixed rate of for million at a fixed rate interest of . The interest coupons settle . The principal will amortize each year on November 15, as follows: for years 1 through 4, beginning November 15, 2021, million versus million, and a final settlement on November 15, 2025 of million versus million. Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts A number of our European subsidiaries are exposed to the impact of exchange rate volatility between the U.S. dollar and the subsidiaries functional currencies, being either the Euro or the British pound sterling. We have entered into contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for Euros and British pound sterling through March 2027. The aggregate notional amount of these contracts was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge a portion of the forecasted transactions of our European subsidiaries under long-term sales contracts with certain customers. These contracts are expected to provide us with a more balanced matching of future cash receipts and expenditures by currency, thereby 

 10 

million and million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and losses of million and million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). We recognized losses of million and million in gross margin during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and losses of million and million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts which are not designated as hedges. These are used to provide an offset to transactional gains or losses arising from the remeasurement of non-functional monetary assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable. The change in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in the statement of operations. There are credit contingency features in these derivatives. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net foreign exchange gains of million and million, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized net foreign exchange losses of million and million, respectively. The net foreign exchange impact recognized from these contracts offsets the translation exposure of these transactions.

Unrealized gains of million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, less taxes of million, as of September 30, 2024, are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months as the hedged sales are recorded. Commodity Swap Agreements We use commodity swap agreements to hedge against price fluctuations of raw materials, including propylene (the principal component of acrylonitrile). As of September 30, 2024, we had commodity swap agreements with a notional value of million. The swaps mature monthly through September 2026. The swaps are accounted for as a cash flow hedge of our forward raw material purchases. To ensure the swaps are highly effective, all of the critical terms of the swap matched the terms of the hedged items.

assets or liabilities that utilize Level 1 inputs. However, we have derivative instruments classified as liabilities and assets which utilize Level 2 inputs, and liability that utilizes Level 3 inputs. For derivative assets and liabilities that utilize Level 2 inputs, we prepare estimates of future cash flows of our derivatives, which are discounted to a net present value. The estimated cash flows and the discount factors used in the valuation model are based on observable inputs and incorporate non-performance risk (the credit standing of the counterparty when the derivative is in a net asset position, and the credit standing of Hexcel when the derivative is in a net liability position). For further information on the fair value of our derivative financial instruments see Note 6, Derivative Financial Instruments. In addition, the fair value of these derivative contracts, which are subject to a master netting arrangement under certain circumstances, is presented on a gross basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for all Level 2 financial assets and liabilities: Cross Currency and Interest Rate Swap Agreements valued using the USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate curves and quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting date. 

 Foreign exchange derivative assets and liabilities valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting date.

 Counterparties to the above contracts are highly rated financial institutions, of which experienced any significant downgrades in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that would reduce the receivable amount owed, if any, to the Company. 

Less than half of our agreements contain provisions which would require revenue to be recognized over time. All other revenue is recognized at a point in time. We disaggregate our revenue based on market for analytical purposes.

In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision ROD setting forth the EPA s selected remedy for the lower miles of the Lower Passaic River at an expected cost ranging from billion to billion. In August 2017, the EPA appointed an independent third-party allocation expert to make recommendations on the relative liability of approximately identified non-government PRPs for the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River. In December 2020, the allocator issued its non-binding report on PRP liability (including Hexcel s) to the EPA. In October 2021, the EPA released a ROD selecting an interim remedy for the upper miles of the Lower Passaic River at an expected additional cost ranging from million to million. In October 2016, pursuant to a settlement agreement with the EPA, Occidental Chemical Corporation OCC ), one of the PRPs, commenced performance of the remedial design required by the ROD for the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, reserving its right of cost contribution from all other PRPs. In June 2018, OCC filed suit against approximately 120 parties, including Hexcel, in the U.S. District Court of the District of New Jersey seeking cost recovery and contribution under CERCLA related to the Lower Passaic River. In July 2019, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion to dismiss. In August 2020, the court granted defendants motion for summary judgment for certain claims. Discovery for the remaining claims has been stayed indefinitely based on agreement of the parties. On February 24, 2021, Hexcel and certain other defendants filed a third-party complaint against the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission and certain New Jersey municipalities seeking recovery of Passaic-related cleanup costs incurred by defendants, as well as contribution for any cleanup costs incurred by OCC for which the court deems the defendants liable. In March 2023, the EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order UAO to OCC ordering OCC to commence remedial design work for the interim remedy for the cleanup of the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River. On March 24, 2023, OCC filed suit against Hexcel and approximately other parties claiming cost recovery under CERCLA for future costs related to its compliance with the UAO. On January 5, 2024, the U.S. District Court stayed the foregoing claim initiated by OCC until the completion of the Passaic-related Consent Decree process. On December 16, 2022, the EPA lodged a Consent Decree with the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey requesting court approval of a million settlement of the EPA s CERCLA claims against Hexcel and other PRPs for costs related to alleged contamination of the upper and lower portions of the Lower Passaic River. The PRPs have collectively placed million in escrow, pending District Court approval of the Consent Decree. Hexcel is unable to estimate when or if the District Court will approve the Consent Decree. Summary of Environmental Reserves Our estimate of liability as a PRP and our remaining costs associated with our responsibility to remediate the Lower Passaic River and other sites are accrued in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our aggregate environmental related accruals were million and million, respectively. These amounts were included in non-current liabilities. These accruals can change significantly from period to period due to such factors as additional information on the nature or extent of contamination, the methods of remediation required, changes in the apportionment of costs among responsible parties and other actions by governmental agencies or private parties, or the impact, if any, of being named in a new matter.

I TEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Business Overview 
 We develop, manufacture, and market lightweight, high-performance structural materials, including carbon fiber, specialty reinforcements, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, honeycomb, resins, engineered core and composite structures for use in Commercial Aerospace, Space Defense, and Industrial markets. We propel the future of flight, energy generation, transportation, and recreation through excellence in providing innovative high-performance material solutions that are lighter, stronger and tougher, helping to create a better world for us. 
 We serve international markets through manufacturing facilities, sales offices and representatives located in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, India, and Africa. 
 We are a manufacturer of products within a single industry: Advanced Composites. We have two reportable segments: Composite Materials and Engineered Products. The Composite Materials segment is comprised of our carbon fiber, specialty reinforcements, resin systems, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, and honeycomb core product lines and pultruded profiles. The Engineered Products segment is comprised of lightweight high strength composite structures, radio frequency/electromagnetic interference RF/EMI and microwave absorbing materials, engineered core and specialty machined honeycomb products with added functionality and thermoplastic additive manufacturing. 
 Our business is continuing to recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by growth in air travel and an increase in aircraft build rates. The post-recovery period continues to have many challenges across the markets Hexcel operates in, including delays in aircraft production rates, related to, among other impacts, global logistics, supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, and effects from geopolitical issues and conflicts. These challenges have had and may continue to have further negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, all of which have and may continue to compress our financial results.

 Engineered Products: For the third quarter of 2024, net sales of 88.9 million increased 9.9 million or 12.5 as compared to the prior year quarter. Net sales of 273.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 increased 16.7 compared to the same period last year. The increase for both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the respective periods in the prior year was driven by higher Commercial Aerospace and Space Defense sales. 
 
 Sales by Market 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, Commercial Aerospace sales of 295.9 million increased 17.5 (17.0 in constant currency) compared to the third quarter of 2023. Airbus programs drove the sales growth including the A350 and A320neo. Boeing 787 sales also increased. Other Commercial Aerospace sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 9.1 compared to the third quarter of 2023 with growth led by the latest-generation business jet sales. Sales of 915.9 million increased 14.4 (14.3 in constant currency) for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Growth was led by the A350, 787, and A320neo.

 Under the Facility, total borrowings at September 30, 2024 were 105.0 million, which approximated fair value. The Facility agreement permits us to issue letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of 50.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, there were no issued letters of credit under the Facility, resulting in undrawn availability under the Facility of 645.0 million. The weighted average interest rate for the Facility was 6.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For further information regarding our Facility, see Note 5, Debt, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements (including capital expenditures) through net cash from operating activities, cash on hand and the Facility, as well as access to capital markets. As of September 30, 2024, long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our long-term debt obligations. 
 
 The remaining authorization under the share repurchase program at September 30, 2024 was 234.9 million. On October 21, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.15 per share payable to stockholders of record as of November 1, 2024, with a payment date of November 8, 2024. 
 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 127.3 million compared to 98.1 million for the same period last year. Working capital was a cash use of 93.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to a use of 112.1 million in the same period in 2023 with the variance primarily attributable to higher payables and accruals in 2024. 
 Investing Activities: Net cash used for investing activities was 68.4 million and 81.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2024 were 68.4 million as compared to 94.4 million for the same period last year, which also included approximately 38.0 million for the acquisition of the land and building at our Amesbury, Massachusetts facility. The nine months ended September 30, 2023, also included proceeds of 10.3 million from the sale of the Windsor facility. 
 Financing Activities: Net cash used for financing activities was 187.8 million for first nine months of 2024 compared to a net cash use of 29.7 million in the same period in 2023.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments 
 21 

that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors management believes to be relevant at the time our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 
 We describe our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 We are involved in litigation, investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of our business, including those relating to commercial transactions, environmental, employment and health and safety matters. We estimate and accrue our liabilities resulting from such matters based upon a variety of factors, including the stage of the proceeding; potential settlement value; assessments by internal and external counsel; and assessments by environmental engineers and consultants of potential environmental liabilities and remediation costs. We believe we have adequately accrued for these potential liabilities; however, facts and circumstances may change, such as new developments, or a change in approach, including a change in settlement strategy or in an environmental remediation plan, or in our existing insurance coverage, that could cause the actual liability to exceed the estimates, or may require adjustments to the recorded liability balances in the future. For further discussion, see Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, including sales and expenses measured in constant dollars (prior year sales and expenses measured at current year exchange rates); operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for items included in operating expense and non-operating expenses; and free cash flow. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are meaningful to investors because they provide a view of Hexcel with respect to ongoing operating results and comparisons to prior periods. These adjustments can represent significant charges or credits that we believe are important to an understanding of Hexcel s overall operating results in the periods presented. Such non-GAAP measures are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to or substitutes for GAAP measures of performance. Our calculation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and the measures exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Reconciliations to adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted net income per share and free cash flow are provided below.

 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements also relate to future prospects, developments and business strategies. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, seek, target, would, will and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. Such statements are based on current expectations, are inherently uncertain and are subject to changing assumptions. 
 Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (a) the estimates and expectations based on aircraft production rates provided by Airbus, Boeing and others and the revenues we may generate from an aircraft model or program; (b) expectations with regard to the impact of regulatory activity related to the Boeing 737 MAX or Boeing 787 on our revenues; (c) expectations with regard to raw material cost and availability; (d) expectations of composite content on new commercial aircraft programs and our share of those requirements; (e) expectations regarding revenues from space and defense applications, including whether certain programs might be curtailed or discontinued; (f) expectations regarding sales for industrial applications; (g) expectations regarding cash generation, working capital trends, and inventory levels; (h) expectations as to the level of capital expenditures, capacity, including the timing of completion of capacity expansions, and qualification of new products; (i) expectations regarding our ability to improve or maintain margins; (j) expectations regarding our ability to attract, motivate, and retain the workforce necessary to execute our business strategy; (k) projections regarding our tax rate; (l) expectations with regard to the continued impact of macroeconomic factors or geopolitical issues or conflicts; (m) expectations regarding our strategic initiatives, including our sustainability goals; (n) expectations with regard to the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures; (o) expectations regarding the outcome of legal matters or the impact of changes in laws or regulations; and (p) our expectations of financial results for 2024 and beyond . 
 Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, that may cause actual results to be materially different. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the extent of the impact of macroeconomic factors or geopolitical issues or conflicts; reductions in sales to any significant customers, particularly Airbus or Boeing, including related to regulatory activity or public scrutiny impacting the Boeing 737 MAX or the Boeing 787; our ability to effectively adjust production and inventory levels to align with customer demand; our ability to effectively motivate, retain and hire the necessary workforce; the availability and cost of raw materials, including the impact of supply disruptions and inflation; our ability to successfully implement or realize our strategic initiatives, including our sustainability goals and any restructuring or alignment activities in which we may engage; changes in sales mix; changes in current pricing due to cost levels; changes in aerospace delivery rates; changes in government defense procurement budgets; timely new product development or introduction; our ability to install, staff and qualify necessary capacity or complete capacity expansions to meet customer demand; cybersecurity-related risks, including the potential impact of breaches or intrusions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; changes in political, social and economic conditions, including the effect of change in global trade policies, such as sanctions; work stoppages or other labor disruptions; our ability to successfully complete any strategic acquisitions, investments or dispositions; compliance with environmental, health, safety and other related laws and regulations, including those related to climate change; the effects of natural disasters or other severe weather events, which may be worsened by the impact of climate change, and other severe catastrophic events, including any public health crisis; and the unexpected outcome of legal matters or impact of changes in laws or regulations . 
 Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. As a result, the foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with other cautionary statements included in this and other reports we file with the SEC. For additional information regarding certain factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those expected or anticipated, see the information under the caption Risk Factors, which is located in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31. 2023.
