 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Note 1. 
 capacities is done in accordance with a subscriber's agreement (a limited power of attorney) executed individually by each subscriber (policyholder), which appoints Indemnity as each subscriber's attorney-in-fact to transact certain business on their behalf. In accordance with the subscriber's agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these capacities, we retain a management fee calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange. 
 
 The policy issuance and renewal services we provide on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies. The sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services. Agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as incentive compensation, which is earned by achieving targeted measures. The underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing. The remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support. We also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above. Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions. 
 
 Consistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers. Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact. Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement. The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity. Claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions. Life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business. Investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds. Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions. The subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to Indemnity. Reimbursements are settled at cost. State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department. 
 
 Our results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the Exchange. If any events occurred that impaired the Exchange s ability to grow or sustain its financial condition, including but not limited to reduced financial strength ratings, disruption in the independent agency relationships, significant catastrophe losses or products not meeting customer demands, the Exchange could find it more difficult to retain its existing business and attract new business. A decline in the business of the Exchange almost certainly could have as a consequence a decline in the total premiums paid and a correspondingly adverse effect on the amount of the management fees we receive. We also have an exposure to a concentration of credit risk related to the unsecured receivables due from the Exchange for net management fee and other reimbursements. See Note 12, "Concentrations of Credit Risk".

 of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintained at a level greater than or equal to for the duration of the loan. We monitor the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and obtain additional collateral as necessary. A securities lending transaction may be terminated at any time by the borrower or the lender. If terminated, we would repay our securities lending obligations from the sale of reinvested collateral or the proceeds of sales from our investment portfolio, which includes liquid securities.

 , of all direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange. We allocate a portion of our management fee revenue, currently of the direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange, between the performance obligations we have under the subscriber s agreement. The first performance obligation is to provide policy issuance and renewal services to the subscribers (policyholders) at the Exchange, and the second is to act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange, as well as the service provider for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services. 
 
 The transaction price, including management fee revenue and administrative services reimbursement revenue, includes variable consideration and is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services. A constraining estimate of variable consideration exists related to the potential for management fees to be returned if a policy were to be cancelled mid-term. Management fees are returned to the Exchange when policyholders cancel their insurance coverage mid-term and premiums are refunded to them. The constraining estimate is determined using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. The estimated transaction price, as reduced by the constraint, reflects consideration expected for performance of our services. We update the transaction price and the related allocation at least annually based upon the most recent information available or more frequently if there have been significant changes in any components considered in the transaction price. 
 
 The first performance obligation is to provide policy issuance and renewal services that result in executed insurance policies between the Exchange or one of its insurance subsidiaries and the subscriber (policyholder). The subscriber (policyholder) receives economic benefits when substantially all the policy issuance or renewal services are complete and an insurance policy is issued or renewed by the Exchange or one of its insurance subsidiaries. It is at the time of policy issuance or renewal that the allocated portion of revenue is recognized. 
 
 period representing the time over which these services are provided. The portion of revenue not yet earned is recorded as a contract liability in the Statements of Financial Position. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2022.

 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of loaned securities, comprised of corporate debt securities, was million and the related collateral received was million. We received cash collateral of million, which was reinvested in cash equivalents and is included with "Cash and cash equivalents" in our Statement of Financial Position. We also received million of non-cash collateral that we are not permitted to sell or repledge, and there are no securities lending transactions that extend beyond one year from the reporting date. 
 
 If we have to return cash collateral on short notice, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale, for securities in an unrealized loss position, realized losses would be incurred on securities sold and impairments would be incurred, if there is a need to sell securities prior to recovery, which may negatively impact our financial condition.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND DISCLOSURE RULES 
 
 See Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Financial Statements" contained within this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and disclosure rules, and the impact on our financial statements if known. 

OPERATING OVERVIEW 
 
 Overview 
 We serve as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the Exchange, a reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance. Our primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange. We also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange, as well as the service provider for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services. 
 
 The Exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange, which is an unincorporated association of individuals, partnerships and corporations that agree to insure one another. Each applicant for insurance (a subscriber) to the Exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of Indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the Exchange on their behalf. In accordance with the subscriber s agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we retain a management fee calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange. 
 
 Our earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange. The policy issuance and renewal services we provide are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies. The sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services. Agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as incentive compensation, which is earned by achieving targeted measures. Agent compensation generally comprises approximately two-thirds of our policy issuance and renewal expenses. The underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing. The remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support. We also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above. Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions. 
 
 Consistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers. Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact. Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement. The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity. Claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions. Life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business. Investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds. In 2023, approximately 71 of the administrative services expenses were entirely attributable to the respective administrative functions (claims handling, life insurance management and investment management), while the remaining 29 of these expenses were allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions. The expenses we incur and related reimbursements we receive for administrative services are presented gross in our Statements of Operations. The subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to Indemnity. Reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis. State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department. 
 
 Our results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the Exchange as the Exchange is our sole customer, and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange. The Exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 70 of the 2023 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 30 . The principal

 personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners. The principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.

Operating income increased in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, as growth in operating revenue outpaced the growth in operating expenses. Management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased 18.5 to 769.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 19.3 to 2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Management fee revenue is based upon the management fee rate we charge and the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange. The management fee rate was 25 for both 2024 and 2023. The direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange increased 18.4 to 3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and 19.1 to 9.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 17.1 to 613.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 16.1 to 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher scheduled commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, as well as increased personnel costs, agent incentive compensation and underwriting report costs, partially offset by decreased professional fees. 
 
 Management fee revenue for administrative services increased 6.2 to 17.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 8.9 to 51.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations increased both total operating revenue and total operating expenses by 206.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 604.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, but had no net impact on operating income. 
 
 Total investment income increased 7.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 29.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The results from both periods were primarily due to an increase in net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains in 2024 compared to net losses in 2023. 
 
 General Conditions and Trends Affecting Our Business 
 Economic conditions 
 Unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the Exchange s customers to modify coverage, not renew policies or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the Exchange, and consequently our management fee revenue. Elevated inflation or supply chain disruptions could impact the Exchange's operations and our management fees. In particular, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, building material cost inflation, auto repair and replacement cost inflation and social inflation may impact adequacy of estimated loss reserves and future premium rates of the Exchange. If any of these items impacted the financial condition or operations of the Exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results. See Financial Condition and Liquidity and Capital Resources contained within this report, as well as Part I. Item 1A. "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024 for a discussion of the potential impacts to our operations or those of the Exchange.

 Financial market volatility 
 Our portfolio of fixed maturity and equity security investments is subject to market volatility, especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets. Over time, net investment income is impacted by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations. Depending upon market conditions, considerable fluctuation could occur in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Various ongoing geopolitical events, the uncertain inflationary environment and a potential economic slowdown could have a significant impact on the global financial markets with the potential for future losses and/or impairments on our investment portfolio.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Management fee revenue 
 We have two performance obligations in the subscriber s agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange, as well as the service provider for the Exchange's insurance subsidiaries with respect to all administrative services. We retain a management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange in these two capacities, and allocate our revenues between our performance obligations. 
 
 The management fee is calculated by multiplying all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange by the management fee rate, which is determined by our Board of Directors at least annually. The management fee rate was set at 25 for both 2024 and 2023. Changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly. The transaction price, including management fee revenue and administrative services reimbursement revenue, includes variable consideration and is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services. We update the transaction price and the related allocation at least annually based upon the most recent information available or more frequently if there have been significant changes in any components considered in the transaction price. Our current transaction price allocation review resulted in a minor change in the allocation between the two performance obligations in 2024 compared to prior years, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 
 The following table presents the allocation and disaggregation of revenue for our two performance obligations:

 (1) A constraining estimate of variable consideration exists related to the potential for management fees to be returned if a policy were to be cancelled mid-term. Management fees are returned to the Exchange when policies are cancelled mid-term and unearned premiums are refunded. 
 (2) Management fee revenue - administrative services is recognized over time as the services are provided. See Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements - Note 3, Revenue, of Notes to Financial Statements" contained within this report.

 Direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange 
 Direct and affiliated assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the Exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries. Direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange increased 18.4 to 3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by increased personal lines and commercial multi-peril premiums written. Year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased 6.0 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 6.1 in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 12.8 at September 30, 2024 compared to 8.7 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Premiums generated from new business increased 9.5 to 441 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by increased premiums written in the commercial multi-peril and homeowners lines. Contributing to this change was a 15.9 increase in year-over-year average premium per policy on new business, somewhat offset by a 4.0 decrease in new business policies written in the third quarter of 2024. Premiums generated from new business increased 39.7 to 403 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily driven by increased premiums written in the personal auto, commercial multi-peril and homeowners lines. Contributing to this change was a 21.3 increase in new business policies written and a 12.1 increase in year-over-year average premium per policy on new business at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Premiums generated from renewal business increased 20.0 to 2.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased 14.4 to 2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Underlying the trend in renewal business premiums in both periods was an 12.3 increase in year-over-year average premium per policy at September 30, 2024, and 8.1 at September 30, 2023, as well as an increase in year-over-year policies in force of 5.7 and 4.2 in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Personal lines Total personal lines premiums written increased 20.1 to 2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 19.6 in the third quarter of 2023, driven by a 14.7 increase in total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 6.2 increase in total personal lines policies in force. 
 
 Commercial lines Total commercial lines premiums written increased 13.9 to 828 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 12.4 in the third quarter of 2023, driven by a 9.3 increase in total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 4.8 increase in total commercial lines policies in force. 
 
 Future trends-premium revenue Through a careful agency selection and monitoring process, the Exchange plans to continue efforts to utilize its agency force to increase market penetration in existing operating territories to contribute to future growth. 
 
 Changes in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force and rate changes affect the profitability of the Exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee revenue. Future premiums could be impacted by potential changes in regulation and inflationary trends, among others. The Exchange's pricing actions taken in 2023 have contributed to its increased average premium per policy at September 30, 2024. See also Part I. Item 1A. "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024.

Policy issuance and renewal services 
 The management fee revenue allocated for providing policy issuance and renewal services was 24.40 and 24.30 of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue when the policy is issued or renewed because it is at that time that the services we provide are substantially complete and the executed insurance policy is transferred to the customer. The increase in management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services was driven by the increase in the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange discussed previously. 
 
 Service agreement revenue 
 Service agreement revenue primarily consists of service charges we collect from subscribers/policyholders for providing multiple payment plans on policies written by the Exchange and its property and casualty subsidiaries and also includes late payment and policy reinstatement fees. The service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment. Service agreement revenue also includes fees received from the Exchange for the use of shared office space.

Commissions Commissions increased 66.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 202.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by the growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium and, to a lesser extent, an increase in agent incentive compensation related to the profitability component. The estimated agent incentive payouts at September 30, 2024 are based on actual underwriting results for the two prior years and current year-to-date actual results and forecasted results for the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Non-commission expense Non-commission expense increased 23.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Underwriting and policy processing expense increased 5.1 million primarily due to increased underwriting report and personnel costs. Information technology costs increased 3.6 million primarily due to an increase in hardware and software costs and personnel costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. Sales and advertising expense increased 4.4 million primarily due to increased costs from community development initiatives and agent-related costs. Administrative and other costs increased 7.6 million primarily due to increased personnel costs.

Table of Contents 

 Non-commission expense increased 41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Underwriting and policy processing expense increased 13.7 million primarily due to increased underwriting report and personnel costs. Information technology costs decreased 3.9 million primarily due to a decrease in professional fees, partially offset by an increase in hardware and software costs. Sales and advertising expense increased 9.6 million primarily due to increased agent-related costs and costs from community development initiatives. Customer service costs increased 6.7 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and credit card processing fees. Administrative and other costs increased 15.6 million primarily due to increased personnel costs, professional fees and charitable contributions. 
 
 Personnel costs in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by increased compensation including higher estimated costs for incentive plan awards compared to 2023. Increases in incentive plan costs in both periods were primarily driven by a higher company stock price at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023.

We also report reimbursed costs as revenues, which are recognized monthly as services are provided. The administrative services expenses we incur and the related reimbursements we receive are recorded gross in the Statements of Operations. 
 
 Cost of administrative services 
 Consistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers. Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact. Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at Exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement. The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity. The subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to Indemnity. Reimbursements due from the Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries are recorded as a receivable and settled at cost.

 NM = not meaningful 

Net investment income 
 Net investment income includes interest and dividends on our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios and the results of our limited partnership investments, net of investment expenses. Net investment income increased 2.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in bond and cash and cash equivalent income driven by higher bond yields and higher average holdings. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher equity in earnings of limited partnerships and an increase in bond income driven by higher yields and average holdings. Net investment income included 0.1 million of limited partnership losses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to losses of less than 0.1 million for the same period in 2023, and 0.1 million of limited partnership earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to losses of 10.7 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) 
 A breakdown of our net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) is as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Securities sold: (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Available-for-sale securities 142 (2,480) (2,495) (6,195) Equity securities 146 91 883 (2,636) Change in fair value on remaining equity securities 2,636 153 4,594 (424) Miscellaneous 1 9 1 9 Net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) 2,925 (2,227) 2,983 (9,246) 

Net realized and unrealized gains of 2.9 million during the third quarter of 2024 were primarily due to market value adjustments in the preferred stock portfolio. Net realized and unrealized gains of 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to market value adjustments in the preferred stock portfolio, partially offset by losses on disposals of available-for-sale securities. Net realized and unrealized losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale securities. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included disposals of equity securities impacted by banking industry events. 
 
 Net impairment losses recognized in earnings 
 Net impairment losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included both intent to sell and credit-related impairments on available-for-sale securities as well as current expected credit losses on agent loans and other loans receivable. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included current expected credit losses recognized on held-to-maturity securities of 2.2 million. See "Other assets" in Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Financial Statements" for additional information.

 Financial Condition of Erie Insurance Exchange 
 Serving in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange, we are dependent on the growth and financial condition of the Exchange, who is our sole customer. The strength of the Exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by A.M. Best through assessing its financial stability and ability to pay claims. The ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors. The Exchange and each of its property and casualty subsidiaries are rated A+ "Superior", the second highest financial strength rating, which is assigned to companies that have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by A.M. Best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term. As of December 31, 2023, only approximately 12 of insurance groups, in which the Exchange is included, are rated A+ or higher. On August 8, 2024, while our A+ "Superior" rating was reaffirmed, the financial strength rating outlook was revised from stable to negative. The outlook was primarily driven by the Exchange s recent profitability challenges from rising loss cost pressures and increased weather-related activity, and the related surplus impact. The outlook acknowledged that while actions have been implemented to address the challenges, the timing lag related to the most significant action, rate increases, could result in interim challenges until such time as the rate increases are earned and the full beneficial impact is realized. 
 
 The financial statements of the Exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Statutory direct written premiums of the Exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries grew 19.1 to 9.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. These premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the Exchange. Policyholders surplus determined under statutory accounting principles was 9.2 billion and 9.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 90.8 at September 30, 2024 and 91.2 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 We have prepared our financial statements considering the financial strength of the Exchange based on its A.M. Best rating and strong level of surplus. See Part I. Item 1A. "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024 for possible outcomes that could impact that determination.

This investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule. Our fixed maturity portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk. 
 
 Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders equity.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We continue to monitor the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources given the potential impact of current economic conditions, including the uncertain inflationary and interest rate environment. While we did not see a significant impact on our sources or uses of cash in the first nine months of 2024, future market disruptions could occur which may affect our liquidity position. If our normal operating and investing cash activities were to become insufficient to meet future funding requirements, we believe we have sufficient access to liquidity through our cash position, diverse liquid marketable securities and our 100 million bank revolving line of credit that does not expire until October 2026. See broader discussions of potential risks to our operations in the Operating Overview contained within this report and Part I. Item 1A. "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs. Our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, the purchase and development of information technology and other capital expenditures. See Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements - Note 8, Postretirement Benefits, of Notes to Financial Statements" contained within this report for the funding policy and related contribution for our defined benefit pension plan. We expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations. Cash in excess of our operating needs is primarily invested in investment grade fixed maturities. As part of our liquidity review, we regularly evaluate our capital needs based on current and projected results and consider the potential impacts to our liquidity, borrowing capacity, financial covenants and capital availability. 
 
 We maintain relationships and cash balances at diversified and well-capitalized financial institutions and have established processes to monitor them. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our current and future cash requirements. 
 
 Volatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we do occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash. Some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, may be illiquid. Additionally, if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements, or if we are required to return cash collateral in connection with our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, or be forced to sell at deep discounts. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from sources other than the liquidation of securities.

 Cash flow activities 
 The following table provides condensed cash flow information as follows for the nine months ended September 30: 
 (in thousands) 2024 2023 (Unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities 417,791 232,769 Net cash used in investing activities (170,406) (105,730) Net cash used in financing activities (170,227) (166,256) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 77,158 (39,217) 

Net cash provided by operating activities was 417.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 232.8 million for the same period in 2023. Increased cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in management fees received of 362.6 million driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange, a decrease in pension and employee benefits paid of 60.8 million due to lower pension contributions, and a decrease in incentive compensation paid to agents of 24.7 million. Pension contributions totaled 33.0 million in 2024 compared to 95.0 million in 2023. Partially offsetting the increased cash provided by operating activities was an increase in cash paid for agent commissions of 178.5 million driven by premium growth and income taxes paid of 55.5 million. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 170.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 105.7 million for the same period in 2023. Increased cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities of 166.8 million and loans to agents and others of 26.8 million, partially offset by an increase in sales and 
 maturities/calls of available-for-sale securities of 126.4 million. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 170.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 166.3 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to dividends paid to shareholders. We increased both our Class A and Class B shareholder regular quarterly dividends by 7.1 for 2024, compared to 2023. There are no regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to our shareholders. 
 
 Capital Outlook 
 We regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events, including under current inflationary conditions and a higher interest rate environment. Should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us. 
 
 Outside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through: 1) unrestricted and unpledged cash and cash equivalents, which totaled approximately 195.5 million at September 30, 2024, 2) 100 million available bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of unrestricted and unpledged assets held in our investment portfolio, including equity securities and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately 863.7 million at September 30, 2024. Volatility in the financial markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts. Additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have access to a 100 million bank revolving line of credit. See Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements - Note 7, Bank Line of Credit, of Notes to Financial Statements" contained within this report for additional information. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees. See Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements - Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to Financial Statements" contained within this report for additional information. We do not believe that these obligations will have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 We make estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements. The most significant estimates relate to investment valuation and retirement benefit plans for employees. While management believes its estimates are appropriate, the ultimate amounts may differ from estimates provided. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in Item 7. "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for the year ended December 31, 2023 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024. See Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements - Note 5, Fair Value, of Notes to Financial Statements" contained within this report for additional information on our valuation of investments. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Our exposure to market risk is primarily related to fluctuations in interest rates and prices. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk resulting from changes in interest rates, prices and other risk exposures for the year ended December 31, 2023 are included in Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024. 
 
 The current inflationary environment, ongoing geopolitical risks and a potential economic slowdown may create future volatility; however, there have been no material changes that impacted our portfolio or reshaped our periodic investment reviews of asset allocations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We continue to closely monitor the economic environment and financial markets and will take appropriate measures, when necessary, to minimize potential risk exposure to our cash and investment balances. For a recent discussion of conditions surrounding our investment portfolio, see the "Operating Overview", "Results of Operations" and "Financial Condition" discussions contained in Part I, Item 2. "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained within this report. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 Our management evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, any change in our internal control over financial reporting and determined there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Erie Indemnity Company ("Indemnity") was named as a defendant in a complaint filed on August 24, 2021, by alleged subscribers of the Erie Insurance Exchange (the "Exchange") in the Court of Common Pleas Civil Division of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania captioned TROY STEPHENSON, CHRISTINA STEPHENSON, SUSAN RUBEL and STEVEN BARNETT, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated (Plaintiffs) v. Erie Indemnity Company (Defendant). 
 
 The complaint seeks relief for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by Indemnity in connection with the setting of the management fee it receives, in accordance with the terms of the Subscribers Agreement executed between Indemnity and all policyholders of the Exchange, as compensation for acting as the attorney-in-fact in the management of the Exchange. The relief sought is for the period beginning two years prior to the date of the filing of the complaint and continuing through 2021. 
 
 The complaint seeks (i) a finding that Indemnity has breached its fiduciary duties; (ii) an award of damages in an amount to be determined at trial; and (iii) such other relief, including disgorgement of profits or other injunctive relief, that the Court deems just and proper. 
 
 Service of the complaint was effectuated on September 20, 2021. A Notice of Removal to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania was filed on October 20, 2021. On November 2, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. As a result, the action was dismissed without prejudice. 
 
 On December 6, 2021, another Complaint was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania captioned ERIE INSURANCE EXCHANGE, an unincorporated association, by TROY STEPHENSON, CHRISTINA STEPHENSON and STEVEN BARNETT, trustees ad litem, and alternatively, ERIE INSURANCE EXCHANGE, by TROY STEPHENSON, CHRISTINA STEPHENSON and STEVEN BARNETT, (Plaintiff), v. ERIE INDEMNITY COMPANY, (Defendant). 
 
 This most recent complaint has the same allegation of breach of fiduciary duty by Indemnity in connection with the setting of the management fee it receives, in accordance with the terms of the Subscribers Agreement executed between Indemnity and all policyholders of the Exchange, as compensation for acting as the attorney-in-fact in the management of the Exchange. 
 
 This most recent complaint seeks the same relief, specifically, (i) a finding that Indemnity has breached its fiduciary duties; (ii) an award of damages in an amount to be determined at trial; and (iii) such other relief, including disgorgement of profits or other injunctive relief, that the Court deems just and proper. 
 
 A Notice of Removal to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania was filed on January 27, 2022. Indemnity intends to vigorously defend against all of the allegations and requests for relief in the complaint. 
 
 By Memorandum Opinion and Order dated September 28, 2022, the Court granted the Motion for Remand and directed the case be remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. On September 30, 2022, Indemnity filed a Motion to Stay the Remand Order pending an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On October 3, 2022, the Court granted the Stay. On October 11, 2022, Indemnity filed a Petition for Permission to Appeal the Remand Order with the Third Circuit. By Order dated November 7, 2022, a three judge panel of the Court denied the Petition to Appeal. 
 
 On November 21, 2022, Indemnity filed a Petition for Rehearing requesting that the Third Circuit permit the appeal. By Order dated January 9, 2023, the Court granted the petition for rehearing and vacated the prior Order of October 7, 2022, denying permission to appeal. On April 20, 2023, argument was held before a three-judge panel of the Third Circuit. By Opinion dated May 22, 2023, the Court affirmed the decision of the District Court finding that there was no basis for federal court jurisdiction and that the matter had been properly remanded to state court. On June 5, 2023, Indemnity filed a Petition for Panel Rehearing or Rehearing En Banc. By Order dated June 22, 2023, the Court denied the Petition. The United States District Court thereafter extended its stay of the issuance of the remand order through the conclusion of any proceedings in the United States Supreme Court challenging the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that no federal jurisdiction exists in this case. 
 
 On October 20, 2023, Indemnity filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States. The Petition sought a determination from the Court that the lower courts improperly denied federal jurisdiction. By order dated February 26, 2024, the United States Supreme Court denied Indemnity's Petition for Writ of Certiorari.

Table of Contents 

 Separately, Indemnity filed a Complaint in Federal Court to invoke certain provisions of the All Writs Act and the Anti-Injunction Act. By filing this complaint, Indemnity seeks to protect the federal court s prior binding, final judgments in favor of Indemnity and thereby foreclose further litigation of the claims and issues pertaining to the compensation practices that were the subject of the prior judgments. After the denial of certiorari, the district court, by Opinion and Order dated February 28, 2024, granted Indemnity s motion for a preliminary injunction under the All Writs Act after determining that the gravamen of the plaintiff s state court action is the same as two actions previously dismissed in federal court, that Indemnity would be irreparably harmed if it is forced to relitigate those same issues in state court, plaintiffs had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the same issues in prior litigation, and that an injunction would serve the public interest. The Court s order preliminarily enjoined the named plaintiffs from pursuing the Erie Ins. Exch. v. Erie Indem. Co. action and enjoined the state court from conducting further proceedings in that action. The court ordered Indemnity to file a motion to convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction. In the meantime, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. As a result of the filing of the appeal, the trial court stayed the order issuing an injunction. 
 
 The appeal has been briefed and awaiting further action by the Third Circuit. Oral argument on the appeal was held on October 29, 2024, before a three-judge panel of the Third Circuit. 
 
 Indemnity intends to vigorously defend the district court s order on appeal and to otherwise defend against all allegations and requests for relief sought by plaintiffs.
