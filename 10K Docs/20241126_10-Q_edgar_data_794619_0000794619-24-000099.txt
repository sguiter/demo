 (Unaudited) 
 
 Note A-- 
 impairment charges related to goodwill for the three- and six-month periods ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangibles. The Company amortizes the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, , unless such lives are deemed indefinite. The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. There were impairment charges related to intangible assets for the three- and six-month periods ended October 31, 2023. Customer relationship intangibles were fully amortized as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company uses derivatives as part of the normal business operations to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates associated with variable interest rate debt and foreign exchange rates. The Company has established policies and procedures that govern the risk management of these exposures. The primary objective in managing these exposures is to add stability to interest expense, manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements, and manage the risk from adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
 
 The Company uses interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposures. The Company records outstanding swap contracts in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. If a derivative is deemed to be ineffective, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. 
 
 The Company also manages risks through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company recognizes its outstanding forward contracts in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Company does not designate the forward contracts as accounting hedges. The changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded in other expense (income), net in the condensed consolidated statements of income.

 There were potentially dilutive securities for the three- and six-month periods ended October 31, 2024, which were excluded from the calculation of net earnings per diluted share. Potentially dilutive securities of and for the three- and six-month periods ended October 31, 2023, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of net earnings per diluted share as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, was outstanding under the Revolving Facility or the revolving facility available under the prior credit agreement, as applicable. Outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Facility were million as of October 31, 2024, leaving approximately million in available capacity under the Revolving Facility as of October 31, 2024. The outstanding balances noted above approximate fair value as the facilities under the A R Credit Facility have, and the facilities under the prior credit agreement had, a floating interest rate. 
 
 Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility bear interest based on a fluctuating rate measured by reference to either, at the Company's option, a base rate plus an applicable margin or Term SOFR (as defined in the A R Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin, with the applicable margin being determined by reference to the Company's then-current Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the A R Credit Agreement). The Company also incurs a quarterly commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Facility during the applicable quarter at a rate per annum also determined by reference to the Company's then-current Secured Net Leverage Ratio. In addition, a letter of credit fee accrues on the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit at a per annum rate equal to the applicable margin on Term SOFR loans, payable quarterly in arrears. As of October 31, 2024, the applicable margin with respect to base rate loans and Term SOFR loans was and , respectively, and the commitment fee was . 
 
 The A R Credit Agreement includes certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain (i) a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the A R Credit Agreement) of no less than to 1.00 and (ii) a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the A R Credit Agreement) of no greater than to 1.00, subject, in each case, to certain limited exceptions. 
 
 The A R Credit Agreement includes certain additional covenants, including negative covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create additional liens on its assets, make certain investments, dispose of its assets, or engage in a merger or other similar transaction, or engage in transactions with affiliates, subject, in each case, to the various exceptions and conditions described in the A R Credit Agreement. The negative covenants further restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to make certain restricted payments, including, in the case of the Company, the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock, in certain limited circumstances. 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants included in the A R Credit Agreement.

 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million to hedge part of the variable rate interest payments under the Term Loan Facility. The interest rate swaps became effective on May 28, 2021 and will terminate on May 30, 2025. The interest rate swaps economically convert a portion of the variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The Company receives floating interest payments monthly based on one-month SOFR and pays a fixed rate of to the counterparty. 
 
 The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value are recorded to other comprehensive income. The risk management objective in using interest rate swaps is to add stability to interest expense and to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the contract agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Realized gains or losses in connection with required interest payments on interest rate swaps are recorded in earnings, as a component of interest expense, net to offset variability in interest expense associated with the underlying debt's cash flows. 
 
 For the three- and six-month periods ended October 31, 2024, unrealized gains (losses), net of deferred taxes, of million and million, respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income, and million and million, respectively, of realized gains, net of deferred taxes, were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense, net due to interest received from and payments made to the swap counterparties. For the three- and six-month periods ended October 31, 2023, unrealized gains (losses), net of deferred taxes, of million and million, respectively, were recorded in other comprehensive income, and million and million, respectively, of realized gains, net of deferred taxes, were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense, net due to interest received from and payments made to the swap counterparties. As of October 31, 2024, the Company anticipates reclassifying approximately million of net hedging gains from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings during the next 12 months to offset the variability of the hedged items during this period.

defined fixings. These fixings allow for U.S. dollars to be converted into Pesos at a rate of Pesos to one U.S. Dollar.

 The inflation rate as of October 2024 was 2.6 , compared to 3.2 in October 2023 and 3.4 in April 2024 according to data provided by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
 
 The Company believes there is no single indicator that directly correlates with cabinet remodeling market activity. For this reason, the Company considers other factors in addition to those discussed above as indicators of overall market activity including credit availability, home owner equity, and housing affordability. 
 
 The Company earned net income of 27.7 million, or 6.1 of net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with 30.3 million, or 6.4 of net sales, in the same period of the prior year and earned net income of 57.3 million, or 6.3 of net sales, for the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with 68.2 million, or 7.0 of net sales, in the same period of the prior year.

 Net Sales 
 
 20 

Net sales were 452.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of 21.4 million or 4.5 compared to the same period of fiscal 2024. For the first half of fiscal 2025, net sales were 911.6 million, reflecting a 60.5 million or 6.2 decrease compared to the same period of fiscal 2024. The Company's remodeling sales, which consist of our independent dealer and distributor channel sales and home center retail sales, decreased 7.1 during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 11.5 during the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared to the same prior year period. Our independent dealer and distributor channel decreased 3.0 during the second quarter and 8.5 during the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the comparable prior year periods. Our home center channel decreased by 8.6 during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 12.7 during the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2024. Demand trends remain under pressure for our made-to-order and stock kitchen business due to lower in-store traffic rates and consumers choosing smaller sized projects. 
 
 Builder sales decreased 1.2 in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and increased 1.0 during the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2024. The Company believes that fluctuations in single-family housing starts and completions are the best indicator of new construction cabinet activity. Assuming a sixty to ninety day lag between housing starts and the installation of cabinetry, single-family housing starts decreased 1.0 during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 over the comparable prior year period, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. In comparison, housing completions increased 3.3 during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 over the comparable prior year period, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 18.9 compared with 21.8 for the same period of fiscal 2024, representing a 290 basis point decrease. Gross profit margin for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 19.6 compared with 21.9 for the same period of fiscal 2024, representing a 230 basis point decrease. Gross profit margin in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 was negatively impacted by lower sales volumes impacting manufacturing leverage combined with price increases in our input costs around logistics, raw materials, and labor, partially offset by our sustained operating efficiencies in the manufacturing platforms. 
 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 
 Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 0.9 million or 4.2 during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 1.0 million or 2.1 during the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same period of the prior year. Selling and marketing expenses were 4.8 of net sales in both the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and 2024. Selling and marketing expenses were 5.1 of net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with 4.8 for the same period of fiscal 2024. The increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percent of net sales during the first half of fiscal 2025 was driven primarily by lower net sales, and partially offset by lower incentive costs for employees. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 14.8 million or 42.2 during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 28.9 million or 40.9 during the first half of fiscal 2025, compared to the same periods of the prior year. General and administrative expenses were 4.5 of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with 7.4 of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. General and administrative expenses were 4.6 of net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with 7.3 for the same period of fiscal 2024. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 was driven primarily by the absence of amortization of customer intangibles that ended in December 2023 and lower year-over-year incentive and profit sharing costs for employees. 
 
 Effective Income Tax Rates 
 
 The effective income tax rates for the three- and six-month period ended October 31, 2024 was 21.9 and 23.5 compared with 25.0 and 23.3 , respectively, in the comparable periods in the prior fiscal year. The effective rates were higher than the 21.0 U.S. statutory rate for all periods presented primarily due to state income taxes. The effective rate for the three-month period ended October 31, 2024 was lower than the comparable prior year period primarily due to the benefit recognized from the purchase of third party federal tax credits and stock compensation deductions booked in the current period. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We have reported our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. 
 21 

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is set forth below. 
 
 Management believes all these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period's results against the corresponding prior period's results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
 
 We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in evaluating the performance of our business, and we use each in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and as indicators of business performance and profitability. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin allow us to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used in our Term Loans to determine interest rates and financial covenant compliance. 
 
 We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude (1) income tax expense (benefit), (2) interest expense, net, (3) depreciation and amortization expense, and (4) amortization of customer relationship intangibles. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude (1) expenses related to the acquisition of RSI Home Products, Inc. ("RSI acquisition"), (2) restructuring charges, net, (3) net gain/loss on debt modification, (4) stock-based compensation expense, (5) gain/loss on asset disposals, and (6) change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, is useful for investors because management uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the performance of our business. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. 
 
 Adjusted EPS per diluted share 
 
 We use Adjusted EPS per diluted share in evaluating the performance of our business and profitability. Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing the Company's results by providing an indication of performance and profitability excluding the impact of unusual and/or non-cash items. We define Adjusted EPS per diluted share as diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impact of (1) expenses related to the RSI acquisition, (2) restructuring charges, net (3) the amortization of customer relationship intangibles, (4) net gain/loss on debt modification, (5) change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, and (6) the tax benefit of RSI acquisition expenses, restructuring charges, the net gain/loss on debt modification, the amortization of customer relationship intangibles, and the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts. The amortization of intangible assets is driven by the RSI acquisition. Management has determined that excluding amortization of intangible assets and change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts from our definition of Adjusted EPS per diluted share will better help it evaluate the performance of our business and profitability. 
 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company changed its definition of Adjusted EPS per diluted share to exclude the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts to be consistent with its definition of Adjusted EBITDA.

 (1) Acquisition related expenses are comprised of expenses related to the RSI acquisition. 
 (2) Restructuring charges, net are comprised of expenses incurred related to the nationwide reduction-in-force implemented in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 and the reduction in force implemented in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 (3) In the normal course of business the Company is subject to risk from adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company manages these risks through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. The changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded in other (income) expense, net in the operating results. 
 
 A reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as projected for fiscal 2025 is not provided because we do not forecast net income (loss) as we cannot, without unreasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty various components of net income (loss). 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 60.2 million or 13.3 of net sales compared to 72.3 million or 15.3 of net sales for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 123.1 million or 13.5 of net sales compared to 147.5 million or 15.2 of net sales for the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 is primarily due to decreased net income and net sales.

 (1) Change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts was excluded from Adjusted EPS per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to be consistent with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 We expect a low single-digit decline in net sales for fiscal 2025 versus fiscal 2024 as a result of a softer repair and remodel market and a decline in larger ticket remodel purchases across retailers, partially offset by an increase in the new construction market. Our outlook for Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025 has been adjusted to a range of 225 million to 235 million. Adjusted EBITDA will be impacted by the manufacturing deleverage due to lower sales. The change in net sales and Adjusted EBITDA is highly dependent upon overall industry, economic growth trends, material constraints, labor impacts, interest rates and consumer behaviors. 
 
 During fiscal 2025, we will continue our investment back into the business by continuing our path for our digital transformation with investments in our cloud-based ERP platform and investing in automation. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchasing, and lastly, with our debt agreement in place and the leverage ratio we wanted to achieve, debt repayments will be deprioritized. 
 
 Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including under "Forward-Looking Statements," and elsewhere in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, including under Item 1A. "Risk Factors," Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk." 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled 56.7 million at October 31, 2024, representing a 30.7 million decrease from its April 30, 2024 levels primarily due to 22.1 million in payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and 56.5 million of stock repurchases partially offset by 52.7 million of cash provided by operations in the first six months of fiscal 2025. Cash provided by operations in the first six months of fiscal 2024 was 143.7 million. The decrease in the Company's cash from operating activities in the current year was driven primarily by a decrease in net income and depreciation and amortization and cash outflows from inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets, accrued compensation and related expenses, and other accrued expenses, partially offset by cash inflows from income taxes and accounts payable. At October 31, 2024, total long-term debt (including current maturities) was 375.8 million. 
 24 

The Company's main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and generally cash generated from its operating activities. The Company can also borrow amounts under the Revolving Facility. 
 
 On October 10, 2024, the Company amended and restated its prior credit agreement. The amended and restated credit agreement (the "A R Credit Agreement") provides for a 500 million revolving loan facility with a 50 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit (the "Revolving Facility") and a 200 million term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility"). Also on October 10, 2024, the Company borrowed the entire 200 million under the Term Loan Facility and approximately 173 million under the Revolving Facility to repay in full the approximately 370 million then outstanding under its prior credit agreement, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related fees and expenses. The Company is required to repay the Term Loan Facility in specified quarterly installments beginning on January 31, 2025. The Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility mature on October 10, 2029. Approximately 313.2 million was available under the Revolving Facility as of October 31, 2024. 
 
 The A R Credit Agreement includes certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain (i) a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the A R Credit Agreement) of no less than 2.00 to 1.00 and (ii) a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the A R Credit Agreement) of no greater than 4.00 to 1.00, subject, in each case, to certain limited exceptions. 
 
 The A R Credit Agreement includes certain additional covenants, including negative covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create additional liens on its assets, make certain investments, dispose of its assets or engage in a merger or other similar transaction or engage in transactions with affiliates, subject, in each case, to the various exceptions and conditions described in the A R Credit Agreement. The negative covenants further restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to make certain restricted payments, including, in the case of the Company, the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock, in certain limited circumstances. See Note K Loans Payable and Long-Term Debt for a discussion of interest rates under the A R Credit Agreement and our compliance with the covenants in the A R Credit Agreement. We expect to remain in compliance with each of the covenants under the A R Credit Agreement during the remainder of fiscal 2025. 
 
 As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 The Company's investing activities primarily consist of investment in property, plant and equipment and promotional displays. Net cash used for investing activities was 22.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared with 33.8 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2024. 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, net cash used by financing activities was 60.8 million, compared with 55.2 million in the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in cash used during the first six months of fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by 56.5 million of common stock repurchases, an increase of 4.4 million over prior year. 
 
 On November 29, 2023 the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 125 million of the Company's outstanding common shares. In conjunction with this authorization the Board of Directors cancelled the remaining 22.1 million that had yet to be repurchased under the 100 million existing authorization from May 25, 2021. The Company repurchased 32.5 million of its common shares during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. As of October 31, 2024, 33.0 million of funds remained available from the amounts authorized by the Board to repurchase the Company's common stock. 
 
 On November 20, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to 125 million of the Company's outstanding common shares. This authorization is in addition to the stock repurchase program authorized on November 29, 2023. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, at prices and on terms the Company deems appropriate and subject to the Company's cash requirements for other purposes, compliance with the covenants under the A R Credit Agreement, and other factors management deems relevant. The authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire a specific number of shares during any period, and the authorization may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Board. Management generally expects to fund any share repurchases using available cash and cash generated from operations. Repurchased shares will become authorized but unissued common shares. 
 
 Cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements, service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2025. 
 
 25 

Seasonal and Inflationary Factors 
 
 Our business has been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in our first and fourth fiscal quarters. General economic forces and changes in our customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years. The costs of the Company's products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations. The Company has generally been able, over time, to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no significant changes to the Company's critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The costs of the Company's products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations. The Company has generally been able, over time, to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases although there may be a lag in the recovery. 
 
 The A R Credit Agreement includes a variable interest rate component. As a result, we are subject to interest rate risk with respect to such floating-rate debt. A 100 basis point increase in the variable interest rate component of our borrowings as of October 31, 2024 would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 2.5 million. See Note K Loans Payable and Long-Term Debt for further discussion. 
 
 In May 2021, we entered into interest rate swaps to hedge approximately 200 million of our variable interest rate debt. See Note L Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. 
 
 The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts principally to offset currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, thereby limiting our exposure to risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the foreign exchange forward contracts correspond to the periods of the transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
 
 The Company does not currently use commodity or similar financial instruments to manage its commodity price risks. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

 (1) Under a stock repurchase authorization approved by its Board on November 29, 2023, the Company was authorized to purchase up to 125 million of the Company's common shares. Management funded these share repurchases using available cash and cash generated from operations. Repurchased shares became authorized but unissued common shares. At October 31, 2024, 33.0 million of funds remained from the amounts authorized by the Board to repurchase the Company's common shares. The Company purchased a total of 348,877 common shares, for an aggregate purchase price of 32.5 million, during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 under the authorization pursuant to a repurchase plan intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 
 On November 20, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to 125 million of the Company's outstanding common shares. This authorization is in addition to the stock repurchase program authorized on November 29, 2023. Any repurchases under the stock repurchase program are subject to market conditions, the Company s cash requirements for other purposes, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and contractual covenants and any other factors management may deem relevant at the time of such repurchases. The Company is not obligated to make any stock repurchases in the future. 

Item 5. Other Information
