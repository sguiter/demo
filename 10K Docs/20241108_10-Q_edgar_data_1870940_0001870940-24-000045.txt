 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 We have made statements in the sections titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and in other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may, might, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue, the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. You are cautioned that there are important risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the projected results, level of activity, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 
 Our future results could be affected by a variety of other factors, including, but not limited to, failure to open and operate new centers in a timely and cost-effective manner; inability to open new centers due to rising interest rates and increased operating expenses due to rising inflation; increased competition in the weight loss and obesity solutions market, including 
 as a result of the recent regulatory approval, increased market acceptance, availability and customer awareness of 
 weight-loss drugs; shortages or quality control issues with third-party manufacturers or suppliers; competition for surgeons; litigation or medical malpractice claims; inability to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information; changes in the laws governing the corporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting; changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and the threat of recession, economic and other conditions of the states and jurisdictions where our facilities are located; and business disruption or other losses from war, pandemic, terrorist acts or political unrest. 
 
 The risk factors discussed in the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other filings we make from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There also may be other risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we are unable to predict at this time. 
 Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date they were made, which are inherently subject to change, and we are under no duty and we assume no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. Given these uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

 and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), respectively, to executive officers and employees under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted and RSUs, respectively. These RSUs are not considered outstanding until vested. These RSUs have a time-based vesting condition. These units will vest 1/3 per year over . Vesting and payment of these RSUs are generally subject to continuing service of the employee or non-employee director over the ratable vesting periods beginning one year from the date of grant to after the date of grant. The fair values of these RSUs were determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the trading date immediately prior to the grant date. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted and performance-based stock units ("PSUs"), respectively, which have market-based vesting conditions. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted and PSUs, respectively, which have market-based vesting conditions. The vesting is based on achievement of a total shareholder return relative to a specified peer group rTSR ). Based on the rTSR, the awards can settle in shares in a range from to . In addition to the achievement of the performance conditions, these PSUs are generally subject to the continuing service of the employee over the ratable vesting period from the earned date continuing through the settlement of the shares. For these PSUs, the shares settle in the first quarter of the year following the year in which the vesting criteria is met. The fair values of PSUs with a market-based vesting condition were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. 
 In connection with the IPO, on November 4, 2021 the Company previously granted PSUs with performance-based vesting conditions to certain employees. The performance-based conditions include PSUs that can vest upon achieving specified stock price performance targets, and the remaining PSUs can vest upon achieving a revenue performance target in any trailing twelve-month period up to December 31, 2024 (the "Revenue Target"). During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company reassessed the probability of achieving the Revenue Target and determined such achievement is improbable based on current facts and circumstances. As a result, the Company recorded a million cumulative reversal of stock compensation expense related to the unvested PSUs attributable to the Revenue Target in the three months ended March 31, 2024. 
 The Company recognized equity-based compensation expense of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in selling, general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K dated February 27, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions. See the section entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the Company, AirSculpt, we, us and our refer to AirSculpt Technologies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and the Professional Associations. 
 
 Overview 
 AirSculpt is an experienced, fast-growing national provider of body contouring procedures delivering a premium consumer experience. We provide custom body contouring using our proprietary AirSculpt method that removes unwanted fat and tightens skin in a minimally invasive procedure, producing dramatic results. We opened new centers in Kansas City, KS in July 2024, Columbus, OH in August 2024, Deerfield, IL and Birmingham, MI in September 2024. We deliver our AirSculpt procedures through a growing nationwide footprint of 31 centers across 20 states, Canada and the United Kingdom as of November 8, 2024. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we performed 3,277 and 10,972 cases, respectively, compared to 3,426 and 11,252 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately 42.5 million and 141.2 million of revenue, respectively, compared to 46.8 million and 148.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. This represents approximately 9 decline in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in prior year and approximately 5 decline in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in prior year.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we define same-center case and revenue growth as the growth in each of our cases and revenue at facilities that were owned and operated during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At facilities that were not owned or operated for the entirety of the prior year period, the current year period has been pro-rated to reflect only growth experienced during the portion of the three months ended September 30, 2024 in which such facilities were owned and operated during the three months ended September 30, 2023. We define same-center facilities and procedure rooms based on if a facility was owned or operated as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we define same-center case and revenue growth as the growth in each of our cases and revenue at facilities that were owned and operated during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At facilities that were not owned or operated for the entirety of the prior year period, the current year period has been pro-rated to reflect only growth experienced during the portion of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in which such facilities were owned and operated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.We define same-center facilities and procedure rooms based on if a facility was owned or operated as of September 30, 2023.

 Our same-store revenue decline is primarily attributed to weaker than expected performance across the broader aesthetics and high-end retail industries. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per Share 
 We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), however, management believes the evaluation of our ongoing operating results may be enhanced by a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss)/income excluding depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, income tax expense, restructuring and related severance costs, loss/(gain) on disposal of long-lived assets, settlement costs for non-recurring litigation, and equity-based compensation. 
 We define Adjusted Net Income as net (loss)/income excluding restructuring and related severance costs, loss/(gain) on disposal of long-lived assets, settlement costs for non-recurring litigation, equity-based compensation and the tax effect of these adjustments. 
 We include Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income because they are important measures on which our management assesses and believes investors should assess our operating performance. We consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income each to be an important measure because they help illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool including: (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not include results from equity-based compensation and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense on our debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool because it does not include results from equity-based compensation. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We define Adjusted Net Income per Share as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted average basic and diluted shares. We included Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Net Income per Share because they are important measures on which our management assesses and believes investors should assess our operating performance. We consider Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Net Income per Share to be important measures because they help illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis.

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our revenue is generated from our patented AirSculpt procedures performed on our patients. We are 100 self-pay and do not accept payments from the U.S. federal government or payer organizations. We assist patients, as needed, by providing third-party financing options to pay for procedures. We have arrangements with various financing companies to facilitate this option. There is a financing transaction fee based on a set percentage of the amount financed. We recognize revenue based on the expected transaction price which is reduced for financing fees. 
 Our policy is to require full payment for services in advance of performing a procedure. Payments received for which services have yet to been performed for all reported periods are included in deferred revenue and patient deposits on our balance sheets. 
 Cost of Service (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
 Cost of service is comprised of all service and product costs related to the delivery of procedures, including but not limited to compensation to our physicians and clinical staff, medical supply costs, and facility-related rent expense. 
 Operating Expense 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative consists of marketing and advertising expenses we incur to market our patented AirSculpt procedures to potential patients and general and administrative costs, including rent for our corporate offices. 
 Selling Expenses 
 Selling expenses consist of advertising costs for social, digital and traditional marketing and sales and marketing personnel. Our advertising costs include both national and site-based advertising used to generate greater awareness and engagement among our current and potential patients. Our advertising costs include social media, digital marketing and traditional advertising. Selling expenses include salaries and commissions for employees engaged in marketing and sales. We define our customer acquisition costs as the total selling expenses per case. 
 We generally expect our selling expenses to increase as we continue to grow our brand and expand our national footprint. We evaluate our selling expense as compared to growth in our sales volume and will invest accordingly to the extent we believe we can increase our growth without materially negatively impacting our Adjusted EBITDA Margins. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, including salaries and related costs (excluding physician and clinical cost included in cost of service and the salaries and commissions of sales and marketing employees), equity-based compensation, technology, operations, finance, legal, corporate office rent and human resources. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase over time due to the additional legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs that we will continue to incur as a public company. We also expect increases from other costs associated with continuing to grow our business. As we continue to expand the number of centers and procedures rooms, we anticipate general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest costs on our outstanding borrowings under our debt.

See Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
 Overview Our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflect the addition of four de novo centers which increased our procedure rooms by eight. 
 Revenue Our revenue decreased 4.2 million, or 9.1 , compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to weaker than expected performance across the broader aesthetics and high-end retail industries. 
 Cost of Service Our cost of services decreased 0.4 million, or 2.3 , compared to the same period in 2023. The percentage decrease in cost of service is driven by the decrease in cases over the same period and offset by increases in nursing and medical supply expenses during the period. Cost of service was 41.8 and 38.8 as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This is primarily due to opening four de novo facilities in the quarter which caused a temporary 1 increase in cost of service as a percentage of revenue over the prior period as these facilities ramp up. The remaining increase was due to the decline in revenue and not being able to leverage certain fixed costs within cost of service like rent and certain nursing costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.5 million, or 1.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase is related to the additional expenses we incurred for marketing and corporate support as we grow our center count through de novo expansion and providing support for our centers. We expect our marketing and corporate support costs to continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we open de novo centers. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was at 59.9 and 53.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase is primarily driven by the decline in revenue and not being able to leverage certain fixed costs within selling, general and administrative costs. 
 Selling expenses consist of advertising costs for social, digital and traditional marketing and sales and marketing personnel. Total selling expenses were approximately 9.6 million and 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our customer acquisition costs were approximately 2,900 and 2,750 per customer in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We intend to continue investing in our sales and marketing

 capabilities as we add new centers. Additionally, selling expenses as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing and scope of our initiatives and the related impact to our revenue. 
 General and administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, including salaries and related costs (excluding physician and clinical cost included in cost of service), equity-based compensation, technology, operations, finance, legal, corporate office rent and human resources. General and administrative expenses were approximately 15.9 million and 15.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased to approximately 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.6 million for the same period in 2023. This increase is the result of having four additional de novo centers during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the 2023 period. 
 Interest Expense, net Interest expense was 1.6 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is due to the voluntary prepayment of 10.0 million of the principal balance of the term loans under the Credit Agreement on September 29, 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate is (13.8) and (89.2) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The main driver of the difference between the effective and statutory rate is non-deductible executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

 Overview Our financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflect the addition of four de novo centers which increased procedure rooms by eight. 
 Revenue Our revenue decreased 7.1 million, or 4.8 , compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to weaker than expected performance across the broader aesthetics and high-end retail industries. 
 Cost of Service Our cost of service decreased 1.5 million, or 2.7 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The percentage decrease in cost of service is driven by the decrease in cases over the same period and partially offset by increases in nursing and rent related to our new facility openings during the period. Cost of service was 38.7 and 37.9 as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This is primarily due to the decline in revenue and not being able to leverage certain fixed costs within cost of service like rent and certain nursing costs.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.3 million, or 1.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is related to a decrease in our equity-based compensation expense (see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion) partially offset by additional expenses we incurred for marketing and corporate support as we grow our center count through de novo expansion and providing support for our centers. We expect our marketing and corporate support costs to continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we open de novo centers. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 53.5 and 51.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Selling expenses consist of advertising costs for social, digital and traditional marketing and sales and marketing personnel. Total selling expenses were approximately 34.0 million and 27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our customer acquisition costs were approximately 3,095 and 2,400 per customer in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We intend to continue investing in our sales and marketing capabilities as we add new centers. Additionally, selling expenses as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing and scope of our initiatives and the related impact to our revenue. 
 General and administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, including salaries and related costs (excluding physician and clinical cost included in cost of service), equity-based compensation, technology, operations, finance, legal, corporate office rent and human resources. General and administrative expense were approximately 41.5 million and 49.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This reduction is due to a decrease in equity-based compensation (see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion). 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased to approximately 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.5 million for the same period in 2023. This increase is the result of having four additional de novo centers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the 2023 period. 
 Interest Expense, net Interest expense decreased to 4.6 million from 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is due to the lower principal balance resulting from the Company's voluntary 10 million prepayment made in 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate is (38.5) and 96.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The main driver of the difference between the effective and statutory rate is non-deductible executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We principally rely on cash flows from operations as our primary source of liquidity and, if needed, up to 5.0 million in revolving loans under our revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are for payroll, marketing and advertisements, rent, capital expenditures associated with de novo locations and new procedure room additions, as well as information technology and infrastructure, including our corporate office. We believe that the cash expected to be generated from operations and the availability of borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our working capital requirements, liquidity obligations, anticipated capital expenditures relating to the opening of de novo centers, and payments due under our existing credit facilities for at least the next 12 months. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 6.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and an available amount of 5.0 million under our revolving credit facility. We do not have any letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had 10.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and an available amount of 5.0 million under our revolving credit facility. We did not have any letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2023.

 Operating Activities 
 The primary source of our operating cash flow is the collection of patient payments received prior to performing surgical procedures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating cash flow decreased by 10.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributed to weaker than expected revenue performance and an increase in our marketing investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. At September 30, 2024, we had working capital of (12.5) million compared to (4.4) million at December 31, 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities during both periods were attributable to the preparation for the opening of de novo locations and the relocation of multiple existing facilities. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 10.5 million and 8.1 million, respectively. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made principal payments on our debt of 1.6 million and made payments of taxes withheld through vested equity-based compensation of 0.5 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 12.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid cash dividends to shareholders of 0.2 million and made principal payments on our debt of 11.6 million. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 The carrying value of our total indebtedness was 70.1 million and 71.6 million, which includes unamortized deferred financing costs and issuance discount of 1.1 million and 1.2 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 On November 7, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the "Credit Agreement") maturing November 7, 2027. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, there is (i) an 85.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans and (ii) a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 5.0 million. On September 29, 2023, the Company voluntarily pre-paid 10.0 million of the principal balance of the term loans under the Credit Agreement using cash on hand. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, all outstanding loans bear interest based on either a base rate or SOFR plus an applicable per annum margin. The applicable per annum margin is 2.0 or 3.0 for base rate or SOFR, respectively, if the Company's total leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.0x. If the Company's total leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 1.0x and less than 2.0x, the applicable per annum margin is 1.5 or 2.5 for base rate or SOFR, respectively. If the Company's total leverage ratio is below 1.0x, the applicable per annum margin is 1.0 or 2.0 for base rate or SOFR, respectively. 
 On September 13, 2024, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to modify certain financial condition covenants. As such, for the period of September 13, 2024 through June 30, 2025, the applicable per annum margin is 2.5 or 3.5 for

If the Company's total leverage ratio is below 1.0x, the applicable per annum margin is 1.5 or 2.5 for base rate or SOFR, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate was 7.85 . 
 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 A summary of significant accounting policies is disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K dated February 27, 2024 filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15d of the Exchange Act, as amended (the "Exchange Act") under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section. There have been no material changes in the nature of our critical accounting policies and estimates or the application of those policies from our Annual Report on Form 10-K dated February 27, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls. For these reasons, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
