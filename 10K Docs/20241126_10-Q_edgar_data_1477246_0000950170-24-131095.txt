FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: statements concerning our loan agreements, including our ability to comply with and/or secure refinancing for such loan agreements; the potential effects of global macroeconomic events on our business; the plans, strategies and objectives of management for our future operations, including our expectations for new product introductions during fiscal 2025; our implementation of our strategic review (which includes our plans to reduce annual operating expenses); our partnership with Shell and its role in enabling us to reduce our operating expenses and sharpen our focus on key growth priorities; our ability to raise capital in the future; expected development, performance or market acceptance relating to our products or services or our ability to expand our grower or customer bases or to diversify our product offerings; future economic conditions or performance; our ability to retain key employees; and our assumptions, expectations and beliefs underlying any of the foregoing. These forward-looking statements are often identified by the use of words such as, but not limited to, anticipate, believe, can, continue, could, designed, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, project, seek, should, target, will, would, and similar expressions or variations intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors, including certain assumptions, that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and assumptions include the following: 
 whether we are successful in implementing our strategies focused on growth opportunities, changes in our cost structure and improved financial performance; 

whether we are able to maintain compliance with our current loan agreements, including to provide access to sufficient liquidity to pay our growers and suppliers; 

geopolitical and macroeconomic events, such as global inflation, bank failures, supply chain disruptions, uncertain market conditions, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions, the conflict in the Middle East, and the extent to which they continue to disrupt the local and global economies, as well as our business and the businesses of our customers, distributors and suppliers; 

changes in demand for our seed products, including Double Team TM , our non-GMO herbicide tolerant sorghum solution; 

whether we are able to develop and successfully launch additional trait technology products; 

whether we are successful in commercializing our current and future trait technology products, including Double Team; 

our plans for expansion of our business (including by expanding crop offerings and market share of existing offerings through acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures and other strategic transactions) and our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions into our operations; 

whether we continue to invest in research and development and whether such investment results in trait improvement across our crop categories; 

the continued ability of our distributors and suppliers to have access to sufficient liquidity to fund their operations; 

market trends and other factors affecting our financial condition or results of operations from period to period; 

the impact of crop disease, severe weather conditions, such as drought or flooding, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, on crop quality and yields and on our ability to grow, procure or export our products; 

the impact of pricing of other crops that may influence what crops our growers elect to plant; 

whether we are successful in aligning expense levels to revenue changes; 

whether we are successful in monetizing camelina and our partnership with Shell provides its anticipated benefits; 

S W Australia's voluntary administration resulted in S W Australia s business no longer being conducted through us, which significantly reduces the scope of our overall worldwide operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations; 

the cost and other implications of pending or future legislation or court decisions and pending or future accounting pronouncements; and 

other risks that are described herein and in the section titled Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, or the Annual Report, and that are otherwise described or updated from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

2 

You are urged to carefully review the disclosures made concerning risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or operating results, which include, among others, those described above. 
 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Many factors discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, some of which are beyond our control, will be important in determining our future performance. Consequently, these statements are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from the forward-looking statements. In light of these and other uncertainties, you should not regard the inclusion of a forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved, and you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included herein are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements represent our views as of, and speak only as of, the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and such statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms we, us, our, the Company, S W and S W Seed refer to S W Seed Company and its subsidiaries or, as the context may require, S W Seed Company only. Our fiscal year ends on June 30, and accordingly, the terms fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to the respective fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with corresponding meanings to any fiscal year reference beyond such dates. Trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies appearing in this report are the property of their respective holders.

 million (USD million as of September 30, 2024), or the Parent Guarantee. The Company s obligations under the Parent Guarantee were not subject to a stay in connection with S W Australia s voluntary administration. On November 22, 2024, NAB released the Company from all liability under the Parent Guarantee, as detailed further in Note 15 - Subsequent Events. S W Australia s entry into voluntary administration also constituted an event of default under the Company s Amended CIBC Loan Agreement with CIBC Bank USA, or CIBC, as a result of a cross-default provision in the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement that is triggered by the event of default under the NAB Finance Agreement. On August 5, 2024, the Company received a waiver for the Event of Default from CIBC. The waiver stipulates that the occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an immediate event of default under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement, without notice or demand of any kind: Any notice of default and/or demand for payment is issued by NAB to the Company under the Parent Guarantee; 

 The institution of any legal proceedings by NAB against the Company; and 

 NAB takes any other judicial or non-judicial action under the Parent Guarantee or otherwise against the Company in connection with the Parent Guarantee. 

 In the event that any of the above events occur, the Company must provide immediate written notice to CIBC. The Company is also required to provide written weekly updates, in form and substance satisfactory to CIBC, addressing S W Australia s insolvency proceeding and/or any actions or communications from NAB with respect to S W Australia s insolvency proceeding or the Parent Guarantee as well as any actions or progress in furtherance of a sale of S W Australia or all or any material part of its business. None of the events of default under the August 5, 2024 CIBC waiver have occurred as of the date of this filing and the Company has also met the weekly reporting requirements as outlined in the waiver.

million and a net loss from 

10 

million, which included a million loss from the deconsolidation of S W Australia. The Company has an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of million and negative working capital of million. The Company had unused availability from its working capital facility with CIBC as of September 30, 2024 (see Note 9 - Debt for further discussion). The Company s Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with CIBC, or the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement, is classified as current on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets given that the debt is due within 12 months of the September 30, 2024. The Amended CIBC Loan Agreement matures on , given that we delivered to CIBC by November 8, 2024, an amended letter of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for the account of MFP Partners L.P., extending the letter of credit to December 31, 2024. The Amended CIBC Loan Agreement contains various financial covenants. Adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events and other factors affecting the Company s results of operations have increased the risk of the Company s inability to comply with these covenants, which could result in acceleration of its repayment obligations and foreclosure on its pledged assets. Effective September 16, 2024, and since then, the revolving loan outstanding under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement (as amended on July 3, 2024) has exceeded the total revolving loan commitment thereunder, which constitutes an event of default. On September 18, 2024, the Company received a reservation of rights letter from CIBC asserting the existence of such event of default, increasing the interest rate applicable to the loans by per annum (which is the default rate under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement), and reserving CIBC s right to immediately exercise any of CIBC s other rights or remedies under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement as it deems appropriate. As of the date of this filing, this remains in default and CIBC has not accelerated the indebtedness under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement. S W Australia s entry into voluntary administration constituted an event of default under the Company s Amended CIBC Loan Agreement, as a result of a cross-default provision in the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement that is triggered by the event of default under the NAB Finance Agreement. On August 5, 2024, the Company received a waiver for the event of default from CIBC, which contained certain stipulations outside of the Company's control and detailed further in Note 1 - General. The voluntary administration process resulted in the transfer of S W Australia's assets, as noted in Note 15 - Subsequent Events. While we obtained waivers for certain defaults and covenants in the past, there can be no assurance we will be successful in meeting our covenants, avoiding future defaults, or securing future waivers and/or amendments from our lenders. If we are unsuccessful in doing so, as currently is the case with CIBC, we may need to reduce the scope of our operations, repay amounts owing to our lenders, finance our cash needs through a combination of equity and debt financings, enter into collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, delay payments to our growers, sell certain assets or divest certain operations. Further, if the Company cannot renew or find other financing options when its debt facility with CIBC expires on November 30, 2024, it may need to reduce the scope of its operations, repay amounts owed to its lenders and/or sell certain assets. Additionally, if the Company is not able to find a buyer for S W Australia, it may be required to pay the Parent Guarantee, which, in turn, could cause the Company to reduce the scope of its operations, repay amounts owed to its lenders, and/or sell certain assets. These operating and liquidity factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 million liability being recorded for the Parent Guarantee under Bank guarantee on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 24, 2024 and September 30, 2024. The Company determined the fair value of the Parent Guarantee based on a scenario analysis, which included a discount rate ranging between and as of July 24, 2024 and and as of September 30, 2024, and a weighted average recovery rate of as of July 24, 2024 and September 30, 2024. As discussed further in Note - 15, Subsequent Events, the Company was released of the Parent Guarantee from NAB on November 22, 2024. In conjunction with the Vision Bioenergy partnership transaction, S W received a one-time option, or Purchase Option, exercisable at any time on or before the fifth anniversary of the closing of the partnership transaction, to repurchase a membership interest from Shell. The option repurchase prices range between approximately and million, depending on the date on which such purchase is completed. The Purchase Option was valued at million using a lattice option valuation model. The valuation model incorporated significant, unobservable inputs including a discounted cash flow model based on management projections of future Vision Bioenergy results and an estimate of the current per share value of Vision Bioenergy shares. In the model, the estimate of the current per share value was discounted to account for lack of control and marketability, which were considered to be part of the unit of account given the restrictions of the limited liability com pany agreement that governs the ownership rights of the members. Other unobservable inputs included the risk-free rates and the estimated future stock volatility based on the historical stock price volatilities of other market participants. A full fair value analysis will be performed at each fiscal year-end or when there is an indication that there may be an impairment to the valuation. Management will estimate and adjust the balance for interim periods. A full fair value analysis will be performed whenever there is a potential indicator of impairment to the valuation. No indicators have been identified for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to suggest any material change in the fair value of the purchase option.

Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as referred to under the heading Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, particularly in Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors. 
 Strategic Review 
 We have maintained our strategic path for operations and future growth in sorghum while continuing to execute and refine our key centers of value for our alfalfa business. With grower adoption of our Double Team sorghum solution accelerating since its fiscal 2022 launch and the continued technological development of our traited forage and grain sorghum products planned in fiscal 2025, including the introduction of two new traits - the second generation of Double Team and Prussic Acid Free - we believe we are in a unique position to be the leading technology provider of this important global crop. 
 We have continued to align our cost structure to support our key centers of value in order to drive the business towards profitability. We have reduced obsolescence costs through improved life cycle management and SKU optimization efforts with the reduction of low margin forage lines and seed treatment offerings. In fiscal 2024, we recognized improvement in our seed cost position as additional operational efficiency plans are implemented and guided by best-in-class cost standards. 
 In fiscal 2025, we plan to launch a new business model for many of our private label customers focused on licensing our product for them to sell. There will be multiple components, including a production agreement, germplasm agreement, and trait agreement, where applicable. The production agreement will provide customers with their requested, high quality seed, while the germplasm and trait agreements will only allow us to collect revenue based on the product the customer sells, which is treated as a royalty. We believe that by switching to this strategy, we will not only be more aligned with our competitors, but also provide our customers with more flexibility and control over their costs. 
 Voluntary Administration Process Involving S W Australia 
 We previously announced in 2023 that we were evaluating the possibility of a strategic transaction involving our international operations, which is headquartered within S W Seed Company Australia Pty Ltd, or S W Australia, our wholly-owned subsidiary. That process has not resulted in the consummation of a transaction and on July 24, 2024, S W Australia adopted a voluntary plan of administration based on its determination that S W Australia is likely to become insolvent within the meaning of section 436A(1) of Australia s Corporations Act 2001. In Australia, voluntary administration is a process whereby an insolvent company is placed in the hands of one or more independent administrators whose role is to investigate the company s affairs, to report to creditors and to recommend to creditors whether the company should enter into a deed of company arrangement, liquidation, or be returned to its board of directors. A number of factors combined to lead S W Australia to conclude that the voluntary plan of administration was necessary and advisable, including the lack of viable strategic alternatives for the entity, Saudi Arabia s recent discontinuation of import permits for alfalfa seed, and the increased risk that S W Australia would be unable to meet its loan obligations. 
 As a result of the voluntary administration process, as of July 24, 2024 we no longer control S W Australia for accounting purposes, and on October 11, 2024, creditors of S W Australia approved a proposed Deed of Company Arrangement, pursuant to which, among other things, the outstanding shares of S W Australia would be transferred to a third party. Our expectation was that S W Australia would no longer be our subsidiary, or owned or controlled by us in any manner, at the conclusion of the voluntary administration process and therefore all of the related business conducted through S W Australia would cease to be included within the scope of our business. Since we no longer control S W Australia for accounting purposes, S W Australia was deconsolidated from our financial statements as of July 24, 2024. We will not regain control of S W Australia at the conclusion of the voluntary administration process, as detailed further in Note 15 - Subsequent Events in Part I, Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements provided in this Item 2 do not include financial results from S W Australia. 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 At a special meeting of stockholders held on September 26, 2024, our stockholders approved a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio in the range of 1-for-5 to 1-for-20, with such ratio to be determined in the discretion of our board of directors, or Board, and on October 4, 2024 the Board unanimously approved a reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, at a ratio of 1-for-19, or the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split was implemented at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 17, 2024. 
 Our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis commencing upon market opening on The Nasdaq Capital Market on October 18, 2024. We have retroactively adjusted all share amounts and per share data herein to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.

Global Economic Conditions 
 We are subject to additional risks and uncertainties as a result of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events, such as the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia and related sanctions, the armed conflict in Sudan, the conflict in the Middle East, the import ban on alfalfa seed in Saudi Arabia, uncertain market conditions, including higher inflation and supply chain disruptions, recent bank failures, and other global events, which have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business, operations and the markets and communities in which we, our partners and customers operate. 
 Following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in early 2022, the U.S. and global financial markets experienced volatility, which has led to disruptions to trade, commerce, pricing stability, credit availability, supply chain continuity and reduced access to liquidity globally. In response to the invasion, the United States, United Kingdom and European Union, along with others, imposed significant new sanctions and export controls against Russia, Russian banks and certain Russian individuals and may implement additional sanctions or take further punitive actions in the future. The full economic and social impact of the sanctions imposed on Russia and possible future punitive measures that may be implemented, as well as the counter measures imposed by Russia, in addition to the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia and related sanctions, which could conceivably expand into the surrounding region, remains uncertain; however, both the conflict and related sanctions have resulted and could continue to result in disruptions to trade, commerce, pricing stability, credit availability, supply chain continuity and reduced access to liquidity on acceptable terms, in both Europe and globally, and has introduced significant uncertainty into global markets. 
 The armed conflict in Sudan, which began in April 2023, has disrupted our shipments to the country. In Saudi Arabia, the Department of Ministry discontinued their approval of import permits for all forage seed, which includes alfalfa and all grasses, as a means of water conservation in May 2024, which is expected to last several years. To help mitigate any reduction in seed sales to Sudan and Saudi Arabia, we are actively exploring sales into adjacent markets in the region. 
 Additionally, in October 2023, Hamas initiated an attack against Israel, resulting in a state of war. The conflict, and the potential continued escalation or expansion of the conflict, could result in additional sanctions, cause disruptions to global economic conditions and affect the stability of the Middle East region and our business in that region. For example, we have experienced disruptions and significant delays in shipping through this region due to threats of piracy in the Red Sea area, in which Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (a main port of entry for Saudi Arabia) is located, and which is the primary access point for shipments through the Suez Canal. 
 Our product revenue is predicated on our ability to timely fulfill customer orders, which depends in large part upon the consistent availability and operation of shipping and distribution networks operated by third parties. Farmers typically have a limited window during which they can plant seed, and their buying decisions can be shaped by actual or perceived disruptions in our distribution and supply channels, or concerns about our ability to timely fulfill their orders. If our customers delay or decrease their orders due to potential disruptions in our distribution and supply channels, including as a result of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events, this will adversely affect our product revenue. 
 The ultimate impact of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events will have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements remains uncertain and ultimately will be dictated by the length and severity of such events and any broad-based supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, rising levels of inflation and interest rates, tightening of credit markets or other developments resulting from recent geopolitical and macroeconomic events. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of those potential and evolving impacts to our business and Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Components of Our Statements of Operations Data 
 Revenue 
 We derive most of our revenue from the sale of our proprietary seed varieties and hybrids. We expect that over the next several years, a substantial majority of our revenue will be generated from the sale of sorghum and alfalfa, although we are continually assessing other possible product offerings or means to increase revenue, including expanding into higher margin crops. 
 The mix of our product offerings will continue to change over time with the introduction of new seed varieties and hybrids resulting from our robust research and development efforts. Potential sources of new revenue include expansion of novel, non-GMO product lines, entry into gene-edited product markets, entry into specialty crop markets, such as biofuels, and additional strategic transactions. 
 Our revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of orders from our customers and distributors and the extent to which markets are impacted by sources of instability and volatility in global markets and industries. In fiscal 2024, we were impacted, among other things, by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the armed conflict in Sudan, the conflict in the Middle East, the import ban on alfalfa seed in Saudi Arabia, supply chain issues and global inflation. Because some of our large customers and distributors order in bulk only one or two times per year, our product revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Some of this fluctuation is offset by having operations in both the northern and southern hemispheres. In addition, due to the numerous logistical challenges we have experienced in our shipping and distribution networks resulting from current geopolitical and macroeconomic events, our product revenue has fluctuated, and our ability to recognize revenues within a particular fiscal period has been impacted. We expect our product revenue will fluctuate from period to period as a result of current geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions. 
 30 

Cost of Revenue (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization) and Gross Profit 
 Cost of revenue relates to sale of our seed products and consists of the cost of procuring seed, plant conditioning and packaging costs, direct labor and raw materials and overhead costs. Gross profit represents the profit remaining after deducting these costs from total revenue. As Double Team sorghum continues to gain market acceptance, we expect to see additional favorability in our gross profit. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee costs, including salaries, employee benefits and share-based compensation, as well as professional service fees, insurance, marketing, travel and entertainment expense, public company expense and other overhead costs. We proactively take steps on an ongoing basis to control selling, general and administrative expenses as much as is reasonably possible. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in the discovery, development, breeding and testing of new products incorporating the traits we have specifically selected. These expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits, consultant services, land leased for field trials, chemicals and supplies and other external expenses. 
 Overall, we have been focused on controlling research and development expenses, while balancing that objective against the recognition that continued advancement in product development is an important part of our strategic planning. We intend to focus our resources on high value activities. For sorghum, we plan to invest in higher value grain products, proprietary herbicide tolerance traits and improved safety and palatability in forage products. We expect our research and development expenses will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of various research and development projects. 
 Our internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred, while third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. The costs associated with equipment or facilities acquired or constructed for research and development activities that have alternative future uses are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 We amortize intangible assets, including Chromatin Inc. in 2018 and from SV Genetics Pty Ltd in 2016, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, consisting of periods of 10 to 30 years for technology/IP/germplasm, 5 to 20 years for customer relationships and trade names and 10 to 20 years for other intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, consisting of periods of 5 to 35 years for buildings, 3 to 20 years for machinery and equipment, 7 to 10 years for leasehold improvements and 2 to 5 years for vehicles. 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 Other (income) expense consists of foreign currency losses, interest expense, interest expense resulting from the amortization of debt discount, and other income. Interest expense and interest expense - amortization of debt discount primarily consists of interest costs related to outstanding borrowings on our working capital credit facilities. Amortization of the MFP Letter of Credit (as defined below) asset is also recorded to Interest expense - amortization of debt discount. 
 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates, differences in the deductibility of certain expenses and inclusion of certain income items between financial statement and tax return purposes, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. Tax regulations require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when those items are required to be recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, our effective tax rate reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is different from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as meals and entertainment expenses that are not fully deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Based on financial projections, we do not believe that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized, and a full valuation allowance is recorded against them. 
 Equity in loss of equity method investee, net of tax 
 Equity in loss of equity method investee, net of tax, represents our proportionate share of loss from our 34 interest in Vision Bioenergy for the periods presented.

(1) Amount in column may not foot due to rounding 
 The discussion and analysis presented below is concerned with material changes in our results of operations between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. All comparisons presented are with respect to the prior year period, unless stated otherwise. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on November 1, 2024. If activity is consistent year-over-year, explanations may not be given. 
 Revenue 
 The 2.4 million year-over-year decrease in revenue is due to a 1.5 million decrease in non-dormant alfalfa sales in the Middle East and North Africa region driven by the import ban on alfalfa in Saudi Arabia, a 0.8 million decrease in sorghum sales in Mexico related to tightening of credit policies and carryover seed from the prior year in the market, a 0.5 million decrease in Double Team sorghum revenue, a 0.4 million decrease in sorghum sales to South Africa due to limited inventory supply of compatible hybrids, and a 0.3 million decrease in conventional sorghum sales due to an extended sales season in the prior year. This decrease was offset by a 0.5 million increase in non-dormant alfalfa sales in the United States, a 0.3 million increase in non-dormant alfalfa sales in Mexico, and a 0.3 million increase in dormant alfalfa sales in the United States. 
 Cost of Revenue (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization) and Gross Profit 
 Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year and the gross profit percentage decreased to 16.1 from 25.3 compared to the prior year period. The profit decrease was driven by a 6.5 point decrease attributable to the International segment, with a 3.8 point decrease related to lower selling prices in the Middle East North Africa region due lower demand, and a 2.7 point decrease in margin related to South Africa sorghum sales due to the available supply of reduced quality and low cost seed in the prior year. The net gross profit for the Americas segment decreased primarily due to inventory write-offs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 The 0.2 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is attributable to a 0.2 million decrease in stock based compensation, a 0.2 million decrease in other operating expenses related primarily to no bad debt expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.1 million decrease in office expenses related to lower software expenses, a 0.1 million decrease in compensation and benefits and other personnel expenses, and a 0.1 million decrease in audit fees related to higher fees for the fiscal 2023 financial statements seen in the prior year period. The cost savings were offset by a 0.2 million increase in restructuring charges 
 32 

related to the Australian legal entity, a 0.2 million increase in legal fees, and a 0.1 million increase in board of director expenses in part due to their being an additional board member. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily consisted of interest incurred on our CIBC working capital facility, the AgAmerica loan, the MFP Loan, and equipment capital leases. The 0.2 million decrease was primarily due to the decreased outstanding loan amounts resulting in lower interest owed to lenders. 
 Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes 
 The income tax expense totaled 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our effective tax rate was 0.0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to the valuation allowance recorded against substantially all of our deferred tax assets. Due to the valuation allowance, we do not record the income tax expense or benefit related to substantially all of our current year operation results. 
 Net Loss from Discontinued Operations 
 The 9.1 million change in net loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is due to the 9.8 million loss on the deconsolidation of S W Australia recognized on July 24, 2024, offset by a 0.7 million decrease attributable to S W Australia operations, largely due to only capturing activity from July 1, 2024 through July 24, 2024 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 3 - Discontinued Operations in Part I, Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Results of Business Segments 
 Prior to the voluntary administration of S W Australia, we had three operating and reportable segments that corresponded with our operating model, management structure, and internal reporting reviewed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective with the loss of control of S W Australia on July 24, 2024, this was reduced to two operating and reportable segments. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker currently allocates resources and assesses performance based on these two segments, with a key performance metric utilized being gross profit. Our two operating segments, each its own reportable segment, are Americas and International. Note, as a result of the voluntary administration of S W Australia, our Chief Operating Decision Maker no longer allocates resources and assesses performance for the AUSDOM segment and for the International segment related to S W Australia. 
 Americas : Consists of operations in the United States that results in sales across North and South America. Total revenue for the Americas segment represented 50 and 45 of our total consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was largely made up of alfalfa and sorghum sales. Americas revenue decreased by 0.7 million due to reduced sorghum sales in Mexico, decreased Double Team sorghum sales in the United States and decreased conventional sorghum sales, offset by increased alfalfa sales in the United States and Mexico. 
 International : Consists of operations in the United States that results in sales to countries outside of North and South America. Revenue in the International segment is largely alfalfa products in addition to some sorghum and sunflower products. A large concentration of these sales went to the Middle East and North Africa region. Total revenue for the International segment represented 49 and 55 of the our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was largely alfalfa product sales in addition to some sorghum and sunflower product sales. Total revenue decreased by 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to fewer sales to the Middle East North Africa region due to the import ban in Saudi Arabia, amongst other reasons. 
 As presented in the table below, Other consists of intercompany activity with S W Australia. This has historically been eliminated; however, as we are not consolidating this subsidiary, the activity is no longer eliminated. 
 Our total revenue broken out by reportable segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

Gross profit and the gross profit percentage in each segment were down for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For both segments, the reduction in gross profit is attributable to reduced sales in each segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the International segment, the gross profit percentage is down for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the import ban in Saudi Arabia reducing demand and resulted in lower selling prices. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our working capital and working capital requirements fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the phase of the growing and sales cycle that falls during a particular quarter. Our need for cash has historically been highest in the second and third fiscal quarters (October through March) because we pay our North American contracted growers progressively, starting in the second fiscal quarter. In fiscal 2024, we paid our North American growers approximately 50 of amounts due in the fall of 2023 and the balance was paid in the spring of 2024. This payment cycle to our growers was similar in fiscal 2023 and we expect it to be similar for fiscal 2025. 
 Historically, due to the concentration of sales to certain distributors, our month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter sales and associated cash receipts are highly dependent upon the timing of deliveries to and payments from these distributors, which varies significantly from year-to-year. 
 We continuously monitor and evaluate our credit policies with all our customers based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of the respective trade accounts receivable balance. Our principal working capital components include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and our working capital lines of credit. 
 In addition to funding our business with cash from operations, we have historically relied upon occasional sales of our debt and equity securities and credit facilities from financial institutions. 
 S W Australia, our Australia-based wholly owned subsidiary, adopted a voluntary plan of administration on July 24, 2024 based on its determination that S W Australia is likely to become insolvent within the meaning of section 436A(1) of Australia s Corporations Act 2001. In Australia, voluntary administration is a process whereby an insolvent company is placed in the hands of one or more independent administrators whose role is to investigate the company s affairs, to report to creditors and to recommend to creditors whether the company should enter into a deed of company arrangement, liquidation, or be returned to its board of directors. A voluntary administration involves an investigation of available options to provide a better return to creditors and, if possible, to save the business. As a result of the voluntary administration process, as of July 24, 2024 we no longer control S W Australia for accounting purposes, and on October 11, 2024, creditors of S W Australia approved a proposed Deed of Company Arrangement, pursuant to which, among other things, the outstanding shares of S W Australia would be transferred to a third party. Our expectation was that S W Australia would no longer be our subsidiary, or owned or controlled by us in any manner, at the conclusion of the voluntary administration process and therefore all of the related business conducted through S W Australia would cease to be included within the scope of our business. Since we no longer control S W Australia for accounting purposes, S W Australia was deconsolidated from our financial statements prospectively as of July 24, 2024. We will not regain control of S W Australia at the conclusion of the voluntary administration process, as detailed further in Note 15 - Subsequent Events in Part I, Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Capital Resources and Material Cash Requirements 
 We are not profitable and have had negative cash flow from operations for the last several years, excluding the fiscal 2023 gain recognized in relation to the Vision Bioenergy partnership. To help fund our operations, we have relied on debt and equity financings, and we will need to obtain additional funding to finance our operations in the future. Accordingly, we are actively evaluating financing and strategic alternatives, including debt and equity financings and potential sales of assets or certain lines of business. 
 We expect to meet our future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and through debt financing, among other sources of capital. Our ability to fund our operating needs will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows through sales of our products, our ability to find other sufficient financing options if we are unable to renew our existing debt facilities, the impacts of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events, and other factors, including those discussed under the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on November 1, 2024. 
 Below is a summary of material changes to our sources of capital during fiscal 2025 to date: 
 CIBC Loan Agreement 
 On July 3, 2024, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or the Third Amendment, with CIBC, which amended the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement, by and among the Company, as borrower, and CIBC, as administrative agent and sole lead arranger. The Third Amendment, effective as of July 1, 2024, among other things: 
 subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing covenants, extended the maturity date from August 31, 2024 to October 31, 2024, or the Maturity Date; 

modified the maximum loan commitment under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement to (i) 20.0 million from July 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024, (ii) 18.5 million from August 1, 2024 through September 1, 2024, (iii) 17.5 million from September 2, 2024 through September 15, 2024, (iv) 15.0 million from September 16, 2024 through October 9, 2024, and (v) 13.0 million from October 10, 2024 through the Maturity Date; 

modified the eligible inventory sublimit under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement from 5.0 million from July 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 to (i) 8.5 million from July 1, 2024 through July 14, 2024, (ii) 7.5 million from July 15, 2024 through August 14, 2024, (iii) 7.0 million from August 15, 2024 through September 15, 2024, (iv) 6.5 million from September 16, 2024 through September 29, 2024, and (v) 5.0 million from September 30, 2024 through the Maturity Date; 

added certain post-closing covenants which, should the Company not comply with the amended terms, shall constitute an immediate event of default under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement; 

added a fee of 15,000 payable by the Company to CIBC on the date of the Third Amendment; 

added a fee of 10,000 payable by the Company to CIBC monthly beginning July 1, 2024, and payable only if the eligible inventory sublimit is greater than 5.0 million; and 

added a fee of 25,000 payable by the Company to CIBC on October 1, 2024, and payable only if the Company does not repay the obligations under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement in full by September 30, 2024. 

On October 31, 2024, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with CIBC, or the Fourth Amendment, which amended the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement by and among the Company, as borrower, and CIBC, as administrative agent and sole lead arranger. The Fourth Amendment, effective as of October 31, 2024, among other things: 
 extended the maturity date from October 31, 2024 to November 30, 2024, and, contingent upon the Company's delivery to CIBC of an amended letter of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for the account of MFP, and for the benefit of CIBC, that expires on December 31, 2024 or after, which was delivered on November 8, 2024; and 

provided for a fee of 25,000 payable by the Company to CIBC on the date of the Fourth Amendment. 

Except as modified by the Third Amendment and Fourth Amendment, all terms and conditions of the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement remain in full force and effect. 
 All amounts outstanding under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement, including, but not limited to, accrued and unpaid principal and interest due under the CIBC Credit Facility, will be due and payable in full on November 30, 2024 (as we delivered to CIBC by November 8, 2024 an amended letter of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for the account of MFP, extending the letter of credit to December 31, 2024). As of September 16, 2024, and since then, the revolving loan outstanding under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement (as amended by the Third Amendment) has exceeded the total revolving loan commitment thereunder, which constitutes an event of default under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement. On September 18, 2024, we received a reservation of rights letter from CIBC asserting the existence of such event of default, increasing the interest rate applicable to the loans by 2 per annum (which is the default rate under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement), and reserving CIBC s right to immediately exercise any of CIBC s other rights or 
 35 

remedies under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement as it deems appropriate. As of the date of this filing, CIBC has not accelerated the indebtedness under the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement. 
 MFP Loan Agreement 
 On July 16, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to Subordinate Loan and Security Agreement with MFP, or the MFP Amendment, amending the MFP Loan Agreement with MFP, to (i) extend the maturity date of the letter of credit to November 30, 2024 and (ii) extend the maturity date of the MFP Loan Agreement to May 31, 2025. Except as modified by the MFP Amendment, all terms and conditions of the MFP Loan Agreement remain in full force and effect. 
 On October 31, 2024, we entered into a Fifth Amendment to Subordinate Loan and Security Agreement with MFP, or the MFP Fifth Amendment, further amending the MFP Loan Agreement with MFP, to extend the maturity date of the letter of credit to December 31, 2024. Except as modified by the MFP Fifth Amendment, all terms and conditions of the MFP Loan Agreement remain in full force and effect. 
 AgAmerica Note 
 No amendments have occurred to the AgAmerica Agreement for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or subsequent to period end. Due to the delayed filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, we were not in compliance with the reporting requirements per the AgAmerica Loan Agreement; however, a waiver was received from AgAmerica for such non-compliance, executed on November 1, 2024. 
 Summary 
 The Amended CIBC Loan Agreement contains various operating and financial covenants. Adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events and uncertain market conditions have increased the risk of our inability to comply with these covenants, which could result in acceleration of our repayment obligations and foreclosure on our pledged assets. In addition, our loan agreements, including S W Australia's NAB Finance Agreement, contains cross-default provisions, such that certain defaults or breaches under any of our loan agreements may entitle lenders to invoke default remedies. 
 S W Australia s entry into voluntary administration on July 24, 2024 constituted an event of default and automatic acceleration of S W Australia s obligations under the NAB Finance Agreement. However, such acceleration is stayed while S W Australia is under voluntary administration. The NAB Finance Agreement was guaranteed by us, up to a maximum of AUD 15.0 million (USD 10.4 million as of September 30, 2024), or the Parent Guarantee. Our obligations under the Parent Guarantee were not subject to a stay in connection with S W Australia s voluntary administration. On November 22, 2024, NAB released the Company from all liability under the Parent Guarantee, as detailed further in Note 15 - Subsequent Events in Part I, Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. S W Australia s entry into voluntary administration also constituted an event of default under our Amended CIBC Loan Agreement, as a result of a cross-default provision in the Amended CIBC Loan Agreement that is triggered by the event of default under the NAB Finance Agreement. On August 5, 2024, we received a waiver for the event of default from CIBC, which contained certain stipulations. 
 Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including: 
 the maturity and repayment of our debt; 

the extent and sustainability of future operating income; 

the level and timing of future sales and expenditures; 

timing for when we are able to recognize revenue; 

working capital required to support our growth; 

our ability to timely pay our growers; 

investment capital for plant and equipment; 

investment in our sales and marketing programs; 

investment capital for potential acquisitions; 

our ability to renew and/or refinance our debt on acceptable terms; 

our ability to raise equity financing, in order to secure refinancing as well as support our operations, among other things; 

competition; 

market developments; and 

36 

developments related to adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events, including bank failures, inflation and supply chain disruptions. 

We cannot assure you that we will be successful in renewing or refinancing our existing debt, raising additional capital, securing future waivers and/or amendments from CIBC or our other lenders, or securing new financing. If we are unsuccessful in doing so, we may need to reduce the scope of our operations, repay amounts owing to our lenders, finance our cash needs through a combination of equity and debt financings, enter into collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, sell certain assets or divest certain operations. 
 If we are required or desire to raise additional capital in the future, whether as a condition to loan refinancing or separately, such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or available at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest would be diluted and the terms of these securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, may be secured by all or a portion of our assets, and may be on terms less favorable than our existing loans. If we fail to obtain additional capital as and when required, such failure could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 As a result of the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the armed conflict in Sudan, the conflict in the Middle East, the import ban on alfalfa seed in Saudi Arabia, and other geopolitical and macroeconomic factors beyond our control, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. On March 10, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took control and was appointed receiver of Silicon Valley Bank. While we did not have deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, if other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments may be threatened and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. It is possible that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will occur. If equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may affect our ability to raise equity capital, borrow on our existing facilities, access our existing cash, or make any additional necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive. In addition, our ability to comply with the terms of our loan agreements can be compromised and could result in an event of default. If an event of default were to occur, our lenders could accelerate our repayment obligations or enforce their other rights under our agreements with them. Any such default may also require us to seek additional or alternative financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 from our continuing operations:

Operating Activities 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities provided 0.8 million in cash. Of this, the net loss excluding non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows used 3.8 million in cash and changes in operating assets and liabilities as detailed on the statement of cash flows provided 4.6 million in cash. The increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a 6.1 million increase in accounts payable, a 2.1 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a 1.2 million increase in deferred revenue from prepayments for our fiscal 2025 United States domestic business, a 0.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a 0.5 million increase in payables from unconsolidated subsidiary due to the deconsolidation of S W Australia, offset by a 4.2 million increase in inventory and a 1.9 million increase in accounts receivable. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities provided 2.1 million in cash. Of this, the net loss excluding non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows used 2.3 million in cash and changes in operating assets and liabilities as detailed on the statement of cash flows provided 4.3 million in cash. The increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a 5.2 million increase in accounts payable and a 1.7 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities offset by a 1.6 million increase in accounts receivable, a 0.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a 0.5 million increase in inventories. 
 37 

Investing Activities 
 Investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 used 0.1 million in cash, which resulted from 0.1 million in additions to property, plant and equipment for our United States facilities. 
 Investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 used 0.0 million in cash, which resulted from 0.1 million in additions to property, plant and equipment for our United States and Australian facilities offset by 0.1 million in proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment from our United States and Australian facilities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, used 0.5 million in cash, consisting of 0.3 million in net borrowings and repayments on the working capital lines of credit, 0.1 million in debt issuance costs and 0.1 million in repayments of long term debt. 
 Financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2023, used 4.5 million in cash, consisting of 4.3 million in net borrowings and repayments on the working capital lines of credit and 0.2 million in net proceeds from sale of common stock. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflationary pressures on labor and commodity price increases directly impacted our condensed consolidated results of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and we expect this to continue throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2025. We attempt to manage any inflationary costs through selective price increases and changes in product mix, but rapidly changing inflationary pressures from global commodity prices and logistics could impact our costs of goods before pricing adjustments can be implemented. Delays in implementing such price increases, competitive pressures, and other factors may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in the future. Inherent volatility experienced in certain commodity markets could have a significant effect on our results of operations and may have an adverse effect on us in the future. The extent of any impact will depend on our ability to manage such volatility through the product mix that we sell and selective price increases. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 In preparing our financial statements, we must select and apply various accounting policies in accordance with GAAP. Our most significant policies are discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Part I, Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In order to apply our accounting policies, we often need to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, based upon the information available to us. In making such estimates, we rely on historical experience, market and other conditions, and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. However, the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control. If market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate, our results of operations, financial condition and changes in financial condition may be materially affected. In addition, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or to take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or changes in financial condition. Members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates, and our disclosure regarding them, with the audit committee of our Board, and do so on a regular basis. 
 Other than the bank guarantee below, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or in the methodology used for estimates from those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on November 1, 2024. 
 Bank Guarantee 
 The Company s obligations under the Parent Guarantee were not subject to stay in connection with S W Australia s voluntary administration and follows the terms of the facilities S W Australia has with NAB, with the primary borrowing base line expiring on March 31, 2025. As the Company lost control and deconsolidated S W Australia as a result from the voluntary administration process, the Company must recognize a liability for the fair value of the Parent Guarantee per ASC 460, Guarantees. In order for this any payments to occur, NAB must first make a claim under the Parent Guarantee, which has not occurred as of September 30, 2024. The Company assessed the fair value of the Parent Guarantee as of July 24, 2024 and elected to record the guarantee at fair value at each reporting date, with any changes in fair value being recorded as a gain or loss in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company obtained an independent valuation, assigning probabilities under various scenarios and applying estimated recovery and discount rates, which resulted in a 5.0 million liability being recorded for the Parent Guarantee under Bank guarantee on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 24, 2024 and September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. 	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company and, therefore, we are not required to provide information typically disclosed under this item.

Item 4. 	Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, and as a result of the material weaknesses described below, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Notwithstanding such material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the year ended June 30, 2024, in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to having inadequate controls to appropriately analyze all relevant information required for complete and accurate presentation and disclosure under GAAP, or the First Material Weakness. 
 During the current period, the Company identified an additional material weakness. The Company lacked an effectively designed system of internal control to ensure appropriate recognition and measurement of non-routine transactions under GAAP, or the Second Material Weakness. 
 Status of Remediation of Material Weakness 
 To remediate the First Material Weakness, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we undertook efforts to improve our controls over financial reporting with respect to the analysis of all relevant information required for complete and accurate presentation and disclosure under GAAP. Management is updating its internal control procedures to include, among other things, quarterly monitoring of any changes within the Company and its impact on financial reporting. While we believe that these efforts will improve our internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of our remediation is ongoing and we will not consider the material weakness remediated until our controls are operational for a sufficient period of time and tested, enabling management to conclude that the controls are operating effectively. Therefore, the First Material Weakness has not been remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 As it pertains to the Second Material Weakness, management is implementing certain changes in our internal controls as of the filing of this report to address the material weakness to include, among other things, quarterly monitoring of non-routine transactions, including detailed reviews with all applicable parties, and its impact on our financial reporting to ensure appropriate recognition and measurement under GAAP to address the material weakness. However, no assurance can be given that these changes will remediate the material weakness until such time that the controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and their operating effectiveness has been tested. 
 While the foregoing measures are intended to effectively remediate the material weaknesses described in this Item 4, it is possible that additional remediation steps will be necessary. As such, as we continue to evaluate and implement our plan to remediate the material weaknesses, our management may decide to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses or modify the remediation steps described above. Until the material weaknesses are remediated, we plan to continue to perform additional analyses and other procedures to help ensure that our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the remediation measures described above, there have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) or in other factors that occurred during the period of our evaluation that have significantly affected, or are reasonably likely to significantly affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II 
 OTHER INF ORMATION 
 Item 1.	Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including pending opposition proceedings involving patents that arise in the ordinary course of business. 
 On July 24, 2024, S W Australia adopted a voluntary plan of administration based on its determination that S W Australia is likely to become insolvent within the meaning of section 436A(1) of Australia s Corporations Act 2001. In Australia, voluntary administration is a process whereby an insolvent company is placed in the hands of one or more independent administrators whose role is to investigate the company s affairs, to report to creditors and to recommend to creditors whether the company should enter into a deed of company arrangement, liquidation, or be returned to its board of directors. Voluntary administration involves an investigation of available options to provide a better return to creditors and, if possible, to save the business. 
 There are no other matters pending that we expect to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Item 1A.	Ris k Factors.

 On November 21, 2024, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, advising us that our failure to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or the Form 10-Q, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, is in contravention of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), or the Filing Requirement, and could serve as a basis for the delisting of our securities from Nasdaq. We have 60 days from the date of the notice to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Filing Requirement for consideration by Nasdaq. We believe that the filing of this Form 10-Q allows us to regain compliance with the Filing Requirement.
