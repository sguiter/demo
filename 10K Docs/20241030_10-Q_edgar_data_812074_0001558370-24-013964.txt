O-I GLASS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Tabular data dollars in millions, except per share amounts reportable segments and operating segments based on its geographic locations: the Americas and Europe. These segments are aligned with the Company s internal approach to managing, reporting, and evaluating performance of its global glass operations. Certain assets and activities not directly related to one of the segments or to glass manufacturing are reported within Retained corporate costs and other. These include licensing, equipment manufacturing, global engineering, certain equity investments and certain minor businesses in the Asia Pacific region. Retained corporate costs and other also includes certain headquarters administrative and facilities costs and certain incentive compensation and other benefit plan costs that are global in nature and are not allocable to the reportable segments. The Company s measure of profit for its reportable segments is segment operating profit, which consists of consolidated earnings before interest income, interest expense, and provision for income taxes and excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments, as well as certain retained corporate costs. The Company s management, including the chief operating decision maker (defined as the Chief Executive Officer), uses segment operating profit, supplemented by net sales and selected cash flow information, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment operating profit for reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Segment operating profit is not a recognized term under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP and, therefore, does not purport to be an alternative to earnings (loss) before income taxes. Further, the Company's measure of segment operating profit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Cash Flow Hedges of Foreign Exchange Risk The Company has variable-interest rate borrowings denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiaries. As a result, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in the currency of the borrowing against the subsidiaries functional currency. In addition, one of the Company s non-U.S. dollar-functional-currency subsidiaries purchases a raw material in the normal course of business for use in glass container production that is priced in U.S. dollars. Such purchases expose the Company to exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses derivatives to manage these exposures and designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges of foreign currency exchange risk. unrecognized gains related to cross-currency swaps were included in Accumulated OCI. Fair Value Hedges of Foreign Exchange Risk The Company has fixed and variable interest rate borrowings denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiaries. As a result, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in the currency of the borrowing against the subsidiaries functional currency. The Company uses derivatives to manage these exposures and designates these derivatives as fair value hedges of foreign currency exchange risk. Approximately million, million and million of the components were excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and are included in Accumulated OCI at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net Investment Hedges The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments it holds in non-U.S. subsidiaries and uses cross-currency swaps to partially hedge this exposure. Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The Company uses short-term forward exchange or option agreements to purchase foreign currencies at set rates in the future. These agreements are used to limit exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for significant planned purchases of fixed assets or commodities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency. The Company also uses foreign exchange agreements to offset the foreign currency exchange rate risk for receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables, payables, and loans, not denominated in, or indexed to, their functional currencies.

Information related to major programs is presented separately, while minor initiatives are presented on a combined basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s only major restructuring program was the Fit to Win initiative which is expected to reduce redundant production capacity and begin to optimize the network, as well as streamline other cost areas, such as selling, general and administrative expenses. Details regarding charges, payments and other changes to the Fit to Win restructuring accruals are presented in the table above. This major restructuring program is expected to last at least through 2025 and management does not yet have an estimate for the total restructuring charges expected to be incurred with this program, however, the total charges are expected to be material. As of September 30, 2023, no major restructuring programs were in effect. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately million to Other expense, net million) and Equity earnings million) on the Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations, of which million related to the Fit to Win program.

The Company expects that the majority of the remaining cash expenditures related to the accrued employee and other exit costs will be paid out over the next several years. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company implemented several discrete restructuring initiatives and recorded restructuring and other charges of million. These charges consisted of employee costs, such as severance and benefit-related costs, write-down of assets and other exit costs in the Americas million) and Europe million) segments. These restructuring charges were discrete actions and are expected to approximate the total cumulative costs for those actions as no significant additional costs are expected to be incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, these charges were recorded to Other income (expense), net on the Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations. The Company expects that the majority of the remaining cash expenditures related to the accrued employee and other exit costs will be paid out over the next several years. The Company s decisions to curtail selected production capacity have resulted in write-downs of certain long-lived assets to the extent their carrying value exceeded fair value or fair value less cost to sell. The Company classified the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the impaired assets in the period that the measurement was taken as Level 3 (third-party appraisals, where applicable) in the fair value hierarchy as set forth in the general accounting principles for fair value measurements. For the asset impairments recorded during both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the remaining carrying value of the impaired assets was approximately .

The Company is currently under income tax examination in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates, including Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Peru, and the U.S. The years under examination range from 2004 through 2023. The Company has received tax assessments in excess of established reserves. The Company is contesting these tax assessments, and will continue to do so, including pursuing all available remedies, such as appeals and litigation, if necessary. The Company believes that adequate provisions for all income tax uncertainties have been made. However, if tax assessments are settled against the Company at amounts in excess of established reserves, it could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax examinations, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate any tax assessments that may be settled at amounts in excess of established reserves in future periods, or the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these provisions for income tax uncertainties.

On March 25, 2022, certain of the Company s subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement and Syndicated Facility Agreement (the Original Agreement ), which refinanced in full the previous credit agreement. The Original Agreement provided for up to billion of borrowings pursuant to term loans, revolving credit facilities and a delayed draw term loan facility. The delayed draw term loan facility allowed for a one-time borrowing of up to million, the proceeds of which were used, in addition to other consideration paid by the Company and/or its subsidiaries, to fund an asbestos settlement trust (the Paddock Trust established in connection with the confirmed plan of reorganization of Paddock Enterprises, LLC Paddock proposed by Paddock, O-I Glass and certain other parties in Paddock s Chapter 11 case. On July 18, 2022, the Company drew down the million delayed draw term loan to fund, together with other consideration, the Paddock Trust. On August 30, 2022, certain of the Company s subsidiaries entered into an Amendment No. 1 to its Credit Agreement and Syndicated Facility Agreement (the Credit Agreement Amendment ), which amends the Original Agreement (as amended by the Credit Agreement Amendment, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement Amendment provides for up to million of additional borrowings in the form of term loans. The proceeds of such term loans were used, together with cash, to retire the million delayed draw term loan. The term loans mature, and the revolving credit facilities terminate, in March 2027. The term loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement Amendment are secured by certain collateral of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Agreement Amendment makes modifications to certain loan documents, in order to give the Company increased flexibility to incur secured debt in the future.

million revolving credit facility, a million multicurrency revolving credit facility and billion in term loan A facilities billion outstanding balance at September 30, 2024, net of debt issuance costs ). At September 30, 2024, the Company had unused credit of billion available under the revolving credit facilities as part of the Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024 was . The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur certain indebtedness and liens, make certain investments, become liable under contingent obligations in certain defined instances only, make restricted payments, make certain asset sales within guidelines and limits, engage in certain affiliate transactions, participate in sale and leaseback financing arrangements, alter its fundamental business, and amend certain subordinated debt obligations. The Credit Agreement also contains financial maintenance covenant, a Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), that requires the Company not to exceed a ratio of x calculated by dividing consolidated Net Indebtedness that is then secured by Liens on property or assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries by Consolidated EBITDA, as each term is defined and as described in the Credit Agreement. The Secured Leverage Ratio could restrict the ability of the Company to undertake additional financing or acquisitions to the extent that such financing or acquisitions would cause the Secured Leverage Ratio to exceed the specified maximum. Failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. In such an event, the Company could not request additional borrowings under the revolving facilities, and all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence and for the duration of a payment event of default, an additional default interest rate equal to per annum will apply to all overdue obligations under the Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement and the lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Agreement to become due and payable, this would result in a default under the indentures governing the Company s outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company believes that it will remain in compliance for the term of the Credit Agreement and that its ability to borrow additional funds under the Credit Agreement will not be adversely affected by the covenants and restrictions. The Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) determines pricing under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement is, at the Company s option, the Base Rate, Term SOFR or, for non-U.S. dollar borrowings only, the Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is linked to the Total Leverage Ratio. The margins range from to for Term SOFR loans and Eurocurrency Rate loans and from to for Base Rate loans. In addition, a commitment fee is payable on the unused revolving credit facility commitments ranging from to per annum linked to the Total Leverage Ratio. Obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets, excluding real estate and certain other excluded assets, of certain of the Company s domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries. Such obligations are also secured by a pledge of intercompany debt and equity investments in certain of the Company s domestic subsidiaries and, in the case of foreign obligations, of stock of certain foreign subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and certain foreign obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company.

million, million and million (undiscounted) as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, for estimated future remediation and monitoring costs at these sites. Although the Company believes its accruals are adequate to cover its portion of future remediation and monitoring costs, there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not exceed the amount of the Company s accruals and will not have a material effect on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Other than related to the site discussed below, any possible loss or range of potential loss that may be incurred in excess of the recorded accruals cannot be estimated. As part of the above, from December 31, 1956 through June 1967, the Company, via a wholly-owned subsidiary, owned and operated a paper mill located on the shore of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, which is now part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park that is managed by the National Park Service NPS ). The Company and the United States are currently engaged in litigation regarding the site in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (Akron), with the United States claiming that the Company should pay million as a remedy for certain soils at the site as well as its past and anticipated future costs. The Company undertook sampling at the site in 2024 and has proposed settling this matter and has recorded charges of approximately million in the first nine months of 2024 as its best estimate of this liability based on current information. These charges were recorded to Other expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses against this suit, if the proposed settlement is not accepted by the NPS and the lawsuit proceeds, the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in a loss in excess of the amount currently accrued. In November 2023, the Autorita Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (the Italian Competition Authority commenced an investigation into alleged anti-competitive conduct by glass manufacturers and distributors in Italy, including the Company s subsidiary based in Italy, O-I Italy SpA O-I Italy ), and an Italian joint venture in which O-I Italy owns a interest, related to the sale of wine bottles in Italy. The Italian Competition Authority s investigation is ongoing. To date, the Italian Competition Authority has not officially charged O-I Italy or its joint venture with any violations of competition law. If the Italian Competition Authority finds that the Company or any of its subsidiaries or joint ventures violated competition law, the Italian Competition Authority could levy fines, which could be material. At this stage, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the investigation and any potential loss cannot be estimated. Other litigation is pending against the Company, in some cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to the business of the Company and in others presenting allegations that are non-routine and involve compensatory, punitive or treble damage claims as well as other types of relief. The Company records a liability for such matters when it is both probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Recorded amounts are reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes in the factors upon which the estimates are based, including additional information, negotiations, settlements and other events.

Non-U.S. Total income taxes paid in cash Interest paid in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. Cash interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included million of note repurchase premiums. The Company uses various factoring programs to sell certain trade receivables to financial institutions as part of managing its cash flows. Sales of trade receivables are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. Trade receivables sold under the factoring programs are transferred without recourse to the Company and accounted for as true sales and, therefore, are excluded from Trade receivables, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the total amount of trade receivables sold by the Company was million, million, and million, respectively. These amounts included million, million and million at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively, for trade receivable amounts factored under supply-chain financing programs linked to commercial arrangements with key customers. The Company is the master servicer for the factoring programs that are not associated with key customers and is responsible for administering and collecting receivables. The Company s use of its accounts receivable factoring programs resulted in an increase to cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded expenses related to these factoring programs of approximately million and million, respectively. In accordance with ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, the Company has agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating vendors to track the Company s payments and, if voluntarily elected by the vendor, to sell payment obligations from the Company to financial institutions as part of a Supply Chain Financing SCF Program. The Company's payment terms to the financial institutions, including the timing and amount of payments, are based on the original supplier invoices. When participating vendors elect to sell one or more of the Company s payment obligations, the Company s rights and obligations to settle the payables on their contractual due date are not impacted. The Company has no economic or commercial interest in a vendor s decision to enter into these agreements, and the financial institutions do not provide the Company with incentives, such as rebates or profit sharing under the SCF Program. The Company agrees on commercial terms with vendors for the goods and services procured, which are consistent with payment terms observed at other peer companies in the industry, and the terms are not impacted by the SCF Program. Such obligations are classified as accounts payable in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company does not provide asset pledges, or other forms of guarantees, as security for the committed payment to the financial institutions. As of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately million, million, and million, respectively, of outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions as part of the SCF Program.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company s measure of profit for its reportable segments is segment operating profit, which consists of consolidated earnings before interest income, interest expense, and provision for income taxes and excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments, as well as certain retained corporate costs. The segment data presented below is prepared in accordance with general accounting principles for segment reporting. The lines titled reportable segment totals in both net sales and segment operating profit represent non-GAAP measures. Management has included reportable segment totals below to facilitate the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and believes this information allows the Board of Directors, management, investors and analysts to better understand the Company s financial performance. The Company s management, including the chief operating decision maker (defined as the Chief Executive Officer), uses segment operating profit, supplemented by net sales and selected cash flow information, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment operating profit is not, however, intended as an alternative measure of operating results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 regarding the Company s reportable segments is as follows (dollars in millions):

Executive Overview Quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 64 million, or 4 , compared to the same quarter in the prior year, as a result of lower average selling prices and the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency translation, partially offset by slightly higher sales volumes. Loss before income taxes was 57 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to earnings before income taxes of 82 million in the third quarter of 2023. This change was primarily due to lower segment operating profit and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower retained corporate and other costs. Segment operating profit for reportable segments in the third quarter of 2024 was 157 million lower compared to the same quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower net prices (net of cost inflation) and higher operating costs due to significant temporary production curtailment to reduce elevated inventory levels following several quarters of sluggish demand, partially offset by slightly higher shipments in the third quarter of 2024. Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 9 million compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher interest rates. For the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a net loss attributable to the Company of 80 million, or 0.52 per share, compared to net earnings attributable to the Company of 51 million, or 0.32 per share (diluted), in the third quarter of 2023. As discussed below, net earnings (loss) attributable to the Company in both periods included items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments. These items negatively impacted net loss attributable to the Company by 74 million, or 0.48 per share, in the third quarter of 2024 and negatively impacted net earnings attributable to the Company by 75 million, or 0.48 per share, in the third quarter of 2023. Results of Operations Third Quarter of 2024 Compared with Third Quarter of 2023 Net Sales The Company s net sales in the third quarter of 2024 were 1,679 million compared with 1,743 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 64 million, or 4 . Average selling prices decreased approximately 4 which lowered net sales by 72 million in the third quarter of 2024. Glass container shipments, in tons, increased approximately 2 in the third quarter of 2024, which increased net sales by approximately 34 million compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was a result of comparable or higher shipments in all of the Company s geographic markets, except for a decline in southwest Europe. While market conditions remain sluggish, the third quarter of 2024 represented the first year-over-year increase in shipments in seven quarters. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates decreased net sales by 30 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Other sales were approximately 4 million higher in the third quarter of 2024 than in the same period in the prior year, driven by higher machine part sales. The change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 

Reportable segment net sales - 2023 1,714 Price (72) Sales volume and mix 34 Effects of changing foreign currency rates (30) Total effect on reportable segment net sales (68) Reportable segment net sales - 2024 1,646 Americas: Net sales in the Americas in the third quarter of 2024 were 940 million compared to 948 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 8 million, or 1 . Lower selling prices in the region decreased net sales by 6 million in the third quarter of 2024, driven by the pass through of lower cost inflation, especially lower energy costs in North America. Glass container shipments in the region were up nearly 7 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, which increased net sales by approximately 44 million . The increase in sales was driven 

 27 

by higher shipments to all end markets in the quarter, except to spirits customers, which were impacted by lower shipments in Mexico and North America due to continued destocking. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales by 46 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year quarter, as the Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso weakened compared to the U.S. dollar. Europe: Net sales in Europe in the third quarter of 2024 were 706 million compared to 766 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 60 million, or 8 . Lower average selling prices in Europe decreased net sales by 66 million in the third quarter of 2024, driven by the pass through of lower cost inflation, especially lower energy costs. Glass container shipments were down approximately 2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and decreased net sales by approximately 10 million compared to the prior year quarter. Shipments were comparable or higher in all geographic markets in the segment, except for Southwest Europe where the beer category was impacted by poor weather conditions and the wine category remained soft. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased the region s net sales by approximately 16 million in the third quarter of 2024, as the Euro strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar. Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes and Segment Operating Profit Loss before income taxes was 57 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to earnings before income taxes of 82 million in the third quarter of 2023, a change of 139 million. This change was primarily due to lower segment operating profit and higher interest expense in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower retained corporate and other costs. Segment operating profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained corporate costs and other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment operating profit of reportable segments in the third quarter of 2024 was 144 million, compared to 301 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 157 million, or 52 . This decrease was primarily due to lower net prices (net of cost inflation) and higher operating costs. Operating costs were driven higher in the third quarter of 2024 due to lower production volumes driven by temporary curtailments of approximately 18 of the Company s production capacity to rebalance inventory levels in response to several quarters of sluggish demand. Segment operating profit was favorably impacted by slightly higher shipments in the third quarter of 2024 . The change in segment operating profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 

Reportable segment operating profit - 2023 301 Net price (net of cost inflation) (79) Sales volume and mix 11 Operating costs (91) Effects of changing foreign currency rates 2 Total net effect on reportable segment operating profit (157) Reportable segment operating profit - 2024 144 Americas: Segment operating profit in the Americas in the third quarter of 2024 was 88 million, compared to 116 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 28 million, or 24 . The impact of higher shipments discussed above resulted in a 14 million increase to segment operating profit in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Operating costs in the third quarter of 2024 were 17 million higher than in the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating costs was primarily due to lower production volumes, driven by temporary curtailments of approximately 15 of the segment s production capacity to rebalance inventory levels following several quarters of sluggish demand. This was partially mitigated by effective operating and cost management, including approximately 19 million of lower operating costs as a result of the region s restructuring actions taken in 2023 (in line with management s expectations). Lower net selling prices (net of cost inflation) were impacted by cost inflation in Latin 

 28 

America and resulted in a 24 million decrease to segment operating profit in the third quarter of 2024. The effects of foreign currency exchange rates decreased segment operating profit by 1 million in the third quarter of 2024. In order to better match production to customer demand, management has implemented temporary production curtailments in the region. This initiative has resulted in higher operating costs in the third quarter of 2024 due to unabsorbed fixed costs. Temporary production curtailments will continue during the fourth quarter of 2024, and this is expected to increase operating costs. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the permanent closure of five furnaces. The Company will continue to monitor business trends and consider whether any additional indefinite or permanent capacity closures in the Americas will be necessary in the future to align its business with demand trends. Any indefinite or permanent capacity closures could result in material restructuring and impairment charges, as well as cash expenditures, in future periods. Europe: Segment operating profit in Europe in the third quarter of 2024 was 56 million compared to 185 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 129 million, or 70 . The impact of lower shipments discussed above decreased segment operating profit by approximately 3 million. Lower net selling prices (net of cost inflation) were impacted by price adjustments initiated earlier in the year and decreased segment operating profit by 55 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating costs in the third quarter of 2024 were 74 million higher than in the prior year period. Operating costs were impacted in the third quarter of 2024 by lower production volumes, driven by temporary production curtailments of approximately 21 of the segment s production capacity to rebalance inventory levels. The effects of foreign currency exchange rates slightly increased segment operating profit by 3 million in the third quarter of 2024. In order to better match production to customer demand, management has implemented temporary production curtailments in the region. This initiative has resulted in higher operating costs in the third quarter of 2024 due to unabsorbed fixed costs. Temporary production curtailments will continue during the fourth quarter of 2024, and this is expected to increase operating costs. In addition, in October 2024, the Company initiated discussions with its European Works Councils to permanently close several furnaces and eliminate a number of selling, general and administrative positions within the European segment. These discussions are dependent on the relevant country processes and are expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2024 or early 2025. The Company will continue to monitor business trends and consider whether any indefinite or permanent capacity closures in Europe will be necessary in the future to align its business with demand trends. Any indefinite or permanent capacity closures could result in material restructuring and impairment charges, as well as cash expenditures, in future periods. In addition, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused a significant change in the global gas market, resulting in a shift toward liquified natural gas. This transition has increased volatility in the market, as countries seek to diversify their energy sources and reduce dependance on traditional natural gas supplies. The Company s European operations typically purchase natural gas under long-term supply arrangements with terms that range from one to five years and, through these agreements, typically agree on price with the relevant supplier in advance of the period in which the natural gas will be delivered, which shields the Company from the full impact of increased natural gas prices, while such agreements remain in effect. The Company s energy risk management approach is to have coverage of at least 40 of its expected total energy use over a medium-term horizon (approximately two years), where possible. However, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting sanctions, potential sanctions or other adverse repercussions on energy supplies could cause the Company s energy suppliers to be unable or unwilling to deliver natural gas at agreed prices and quantities. If this occurs, it will be necessary for the Company to procure natural gas at then-current market prices and subject to market availability and could cause the Company to experience a significant increase in operating costs or result in the temporary or permanent cessation of delivery of natural gas to several of the Company s manufacturing plants in Europe. In addition, depending on the duration and ultimate outcome of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, future long-term supply arrangements for natural gas may not be available at reasonable prices or at all. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was 87 million compared to 78 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates. 

 29 

Provision for Income Taxes The Company s effective tax rate from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was (33.3) compared to 31.7 for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 differed from the third quarter of 2023 due to a net unfavorable tax rate on restructuring charges and a change in the mix of geographic earnings. Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to the Company For the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a net loss attributable to the Company of 80 million, or 0.52 per share, compared to net earnings attributable to the Company of 51 million, or 0.32 per share (diluted), in the third quarter of 2023. Earnings in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 included items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions): 

Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2024 2023 Restructuring, asset impairment and other charges (83) (81) Legacy environmental charge (1) Gain on sale of miscellaneous assets 1 Net provision for income tax on items above 9 6 Total (74) (75) Executive Overview Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 462 million, or 9 , compared to the same period in the prior year, as the slight benefit of favorable foreign currency translation was more than offset by lower sales volumes and lower average selling prices. Earnings before income taxes were 343 million lower in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower segment operating profit and higher legacy environmental charges, partially offset by lower interest expense and retained corporate and other costs. Segment operating profit for reportable segments in the first nine months of 2024 was 413 million lower compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to lower shipments, lower net prices (net of cost inflation) and higher operating costs. The higher operating costs were primarily due to lower production volumes driven by temporary curtailments of production to balance with lower demand, lower earnings from joint ventures and the non-recurrence of an energy subsidy received in the prior year, partially offset by effective operating and cost management. Net interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 11 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower note repurchase premiums, write-offs of deferred finance fees and related charges, partially offset by higher interest rates. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company recorded net earnings attributable to the Company of 48 million, or 0.31 per share (diluted), compared to net earnings attributable to the Company of 367 million, or 2.31 per share (diluted), in the first nine months of 2023. As discussed below, net earnings attributable to the Company in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments. These items decreased net earnings attributable to the Company by 86 million, or 0.54 per share, in the first nine months of 2024 and decreased net earnings attributable to the Company by 105 million, or 0.66 per share, in the first nine months of 2023.

Results of Operations First Nine Months of 2024 Compared with First Nine Months of 2023 Net Sales The Company s net sales in the first nine months of 2024 were 5,002 million compared with 5,464 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 462 million, or 9 . Lower average selling prices decreased net sales by 125 million in the first nine months of 2024. Glass container shipments, in tons, declined approximately 5 in the first nine months of 2024, which decreased net sales by approximately 341 million compared to the same period in the prior year. This decline resulted from destocking across the value chain, as the Company s customers, distributors and retailers adjusted their inventory management practices to lower levels and soft consumer consumption activity. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company believes that destocking activity has receded in all categories other than spirits which will likely continue through the end of 2024. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by 4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 

Reportable segment net sales - 2023 5,371 Price (125) Sales volume and mix (341) Effects of changing foreign currency rates 4 Total effect on reportable segment net sales (462) Reportable segment net sales - 2024 4,909 Americas: Net sales in the Americas in the first nine months of 2024 were 2,693 million compared to 2,943 million for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 250 million, or 9 . Slightly higher selling prices in the region increased net sales by 13 million in the first nine months of 2024, driven by the pass through of higher cost inflation. Glass container shipments in the region were down approximately 6 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, which decreased net sales by approximately 252 million . The decline in sales resulted from destocking activity, especially related to wine, spirits and beer customers, and soft consumer consumption. The unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes decreased net sales by 11 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in prior year, as the Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso weakened compared to the U.S. dollar. Europe: Net sales in Europe in the first nine months of 2024 were 2,216 million compared to 2,428 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 212 million, or 9 . Lower average selling prices in Europe decreased net sales by 138 million in the first nine months of 2024. Glass container shipments declined by approximately 4 in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to destocking activity, especially related to wine, spirits and beer customers, and soft consumer consumption . Lower shipments in the first nine months of 2024 decreased net sales by approximately 89 million compared to the same period in prior year. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales by 15 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in prior year, as the Euro strengthened compared to the U.S. dollar. Earnings before Income Taxes and Segment Operating Profit Earnings before income taxes were 163 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 506 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 343 million. This decrease was due to lower segment operating profit and higher legacy environmental charges, partially offset by lower interest expense and retained corporate and other costs. Segment operating profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained corporate costs and other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment operating profit of reportable segments in the first nine months of 2024 was 612 million, compared to 1,025 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 413 million, or 40 . This decrease was primarily due to lower shipments, lower net prices (net of cost inflation) and higher operating costs. The higher operating costs were primarily due to lower production volumes driven by temporary curtailments of production to balance with lower demand, lower earnings from joint ventures and the non-recurrence of an energy subsidy received in the prior year, partially offset by effective operating and cost management. The change in segment operating profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 

Reportable segment operating profit - 2023 1,025 Net price (net of cost inflation) (136) Sales volume and mix (63) Operating costs (221) Effects of changing foreign currency rates 7 Total net effect on reportable segment operating profit (413) Reportable segment operating profit - 2024 612 Americas: Segment operating profit in the Americas in the first nine months of 2024 was 296 million, compared to 419 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 123 million, or 29 . The impact of lower shipments discussed above resulted in a 42 million decrease to segment operating profit in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Operating costs in the first nine months of 2024 were 63 million higher than in the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating costs was primarily due to lower production volumes, driven by temporary curtailments of production to balance with lower demand, partially offset by effective operating and cost management, including approximately 50 million of lower operating costs as a result of the region s restructuring actions taken in 2023 (in line with management s expectations). Higher cost inflation slightly exceeded higher selling prices and resulted in a 25 million decrease to segment operating profit in the first nine months of 2024. The effects of foreign currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by 7 million in the first nine months of 2024. In order to better match production to customer demand, management has implemented temporary production curtailments in the region. This initiative has resulted in higher operating costs in the first three quarters of 2024 due to unabsorbed fixed costs. Temporary production curtailments will continue during the fourth quarter of 2024, and this is expected to increase operating costs. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024 the Company announced the permanent closure of five furnaces. The Company will continue to monitor business trends and consider whether any additional indefinite or permanent capacity closures in the Americas will be necessary in the future to align its business with demand trends. Any indefinite or permanent capacity closures could result in material restructuring and impairment charges, as well as cash expenditures, in future periods. Europe: Segment operating profit in Europe in the first nine months of 2024 was 316 million compared to 606 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 290 million, or 48 . The impact of lower shipments discussed above decreased segment operating profit by approximately 21 million. Operating costs in the first nine months of 2024 were 158 million higher than in the prior year period. Operating costs were impacted in the first nine months of 2024 by lower production volumes, driven by temporary production curtailments to balance supply with demand, lower earnings from joint ventures and the non-recurrence of approximately 16 million in subsidies received from the Italian government to help mitigate the impact of elevated energy costs in the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by benefits from effective operating and cost management. Lower net selling prices (net of cost inflation) decreased segment operating profit by 111 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The effects of foreign currency exchange rates decreased segment operating profit by 1 million in the first nine months of 2024. In order to better match production to customer demand, management has implemented temporary production curtailments in the region. This initiative has resulted in higher operating costs in the first three quarters of 2024 due to unabsorbed fixed costs. Temporary production curtailments will continue during the fourth quarter of 2024, and this is expected to increase operating costs. In addition, in October 2024, the Company initiated discussions with its European 

 32 

Works Councils to permanently close several furnaces and eliminate a number of selling, general and administrative positions within the European segment. These discussions are dependent on the relevant country processes and are expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2024 or early 2025. The Company will continue to monitor business trends and consider whether any indefinite or permanent capacity closures in Europe will be necessary in the future to align its business with demand trends. Any indefinite or permanent capacity closures could result in material restructuring and impairment charges, as well as cash expenditures, in future periods. In addition, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused a significant change in the global gas market, resulting in a shift toward liquified natural gas. This transition has increased volatility in the market, as countries seek to diversify their energy sources and reduce dependance on traditional natural gas supplies. The Company s European operations typically purchase natural gas under long-term supply arrangements with terms that range from one to five years and, through these agreements, typically agree on price with the relevant supplier in advance of the period in which the natural gas will be delivered, which shields the Company from the full impact of increased natural gas prices, while such agreements remain in effect. The Company s energy risk management approach is to have coverage of at least 40 of its expected total energy use over a medium-term horizon (approximately two years), where possible. However, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting sanctions, potential sanctions or other adverse repercussions on energy supplies could cause the Company s energy suppliers to be unable or unwilling to deliver natural gas at agreed prices and quantities. If this occurs, it will be necessary for the Company to procure natural gas at then-current market prices and subject to market availability and could cause the Company to experience a significant increase in operating costs or result in the temporary or permanent cessation of delivery of natural gas to several of the Company s manufacturing plants in Europe. In addition, depending on the duration and ultimate outcome of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, future long-term supply arrangements for natural gas may not be available at reasonable prices or at all. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense in the first nine months of 2024 was 252 million compared to 263 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to 37 million in lower note repurchase premiums, write-offs of deferred finance fees and related charges, partially offset by higher interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes The Company s effective tax rate from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 62.6 compared to 25.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 differed from the first nine months of 2023 due to a net unfavorable tax rate on restructuring charges and a change in the mix of geographic earnings. Net Earnings Attributable to the Company For the first nine months of 2024, the Company recorded net earnings attributable to the Company of 48 million, or 0.31 per share (diluted), compared to 367 million, or 2.31 per share (diluted), in the first nine months of 2023. Earnings in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions).

Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2024 2023 Restructuring, asset impairment and other charges (83) (81) Legacy environmental charge (11) Gain on sale of miscellaneous assets 1 Charges for note repurchase premiums and write-off of deferred finance fees and related charges (2) (39) Net provision for income tax on items above 9 15 Total (86) (105) Forward-Looking Operational and Financial Information The Company expects approximately flat sales demand in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, yet short of the Company s expectations earlier this year. For the full year 2024, the Company expects sales volume (in tons) will be down by a low-to-mid single digit percentage compared to 2023. Over a multi-year time horizon, the Company plans to implement a number of initiatives to increase profitability. Initially, the Company will focus on its Fit to Win initiative with the goal of increasing adjusted EBITDA to at least 1.45 billion by 2027. The Company has announced several near-term actions as part of its Fit to Win program. The Company will continue to implement a broad-based production pause during the fourth quarter of 2024 to balance supply with softer demand. Furthermore, the Company has announced the indefinite or permanent closure of approximately 4 percent of capacity to reduce the fixed base of its network. It is now evaluating the closure of at least 7 percent of its capacity by mid-2025 to reduce redundant capacity and begin to optimize its network. And the Company has implemented headcount reduction and other cost savings actions to reduce selling, general and administrative costs significantly as it streamlines the organization. The Company began production at its first MAGMA greenfield plant in Kentucky in the third quarter of 2024. Commissioning should be completed by the end of 2024, and the Company is focused on using MAGMA to deliver meaningful economic profit. Cash provided by operating activities is expected to range between approximately 380 million and 420 million for 2024. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be approximately 550 million. The Company will continue to actively monitor the impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The extent to which the Company s operations will be impacted by this conflict will depend largely on future developments, including potential sanctions or other adverse repercussions on Russian-sourced energy supplies, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. 
 Items Excluded from Reportable Segment Totals Retained Corporate Costs and Other Retained corporate costs and other for the third quarter of 2024 were 31 million compared to 60 million in the third quarter of 2023 and were 104 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 175 million for the first nine months of 2023. These costs decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 primarily due to lower management incentive expense and lower spending. The Company has initiated a strategic review of the remaining businesses in the former Asia Pacific region. This review is aimed at exploring options to maximize share owner value, focused on aligning the Company s business with demand trends and improving the Company s operating efficiency, cost structure and working capital management. The 

 34 

review is ongoing and may result in divestitures, corporate transactions or similar actions, and could cause the Company to incur restructuring, impairment, disposal or other related charges in future periods. Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately 83 million to Other expense, net 81 million) and Equity earnings 2 million) on the Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations, of which 80 million of cumulative charges related to the Fit to Win program. These charges consisted of employee costs, such as severance and benefit-related costs, write-down of assets and other exit costs in the Americas segment 72 million) and Retained Corporate costs and other 11 million). The Fit to Win program expects to reduce redundant production capacity and begin to optimize the network, as well as streamline other cost areas, such as selling, general and administrative expenses. Additional restructuring charges are expected in future quarters. The Company expects that the majority of the remaining cash expenditures related to the accrued employee and other exit costs will be paid out over the next several years. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company implemented several discrete restructuring initiatives and recorded restructuring and other charges of 81 million. These charges consisted of employee costs, such as severance and benefit-related costs, write-down of assets and other exit costs in the Americas segment 77 million), the Europe 1 million) segment and Retained corporate costs and other 3 million). These restructuring charges were discrete actions and are expected to approximate the total cumulative costs for those actions as no significant additional costs are expected to be incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, these charges were recorded to Other income (expense), net on the Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations. The Company expects that the majority of the remaining cash expenditures related to the accrued employee and other exit costs will be paid out over the next several years. Legacy Environmental Charge From December 31, 1956 through June 1967, the Company, via a wholly-owned subsidiary, owned and operated a paper mill located on the shore of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, which is now part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park that is managed by the National Park Service NPS ). The Company and the United States are currently engaged in litigation regarding the site in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (Akron), with the United States claiming that the Company should pay 50 million as a remedy for certain soils at the site as well as its past and anticipated future costs. The Company undertook sampling at the site in 2024 and has proposed settling this matter and has recorded charges of 1 million and 11 million in the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024, respectively, as its best estimate of this liability based on current information. These charges were recorded to Other expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses against this suit, if the proposed settlement is not accepted by the NPS and the lawsuit proceeds, the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in a loss in excess of the amount currently accrued. Gain on Sale of Miscellaneous Assets For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately 1 million on the sale of land and buildings of a previously closed plant in the Americas. Capital Resources and Liquidity On March 25, 2022, certain of the Company s subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement and Syndicated Facility Agreement (the Original Agreement ), which refinanced in full the previous credit agreement. The Original Agreement provided for up to 2.8 billion of borrowings pursuant to term loans, revolving credit facilities and a delayed draw term loan facility. The delayed draw term loan facility allowed for a one-time borrowing of up to 600 million, the proceeds of which were used, in addition to other consideration paid by the Company and/or its subsidiaries, to fund an asbestos settlement trust (the Paddock Trust established in connection with the confirmed plan of reorganization of Paddock Enterprises, LLC Paddock proposed by Paddock, O-I Glass and certain other parties in Paddock s Chapter 11 case. 

 35 

On July 18, 2022, the Company drew down the 600 million delayed draw term loan to fund, together with other consideration, the Paddock Trust. On August 30, 2022, certain of the Company s subsidiaries entered into an Amendment No. 1 to its Credit Agreement and Syndicated Facility Agreement (the Credit Agreement Amendment ), which amends the Original Agreement (as amended by the Credit Agreement Amendment, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement Amendment provides for up to 500 million of additional borrowings in the form of term loans. The proceeds of such term loans were used, together with cash, to retire the 600 million delayed draw term loan. The term loans mature, and the revolving credit facilities terminate, in March 2027. The term loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement Amendment are secured by certain collateral of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Agreement Amendment makes modifications to certain loan documents, in order to give the Company increased flexibility to incur secured debt in the future. At September 30, 2024, the Credit Agreement includes a 300 million revolving credit facility, a 950 million multicurrency revolving credit facility and 1.45 billion in term loan A facilities 1.39 billion outstanding balance at September 30, 2024, net of debt issuance costs ). At September 30, 2024, the Company had unused credit of 1.24 b illion available under the revolving credit facilities as part of the Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024 was 6.37 . The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur certain indebtedness and liens, make certain investments, become liable under contingent obligations in certain defined instances only, make restricted payments, make certain asset sales within guidelines and limits, engage in certain affiliate transactions, participate in sale and leaseback financing arrangements, alter its fundamental business, and amend certain subordinated debt obligations. The Credit Agreement also contains one financial maintenance covenant, a Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), that requires the Company not to exceed a ratio of 2.50x calculated by dividing consolidated Net Indebtedness that is then secured by Liens on property or assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries by Consolidated EBITDA, as each term is defined and as described in the Credit Agreement. The Secured Leverage Ratio could restrict the ability of the Company to undertake additional financing or acquisitions to the extent that such financing or acquisitions would cause the Secured Leverage Ratio to exceed the specified maximum. Failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. In such an event, the Company could not request additional borrowings under the revolving facilities, and all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence and for the duration of a payment event of default, an additional default interest rate equal to 2.0 per annum will apply to all overdue obligations under the Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement and the lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Agreement to become due and payable, this would result in a default under the indentures governing the Company s outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company believes that it will remain in compliance for the term of the Credit Agreement and that its ability to borrow additional funds under the Credit Agreement will not be adversely affected by the covenants and restrictions. The Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) determines pricing under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement is, at the Company s option, the Base Rate, Term SOFR or, for non-U.S. dollar borrowings only, the Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is linked to the Total Leverage Ratio. The margins range from 1.00 to 2.25 for Term SOFR loans and Eurocurrency Rate loans and from 0.00 to 1.25 for Base Rate loans. In addition, a commitment fee is payable on the unused revolving credit facility commitments ranging from 0.20 to 0.35 per annum linked to the Total Leverage Ratio. Obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets, excluding real estate and certain other excluded assets, of certain of the Company s domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries. Such 

 36 

obligations are also secured by a pledge of intercompany debt and equity investments in certain of the Company s domestic subsidiaries and, in the case of foreign obligations, of stock of certain foreign subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and certain foreign obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company.

In August 2023, the Company redeemed approximately 108 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875 Senior Notes due 2023. At September 30, 2024, approximately 58 million and 17 million aggregate principal amounts of the 3.125 Senior Notes due 2024 and 5.375 Senior Notes due 2025, respectively, remained outstanding. The Company assesses its capital raising and refinancing needs on an ongoing basis and may enter into additional credit facilities and seek to issue equity and/or debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets if market conditions are favorable. Also, depending on market conditions, the Company may elect to repurchase portions of its debt securities in the open market. Material Cash Requirements There have been no material changes to the Company s material cash requirements at September 30, 2024 from those described in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Material Cash Requirements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash Flows Operating activities: Cash provided by operating activities was 171 million and 437 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities 

 37 

in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to lower net income, partially offset by a lower use of working capital, than in the same period in 2023. Working capital was a use of cash of 359 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to a use of cash of 416 million in the same period in 2023, with both periods reflecting lower accounts payable compared to the preceding year end period. Working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects higher accounts receivable compared to the preceding year end period. The Company s use of its accounts receivable factoring programs resulted in an increase to cash provided by operating activities of approximately 2 million and 1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of accounts receivable factoring, the Company s days sales outstanding as of September 30, 2024 were slightly higher compared to September 30, 2023. In addition, the Company paid a one-time, previously accrued tax settlement of approximately 30 million in the second quarter of 2024. Investing activities: Cash utilized in investing activities was 506 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 457 million of cash utilized by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment was 509 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 465 million in the same period in 2023, driven by higher spending on a new plant that the Company constructed in Bowling Green, Kentucky and several other expansion projects. The Company estimates that its full year 2024 capital expenditures should be approximately 550 million . Financing activities: Cash provided by financing activities was 184 million and 31 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Financing activities included additions to long-term debt of 1,096 million and 1,332 million for the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Financing activities included repayments of long-term debt of 923 million and 1,258 million for the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 30 million of its common stock. The Company paid approximately 13 million and 22 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for finance fees. The Company paid approximately 40 million related to hedge activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company anticipates that cash flows from its opera tions and from utiliza tion of credit available under the revolving credit facilities provided by the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short-term (the next 12 months) and long-term basis (beyond the next 12 months). However, as the Company cannot predict the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and its impact on the Company s customers and suppliers, the negative financial impact to the Company s results cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material. The Company is actively managing its business to maintain cash flow, and it has significant liquidity. The Company believes that these factors will allow it to meet its anticipated funding requirements. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company s analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the financial statements are issued. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, estimates and assumptions are discussed within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Company s reported and expected financial results. 

 38 

There have been no other material changes in critical accounting estimates at September 30, 2024 from those described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Forward-Looking Statements This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Forward-looking statements reflect the Company's current expectations and projections about future events at the time, and thus involve uncertainty and risk. The words believe, expect, anticipate, will, could, would, should, may, plan, estimate, intend, predict, potential, continue, and the negatives of these words and other similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements. It is possible that the Company s future financial performance may differ from expectations due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) the general political, economic and competitive conditions in markets and countries where the Company has operations, including uncertainties related to economic and social conditions, trade disputes, disruptions in the supply chain, competitive pricing pressures, inflation or deflation, changes in tax rates and laws, war, civil disturbance or acts of terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues and weather, (2) cost and availability of raw materials, labor, energy and transportation (including impacts related to the current Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts and disruptions in supply of raw materials caused by transportation delays), (3) competitive pressures from other glass container producers and alternative forms of packaging or consolidation among competitors and customers, (4) changes in consumer preferences or customer inventory management practices, (5) the continuing consolidation of the Company s customer base, (6) the Company s ability to improve its glass melting technology, known as the MAGMA program, and implement it in a manner to deliver economic profit within the timeframe expected, (7) unanticipated supply chain and operational disruptions, including higher capital spending, (8) the Company s ability to achieve expected benefits from cost management, efficiency improvement, and profitability initiatives, such as its Fit to Win program, including expected impacts from production curtailments and furnace closures, (9) seasonality of customer demand, (10) the failure of the Company s joint venture partners to meet their obligations or commit additional capital to the joint venture, (11) labor shortages, labor cost increases or strikes, (12) the Company s ability to acquire or divest businesses, acquire and expand plants, integrate operations of acquired businesses and achieve expected benefits from acquisitions, divestitures or expansions, (13) the Company s ability to generate sufficient future cash flows to ensure the Company s goodwill is not impaired, (14) any increases in the underfunded status of the Company s pension plans, (15) any failure or disruption of the Company s information technology, or those of third parties on which the Company relies, or any cybersecurity or data privacy incidents affecting the Company or its third-party service providers, (16) risks related to the Company s indebtedness or changes in capital availability or cost, including interest rate fluctuations and the ability of the Company to generate cash to service indebtedness and refinance debt on favorable terms, (17) risks associated with operating in foreign countries, (18) foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar, (19) changes in tax laws or U.S. trade policies, (20) the Company s ability to comply with various environmental legal requirements, (21) risks related to recycling and recycled content laws and regulations, (22) risks related to climate-change and air emissions, including related laws or regulations and increased ESG scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders, and the other risk factors discussed i n the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and any subsequently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or the Company s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Any forward-looking statements in this document are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from expectations. While the Company continually reviews trends and uncertainties affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition, the Company does not assume any obligation to update or supplement any particular forward-looking statements contained in this document.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in market risk at September 30, 2024 from those described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, the Company has investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As the Company does not control or manage these entities, its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those maintained with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. SEC regulations require the Company to disclose certain information about environmental proceedings if the Company reasonably believes that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. The Company uses a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Except as disclosed in Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, no such proceedings were pending or contemplated as of September 30, 2024. For further information on legal proceedings, see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Part I of this Quarterly Report and incorporated herein by reference.

Approximately 90 million remained available for purchases under this program as of September 30, 2024. The share repurchase program has no expiration date.
