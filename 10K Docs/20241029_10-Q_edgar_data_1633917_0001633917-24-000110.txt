Our marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values and are recorded as long-term investments on our condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net on our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). Marketable equity securities totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Our non-marketable equity securities are recorded as short-term and long-term investments on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities totaled billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had non-marketable equity securities of million and million, respectively, for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. We account for these equity securities using the equity method of accounting. The remaining non-marketable equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value and we measure these equity investments at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjust for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the Measurement Alternative ). All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, and our share of earnings or losses from investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in other income (expense), net on our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).

 Total 
 (1) As of December 31, 2023, loans and interest receivable, held for sale were valued using a price-based model. The price was the significant unobservable input and was determined based upon certain loan and risk classifications of the portfolio. Low, high and weighted average prices were all , measured in relation to par. 
 (2) Excludes non-marketable equity securities of billion accounted for under the Measurement Alternative for which no observable price changes occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 (3) Consists of ROU lease assets recorded at fair value pursuant to impairment charges that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Beginning with the first quarter of 2024, we measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale using observable inputs, such as the most recent executed prices for comparable loans sold to the global investment firm. Accordingly, loans and interest receivable, held for sale are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 11 Loans and interest receivable for additional information on loans and interest receivable, held for sale. 
 
 We measure the non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable price changes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value based on valuation methods which only include significant inputs that are observable, such as the observable transaction price at the transaction date. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 when we estimate fair value using significant unobservable inputs such as when we remeasure due to impairment and use discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others. 
 
 We evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an ROU asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses on ROU lease assets related to office operating leases are calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data, and the impaired asset is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

months or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of these foreign currency exchange contracts is to help mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into revenue or applicable expense line item in the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign currency exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative instruments with the critical terms of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item; if the critical terms are the same, we conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective. We do not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We report cash flows arising from derivative instruments consistent with the classification of cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging. Accordingly, the cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we estimated that million of net derivative losses related to our cash flow hedges included in AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur and as such, did not reclassify any gains or losses to earnings prior to the occurrence of the hedged transaction. If we elect to discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur, we continue to report the derivative s gain or loss in AOCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which point we also reclassify it into earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives held after we discontinue our cash flow hedges and on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the same financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. 
 
 Net investment hedges 
 
 We use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges and accordingly, the gains and losses on the portion of the derivatives included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in AOCI as part of foreign currency translation. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize them in other income (expense), net on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. The accumulated gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings. The cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a net investment hedge are classified in cash flows from investing activities on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 We have t reclassified any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings for any of the periods presented.

 We closely monitor the credit quality of our consumer receivables to evaluate and manage our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins with initial underwriting and continues through the full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal data, including the consumer s prior repayment history with our credit products where available. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, for interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our models, to plan our collection practices and strategies, and in determining our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable.

 Merchant receivables 
 
 We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through our PayPal Working Capital PPWC and PayPal Business Loan PPBL products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. We purchase receivables related to credit extended to U.S. merchants by a partner institution and are responsible for the servicing functions related to that portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we purchased approximately billion and billion in merchant receivables, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable was billion, and billion, net of the participation interest sold to the partner institution of million and million, respectively. 
 
 Through our PPWC product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for the loan or advance based on the overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant s future payment volume that PayPal processes. Through our PPBL product, we provide merchants access to short-term business financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of the applying business as well as the business owner. PPBL repayments are collected through periodic payments until the balance has been satisfied. 
 
 The interest or fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is extended and is recognized as deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fixed interest or fee is amortized into revenues from other value added services based on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period for PPWC based on the merchant s payment processing history with PayPal. For PPWC, there is a general requirement that at least of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every days. We calculate the repayment rate of the merchant s future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within to months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volumes. For PPBL, we receive fixed periodic payments over the contractual term of the loan, which generally ranges from to months. 
 
 We actively monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected or contractual repayment period, as well as the credit quality of our merchant loans and advances that we extend or purchase, so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, risk models developed internally which utilize information obtained from multiple internal and external data sources to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fee. Primary drivers of the models include the merchant s annual payment volume, payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with PayPal s credit products where available, information sourced from consumer and business credit bureau reports, and other information obtained during the application process. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making (or, in the U.S., to assist the partner institution in making) ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our internal models, to plan our collection strategies, and in determining our allowance for these loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable.

Our Purchase Protection Program provides protection to consumers for qualifying purchases by reimbursing the consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does not arrive or does not match the seller s description. Our Seller Protection Programs provide protection to merchants against claims that a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims that an item was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the payment on eligible sales. These protection programs are considered assurance-type warranties under applicable accounting standards for which we estimate and record associated costs in transaction and credit losses during the period the payment transaction is completed. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for transaction losses was million and million, respectively. The allowance for negative customer balances was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 
 
 THE COMPANY 
 
 We are a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and personalizes commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal s mission is to revolutionize commerce globally by creating innovative experiences that are designed to make moving money, selling, and shopping simple, personalized, and secure. 
 
 Regulatory environment 
 We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers. 
 
 Cybersecurity and information security 
 Cybersecurity and information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and other security incidents, and enable us to effectively respond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity incidents and remain subject to these risks. There can be no assurance that our security measures will provide sufficient protection or security to prevent breaches or attacks. For additional information regarding our cybersecurity and information security risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below (if applicable) in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
 The broader implications of the macroeconomic environment, including uncertainty around international conflicts such as the Russia and Ukraine conflict, supply chain shortages, a recession globally or in markets in which we operate, higher inflation rates, higher interest rates, and other related global economic conditions, remain unknown. A deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could continue to increase the risk of lower consumer spending, merchant and consumer bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, higher credit losses, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, or other business interruption, which may adversely impact our business. If these conditions continue or worsen, they could adversely impact our future financial and operating results.

 THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 
 Net revenues increased 429 million, or 6 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year driven primarily by growth in total payment volume TPV , as defined below under Key Metrics of 9 . 
 
 Total operating expenses increased 206 million, or 3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to higher transaction expense partially offset by a reduction in transaction and credit losses. 
 
 Operating income increased 223 million, or 19 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due to net revenues growing more than operating expenses. Our operating margin was 18 and 16 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting the positive impact of lower transaction and credit losses. 
 
 Net income decreased 10 million, or 1 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due to the previously discussed increase in operating income of 223 million, partially offset by a decrease in other income (expense), net of 153 million driven primarily by net losses on strategic investments in the current period compared to net gains in the prior period and an increase in income tax expense of 80 million due primarily to higher income before taxes, changes in jurisdictional mix of income, and U.S. income taxed at different rates. 
 
 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 
 Net revenues increased 1.7 billion, or 8 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year driven primarily by growth in TPV of 11 . 
 
 Total operating expenses increased 1.1 billion, or 6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and, to a lesser extent, restructuring and other partially offset by a reduction in transaction and credit losses and customer support and operations expenses. 
 
 Operating income increased 584 million, or 18 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due to net revenues growing more than operating expenses. Our operating margin was 17 and 15 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting the positive impact of operating efficiencies in our business and lower transaction and credit losses, partially offset by the negative impact of an increase in transaction expense.

Net income increased 182 million, or 6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year due to the previously discussed increase in operating income of 584 million partially offset by a decrease of 283 million in other income (expense), net driven primarily by net losses on strategic investments in the current period compared to net gains in the prior period and an increase in income tax expense of 119 million due primarily to higher income before taxes, changes in jurisdictional mix of income, and U.S. income taxed at different rates. 
 
 IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES 
 We have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the United States U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. We generated approximately 42 of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the U.S. in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 43 and 42 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Because we generate substantial net revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded (if applicable) below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q. 
 We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues or operating expenses (as applicable) in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings. 
 
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 (In millions) Favorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact) 
 12 11 Hedging impact (12) 10 Favorable impact to net revenues 
 21 (Unfavorable) favorable impact to operating expense 
 (10) 2 Net (unfavorable) favorable impact to operating income 
 (10) 23 
 
 While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure. 
 
 We also use foreign currency exchange contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses associated with these instruments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated. 
 
 Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to help offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. 
 
 Additionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur. While we have processes in place to mitigate these risks, it is impossible to eliminate the total effects of any possible exposure associated with setting rates on our platform.

KEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS 
 
 KEY METRICS 
 
 TPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics key metrics that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows: 
 
 TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. 
 
 Number of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. 
 
 An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal s platform or services through such third party s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results. 
 
 Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account. 
 
 As our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which may be indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results. 
 
 Our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment. 
 
 We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.

NET REVENUES 
 Our revenues are classified into the following two categories: 
 Transaction revenues : Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We generate additional revenue from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. 
 
 Revenues from other value added services : Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances. 
 
 Net revenue analysis 
 
 The components of our net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions): 

Transaction revenues 
 
 Transaction revenues grew by 413 million, or 6 , and 1.7 billion, or 9 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of the prior year driven primarily by growth in TPV and the number of payment transactions from our Braintree products and services and, to a lesser extent, from our core PayPal and Venmo products and services. Transaction revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also impacted unfavorably by lower net gains from hedging activities as compared to the same period of the prior year. 
 
 As a result of ongoing negotiations with merchants, we expect lower volume and transaction revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025 from our Braintree products and services.

We had active accounts of 432 million and 428 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our total number of payment transactions was 6.6 billion and 6.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 6 . Our total number of payment transactions was 19.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 8 . TPV was 423 billion and 388 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 9 . TPV was 1.2 trillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 trillion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 11 . 
 
 Transaction revenues growth was lower than the growth in TPV in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year due primarily to unfavorable changes in mix from core PayPal products and services and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these unfavorable impacts to transaction revenues growth were partially offset by favorable impact from Braintree products and services. 
 
 Revenues from other value added services 
 
 Revenues from other value added services increased 16 million and 6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due primarily to an increase in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting primarily from higher interest rates and higher customer balances, partially offset by a decline in the revenue share earned from an independent chartered financial institution. Revenues from other value added services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also impacted by lower interest and fee revenue on our loans receivable portfolio driven by a decrease in receivables related to PayPal Business Loan PPBL products.

Transaction expense 
 
 Transaction expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in millions): 
 
 Transaction expense increased by 238 million, or 7 , and 1.3 billion, or 12 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to the increase in TPV of 9 and 11 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as well as unfavorable changes in product mix. 
 
 The decrease in the transaction expense rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to favorable changes in regional mix, product mix, and certain third-party pricing incentives within our core PayPal products and services as well as favorable changes in merchant mix associated with our unbranded card processing volume. 
 
 The slight increase in the transaction expense rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year was attributable to unfavorable changes in product mix with a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing volume, which generally has higher expense rates than our other products and services, largely offset by favorable changes in regional mix, product mix, and certain third-party pricing incentives within our core PayPal products and services. 
 
 For both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 37 of TPV was generated outside of the U.S. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 36 of TPV was generated outside of the U.S. 
 
 Our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions. The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or our consumer credit products.

Transaction and credit losses 
 
 The components of our transaction and credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions): 
 
 Transaction and credit losses decreased by 94 million, or 21 , and 278 million, or 22 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year. 
 
 Transaction losses were 264 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 329 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 65 million, or 20 . Transaction losses were 783 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 915 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 132 million, or 14 . Transaction loss rate (transaction losses divided by TPV) was 0.06 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.08 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in transaction losses and the associated transaction loss rate in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of the prior year was primarily due to higher recoveries and lower losses resulting from fewer fraud events in the current period. 
 
 Credit losses decreased by 29 million and 146 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of the prior year. The components of credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):

 (3) Includes the reversal of allowance associated with reclassification of certain loans to held for sale. 
 
 The provision in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to loan originations during the period partially offset by improvement in credit quality of loans outstanding. The provision in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to loan originations during the period and a deterioration in the credit quality of loans outstanding.

Consumer loan portfolio 
 
 In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to 40 billion of United Kingdom U.K. and other European buy now, pay later loan receivables, consisting of eligible loans and interest receivables, including a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans over a 24-month commitment period (collectively, eligible consumer installment receivables ). As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, loans and interest receivable, held for sale was 471 million and 2.2 billion, respectively, representing the portion of our installment consumer receivables that we intend to sell. 
 
 The consumer loans and interest receivable balance as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.1 billion and 4.2 billion, respectively, net of participation interest sold, representing an increase of 21 . The increase was driven primarily by growth in our installment credit products in Japan and our revolving credit product in the U.K., partially offset by a decline in our installment credit products in Germany due to the forward flow arrangement with the global investment firm as well as a decrease in our interest-bearing installment credit product in the U.S. 
 
 The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance: 
 September 30, 2024 2023 Percent of consumer loans and interest receivable current 
 95.9 95.4 Percent of consumer loans and interest receivable > 90 days outstanding (1) 
 1.7 2.0 Net charge-off rate (2) 
 4.6 7.6 
 (1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable. 
 (2) Net charge-off rate is the annualized ratio of net credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, excluding fraud losses, on consumer loans as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivable balance during the same period. 
 
 The decline in net charge-off rate for consumer receivables at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 was due primarily to the improvement in credit quality of the U.S. interest-bearing installment products. 
 
 In response to declining performance, a number of risk mitigation strategies were implemented in the third quarter of 2023, which reduced originations for our U.S. interest-bearing installment product. In response to changing portfolio performance, we continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters. Changes to such parameters in the second quarter of 2024, combined with enhanced risk monitoring, have resulted in an increase of U.S. interest-bearing installment loan originations back to historical levels. 
 
 Merchant loan portfolio 
 
 We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses, which we refer to as our merchant finance offerings. Total merchant loans, advances, interest, and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.4 billion, reflecting a slight decline of 4 attributable to slowed originations related to our PPBL product in the U.S. mostly offset by an increase in our PayPal Working Capital product portfolio across countries. 
 
 The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance: 
 September 30, 2024 2023 Percent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable current 91.3 86.7 Percent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable > 90 days outstanding (1) 
 2.8 6.6 Net charge-off rate (2) 
 8.3 20.4 
 (1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the original expected or contractual repayment period, as applicable. 
 (2) Net charge-off rate is the annualized ratio of net credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, excluding fraud losses, on merchant loans and advances as a percentage of the average daily amount of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance during the same period. 
 
 The increase in the percent of current merchant receivables and decrease in percent of merchant receivables greater than 90 days outstanding and the net charge-off rate for merchant receivables at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 was due primarily to the improvement in the credit quality of the PPBL portfolio.

In response to declining performance, a number of risk mitigation strategies were implemented throughout 2023, which reduced originations for our PPBL product. In response to changing portfolio performance, we continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters. Changes to such parameters, combined with enhanced risk monitoring, have resulted in an increase in PPBL originations in 2024.

 Customer support and operations 
 
 Customer support and operations expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions): 

Customer support and operations expenses decreased by 47 million, or 10 , and 137 million, or 9 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to a decline in employee-related costs associated with headcount reduction. The decline in customer support and operations expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by a reduction in other costs incurred related to delivery of our products, including warehouses, shipping, and payment devices and a decrease in contractors and consulting costs, partially offset by an increase in card issuance costs and customer onboarding and compliance costs. 
 
 Sales and marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions): 

Sales and marketing expenses increased by 66 million, or 15 , and 32 million, or 2 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year primarily attributable to higher spend on marketing and brand advertising, including the launch of our PayPal Everywhere advertising campaign, partially offset by a decline in employee-related costs. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also attributable to higher revenue share to our partners. 
 
 We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the fourth quarter of 2024 as we continue to invest in brand advertising and marketing campaigns.

Technology and development 
 
 Technology and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions): 

Technology and development expenses remained consistent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year. The slight increase in technology and development expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in contractor and consultant costs offset by a decline in employee-related costs associated with headcount reduction. The slight increase in technology and development expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by increases in cloud computing services utilized in delivering our products and services, amortization expense associated with internally developed software, and software maintenance costs offset by a decline in employee-related costs associated with headcount reduction. 
 
 General and administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions): 

General and administrative expenses increased by 12 million, or 2 , and 48 million, or 3 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to an increase in indirect tax expense and professional services expense. The increase in general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also attributable to a contingency reserve, partially offset by declines in facilities expense and depreciation expense.

Restructuring and other 
 
 Restructuring and other for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions): 

Restructuring and other increased by 24 million and 161 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to streamline operations, focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure. The associated restructuring charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 36 million and 294 million, respectively, and included employee severance and benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense, substantially all of which were accrued for as of September 30, 2024. The estimated reduction in annualized employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce is approximately 575 million, including approximately 155 million in stock-based compensation. We expect to reinvest a portion of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce to drive business priorities. 
 
 For information on the associated restructuring liability, see Note 17 Restructuring and Other in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve cost structure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 3 million and 120 million, respectively. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, which were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 We continue to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset impairment charges of nil in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 18 million and 61 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to exiting certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of right-of-use lease assets and related leasehold improvements. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain of 17 million due to the sale of an owned property. We also incurred a loss of 12 million upon designation of an owned property as held for sale in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 28 million and 92 million, respectively, of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included net loss on sale of loans and interest receivable previously held for sale and fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 15 million and 49 million, respectively, of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value. 
 
 Other income (expense), net 
 
 Other income (expense), net decreased 153 million and 283 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to net losses on strategic investments in the current period compared to net gains in the prior period, partially offset by higher interest income resulting from an increase in cash balances and interest rates year-over-year.

Income tax expense 
 
 Our effective income tax rate was 23 and 18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 23 and 21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases in our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of the prior year were due primarily to changes in jurisdictional mix of income and U.S. income taxed at different rates. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including our customer protection programs, credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third-party sources, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond. 
 
 SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and investments 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents, and investments (1),(2)

 (1) Excludes assets related to funds receivable and customer accounts of 39.2 billion and 38.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (2) Excludes total restricted cash of 1 million and 3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and strategic investments of 1.7 billion and 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were 6.9 billion and 10.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, or 48 and 64 of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2023, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income or the one-time transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Subsequent repatriations to the U.S. will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. 
 
 A significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. Accordingly, not all of our cash is available for general corporate purposes.

 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash paid for income taxes, net was 975 million and 1.1 billion, respectively. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 The net cash used in investing activities of 868 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to purchases of investments of 20.8 billion, purchases and originations of loans receivable of 15.4 billion, purchases of property and equipment of 480 million, and purchases of reverse repurchase agreements of 299 million, partially offset by maturities and sales of investments of 21.2 billion, proceeds from repayments and sales of loans receivable, originally classified as held for investment, of 14.7 billion, and maturities of reverse repurchase agreements of 226 million. From time to time, we enter into reverse repurchase agreements as a form of secured lending primarily to deploy excess cash. 
 
 The net cash provided by investing activities of 1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to proceeds from repayments and sales of loans receivable, originally classified as held for investment, of 21.3 billion and maturities and sales of investments of 16.1 billion, partially offset by purchases and originations of loans receivable of 19.8 billion, purchases of investments of 15.0 billion, changes in funds receivable from customers of 1.0 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of 478 million. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 The net cash used in financing activities of 4.7 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to the repurchase of 4.8 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 771 million, repayments of borrowings from repurchase agreements of 656 million, repayments of borrowings under financing arrangements of 411 million, and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of 271 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by borrowings under financing arrangements of 1.5 billion (including proceeds from the issuance of fixed rate debt in May 2024) and borrowings from repurchase agreements of 656 million. From time to time, we enter into repurchase agreements as a form of secured borrowing primarily to address temporary liquidity needs.

Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 
 
 Foreign currency exchange rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 had a positive impact of 103 million and a negative impact of 95 million, respectively, on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The positive impact on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to the favorable impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the British pound. The negative impact on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Australian dollar, and to a lesser extent, the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen. 
 
 Available credit and debt 
 
 In May 2024, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of 1.3 billion. Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of 11.9 billion in fixed rate debt outstanding with varying maturity dates. 
 
 In February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the Paidy Credit Agreement with Paidy as co-borrower, which provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility of 60.0 billion, which was modified in September 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity by 30.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of 90.0 billion (approximately 633 million as of September 30, 2024). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 90.0 billion (approximately 633 million) and 50.0 billion (approximately 355 million), respectively, was outstanding under the Paidy Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024, no borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Paidy Credit Agreement. 
 
 Other than as described above, there were no significant changes to the available credit and debt disclosed in our 2023 Form 10 K. For additional information, see Note 12 Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Depending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program, or reduce our cost of capital. 
 
 We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution Aggregate Cash Deposits ). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 2.2 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our 2.2 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement. 
 
 Credit ratings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor s Financial Services, LLC, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and Moody s Investors Services, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreements. 
 
 CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS 
 
 Our material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, capital expenditures, and other future obligations. 
 
 Credit products 
 
 Growth in our portfolio of loans receivable increases our liquidity needs and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding for our credit products.

The Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the CSSF has agreed that PayPal s management may designate up to 50 of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund European, U.K., and U.S. credit activities. As of September 30, 2024, the cumulative amount approved by PayPal to be designated to fund credit activities aggregated to 2.0 billion and represented approximately 27 of European customer balances made available for our corporate use at that date, as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to change the designation of amounts of European customer balances for our credit activities, as we deem necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances. 
 
 In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to 40 billion of our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 14.7 billion of loans and interest receivable in connection with this agreement. See Note 11 Loans and Interest Receivable in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 While our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. 
 
 Customer protection programs 
 
 The risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual consumers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rate ranged between 0.06 and 0.08 of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results. 
 
 Stock repurchases 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 4.8 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in June 2022. As of September 30, 2024, a total of approximately 6.1 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our June 2022 stock repurchase program. 
 
 Other considerations 
 
 Our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K, as supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent, superseded below in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces.

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity investment risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities intended to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. 
 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 50 and 59 , respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio (excluding restricted cash and strategic investments) was held in cash and cash equivalents. The remaining portfolio and assets underlying the customer balances that we hold on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in certain jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers. 
 
 Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and available-for-sale debt securities and the fair value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities investment by approximately 76 million and 122 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities resulting from such interest rate changes are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and are realized only if we sell the securities prior to their scheduled maturities or the declines in fair values are due to expected credit losses. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate principal amount of 11.9 billion and 10.6 billion, respectively, in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates. Since these notes bear interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we also had revolving credit facilities of approximately 5.6 billion available to us. We are obligated to pay interest on borrowings under these facilities as well as other customary fees, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Borrowings under these facilities, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 90.0 billion (approximately 633 million) and 50.0 billion (approximately 355 million), respectively, was outstanding under these facilities. A 100 basis points hypothetical adverse change in applicable market interest rates would not have resulted in a material impact to interest expense recorded in the period. For additional information, see Note 12 Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK 
 
 We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and expenses. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the United States U.S. dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. 
 
 We have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts, please see Note 10 Derivative Instruments in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 We use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiaries from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies and net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI. Cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into revenue or expense in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The accumulated gains and losses associated with net investment hedges will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings. 
 
 If the U.S. dollar weakened by a hypothetical 10 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately 627 million and 622 million lower, respectively, before considering the offsetting impact of the underlying hedged item. 
 
 We have an additional foreign currency exchange management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to help offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. 
 
 Adverse changes in exchange rates of a hypothetical 10 for all foreign currencies would have resulted in a negative impact on income before income taxes of approximately 464 million and 417 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of foreign currency exchange contracts. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of September 30, 2024 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 451 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately 13 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2023 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 400 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately 17 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 were applied to monetary assets, monetary liabilities, and available-for-sale debt securities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.

EQUITY INVESTMENT RISK 
 
 Our strategic investments are subject to a variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our strategic investments totaled 1.7 billion and 1.8 billion, which represented approximately 11 of our total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investment portfolio at those respective dates. Our strategic investments include marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. We are required to record all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). As such, we expect volatility to our net income (loss) in future periods due to changes in observable prices and impairment related to our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative. These changes could be material based on market conditions. Additionally, the financial success of our investments in privately held companies is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, private sale, or other favorable market event providing the ability to realize appreciation in the value of the investment. A hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the carrying value of our strategic investments as of September 30, 2024, which could be experienced in the near term, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 171 million to the carrying value of the portfolio. We review our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent purchases and sales of securities, and other publicly available data, for which we assess factors such as the investees financial condition and business outlook, industry performance, regulatory, economic, or technological environment, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investees. 

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 (b) Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The information set forth under Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation and Regulatory Matters in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS 
 
 We are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, future results, and the trading price of our common stock. You should read carefully the following information together with the information appearing in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the United States U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 8, 2024 2023 Form 10-K ), as updated by the information appearing in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC Forms 10-Q ). The following information supplements and, to the extent inconsistent, supersedes some of the information appearing in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 Form 10 K and Forms 10-Q. These risk factors, as well as our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report, should be reviewed carefully for important information regarding risks that affect us. 
 
 CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY RISKS 
 
 Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. 
 
 The techniques used to attempt to obtain unauthorized or illegal access to systems and information (including customers personal data), disable or degrade service, exploit vulnerabilities, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving. In some circumstances, these attempts may not be recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties continuously attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including through hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems (including employees, vendor and partner personnel and customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, multi-factor authentication application access or other sensitive information used to gain access to such systems or facilities. This information may, in turn, be used to access our customers confidential personal or proprietary information and financial instrument data that are stored on or accessible through our information technology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner. This information may also be used to execute fraudulent transactions or otherwise engage in fraudulent actions. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner or that are part of our information technology supply chain, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, may be difficult to detect, and could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems, as well as the systems themselves. 
 
 We believe that hostile actors, who may comprise individuals, coordinated groups, sophisticated organizations, or nation state supported entities may target PayPal due to our name, brand recognition, types of data (including sensitive payments- and identity-related data) that customers provide to us, and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of our security measures, network breaches, and compromise of personally identifiable customer information due to human error, deception, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors, defects, vulnerabilities, or other issues. 
 
 Any cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects.

Table of Contents 

Under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a breach of payment card information stored by us or our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks, including for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, breaches involving customer information for which we have notified, and may notify, regulators, customers and other third parties. These or other cybersecurity breaches and other exploited security vulnerabilities have subjected us and could further subject us to significant costs and third-party liabilities, result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them, or expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations, and significant fines and penalties. While we maintain insurance policies intended to help offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security breaches and other damage to or unavailability of our systems. 
 
 LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS 
 
 Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business. 
 
 Privacy and Protection of Customer Data 
 
 The legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to technologies such as cloud computing, (generative) artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. Any failure or alleged failure by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to customers or with privacy and data protection laws relating to our collection, use, storage, transfer, or sharing of customer data with third parties could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities, other government agencies, our customers or others, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, result in reputational harm, and materially harm our business. Compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may also restrict or limit our ability to provide products and services to our customers. 
 
 PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of Europe Economic Area individuals to the U.S., including Binding Corporate Rules for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses SCCs as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. While PayPal intends to continue to rely on Binding Corporate Rules and SCCs and will evaluate the circumstances under which additional mechanisms, such as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework may be leveraged for transfers of personal data to the U.S., we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions if our approach is deemed to be noncompliant. 
 
 Many jurisdictions in which we operate globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, data privacy legislation or regulations aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights. For example, numerous U.S. states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and retention of their residents personal information. The continued proliferation of privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate is likely to result in a disparate array of privacy rules with unaligned or conflicting provisions, accountability requirements, individual rights, and national or local enforcement powers, which may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs and could lead to unintended consumer confusion. 
 
 Our credit products expose us to additional risks. 
 
 We offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the U.S. and various international markets. The financial success of these products depends largely on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchase and transaction history with PayPal or Venmo and their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our merchant financing offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions, including those related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, issuing bank policies, and other factors.

Table of Contents 

We generally rely on the activities and charters of unaffiliated financial institutions to provide PayPal and Venmo branded consumer credit and merchant financing offerings to our U.S. customers. As a service provider to these unaffiliated financial institutions, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators. In the event of any termination or interruption in a partner bank s ability or willingness to lend, our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant financing products could be interrupted or limited, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another unaffiliated financial institution on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining and maintaining the lending licenses required for us to originate such loans ourselves would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and require us to change our business practices. 
 
 Merchant loans under our U.S. PayPal Working Capital PPWC and PayPal Business Loan PPBL products and certain U.S. installment loan products are provided by a state-chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us, and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans from the state-chartered bank after origination. In June 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency OCC in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called valid-when-made doctrine, which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business. 
 
 We are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans. Further, laws or regulations may limit the assessment of late fees or penalties on certain credit products, which could negatively impact our revenue share arrangement with an independent chartered financial institution with respect to our U.S. consumer credit products. Any deterioration in the performance of loans facilitated through our platform or unexpected losses on such loans may increase the risk of potential charge-offs, increase our allowance for loans and interest receivable, negatively impact our revenue share arrangement (as discussed above), and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations . 
 
 We currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell up to 40 billion of U.K. and European buy now, pay later BNPL loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe) s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans, and in October 2023, we began selling those receivables. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement. 
 
 From time to time, we may consider other third-party sources of funding (including asset sales, warehouse facilities, forward-flow arrangements, securitizations, partnerships or other funding structures) for our credit portfolio or other receivables. The availability of such third-party funding is subject to a number of factors, including economic conditions and interest rates, and there can be no assurance that any such funding arrangements can be obtained on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to fund our credit products or the purchase of the receivables related to our credit products and offerings adequately or in a cost-effective manner, the growth of our credit products and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.

Environmental, social and governance ESG issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. 
 
 Investors, customers, employees, regulators, legislators and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters and related disclosures, including with respect to cybersecurity, data privacy and protection, global talent and climate, and new ESG laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting and diligence requirements. If we are unable to comply with new laws and regulations or changes to legal or regulatory requirements concerning ESG matters, or fail to meet investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, we may be subject to fines, penalties, regulatory or other enforcement actions, and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We may also experience additional scrutiny or criticism from investors, customers, partners, media, government entities, and other stakeholders if they perceive PayPal to not have acted appropriately with respect to ESG matters. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to ESG-related goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected. 
 
 We specifically recognize the inherent physical climate-related risks where we conduct business. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, California, where our headquarters are located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, extreme weather and natural disaster events more frequently, including drought, water scarcity, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts, and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Such events may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations and higher attrition.

ITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 
 In June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. Our stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions including accelerated share repurchase agreements or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate our stock repurchase program at any time without prior notice. 
 
 The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is summarized below: 
 Total number of shares purchased Average price 
 paid per share (1) 
 Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs Approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs (In millions, except per share amounts) Balance as of June 30, 2024
