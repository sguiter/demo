 Capitalized Project Costs 
 The Fund capitalizes project costs, including pre-construction costs, interest expense, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, or construction of a project, while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the asset. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
 Recoverability of Investments in Real Estate and Infrastructure The Fund continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate investments may not be recoverable. Investments in real estate and infrastructure are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, the recoverability of assets to be held and used requires significant judgment and estimates and is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and their eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. The process for evaluating real estate impairment requires management to make significant assumptions related to certain inputs, including rental rates, lease-up period, occupancy, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, growth rates, market discount rates and terminal capitalization rates. These inputs require a subjective evaluation based on the specific property and market. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of impairment charge, if any, or both. Any asset held for sale is reported at the lower of the asset s carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. When an asset is identified by the Fund as held for sale, the Fund will cease recording depreciation

The high watermark is a mechanism that ensures the General Partner only receives an Incentive Allocation if the Fund s value surpasses the highest previous value. This means that if the Fund s value decreases below the high watermark, the General Partner will not receive any Incentive Allocation until the value exceeds the previous high point. The hurdle rate, which is set at , is a minimum rate of return that the Fund needs to achieve before the General Partner becomes eligible for the Incentive Allocation. The General Partner is entitled to an catch-up provision once the hurdle rate is met, which means that once the hurdle rate is surpassed, the General Partner will receive of the profits or gains until they have caught up to their entitled share.

 Overview 
 The Fund was formed on November 1, 2018 and commenced operations on January 21, 2019, and is governed by the Partnership Agreement. The Fund is organized as an open-ended vehicle for the purpose of investing in infrastructure and real estate, through entities that acquire, own, develop or re-develop and operate infrastructure and real estate assets in Opportunity Zones, with the objective of generating returns from capital appreciation and operating income once development of these assets is complete. The Fund s assets under development had plans in place or were developed at the time of the Fund s acquisition that are strategic to each asset achieving current income and appreciation of value. The Fund engages third parties or affiliates of the Manager (also referred to as the development manager to provide development management services, and in consideration the Fund pays development management fees.

 Solar revenue 
 The increase in solar income of 47.2 million and 112.7 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was due to the Fund s solar assets being placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Rental and other property income 
 The increase in rental and other property income of 2.2 million and 10.0 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to increased occupancy at our office property located in Dallas, Texas, which resulted in increased rental income and tenant reimbursements. 
 Management fees to related party 
 Management fees to related party are calculated based on each Limited Partner s Management Fee percentage multiplied by their proportionate share of NAV as of the beginning of the quarter. 
 The increase in management fees of 1.6 million and 4.3 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in NAV driven by additional capital raised. From September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 the Fund accepted an additional 145.7 million in capital contributions.

 Expense reimbursement to related parties 
 The Manager receives reimbursement for performing certain services for the Fund and its subsidiaries. 
 The increase in expense reimbursement to related parties of 95,000 and 777,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to the increased assets at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. With an increase in total assets, the scale of operations and the complexity of managing the assets also increases. This increase in scale generally leads to higher expense reimbursements, as more services performed by the Manager are required. 
 Interest expense and other 
 Interest expense and other also includes amortization of deferred financing costs. 
 The increase in interest expense and other of 364,000 and 1.7 million, respectively,during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to increased borrowings on our notes payable during the period. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist of legal, third-party administrator expenses, audit and tax expenses, banking fees and corporate expenses. 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses of 2.3 million and 3.6 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to increased professional fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was also driven by the increase in total assets at September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023, as further described above. With an increase in total assets, the scale of operations and the complexity of managing the assets also increases. This generally leads to higher administrative expenses, as more resources and personnel are required. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense, net 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization expense, net of 10.3 million and 28.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to depreciation expense on the Fund s solar assets after being placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases in depreciation expense were partially offset by the amortization of the ITC beginning in the first quarter of 2024, as further described in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 Real estate tax 
 Real estate tax during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively consistent compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Solar and property operating expense 
 The increase in solar and property operating expense of 9.2 million and 25.2 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to the increased expenses on the Fund s solar assets after being placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2023, in addition to the acquisition of three properties subsequent to September 30, 2023. 
 Other income 
 Other income was 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while no other income was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or in the same periods in 2023. Other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 2.9 million gain recognized on the ITC, which was generated and sold during the fourth quarter of 2023, as further described in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income consists of amounts received on interest-bearing accounts. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 The increase in interest income of 366,000 and 2.1 million, respectively during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to higher balances in our interest-bearing accounts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gain (loss) on investments in unconsolidated entities 
 Gain (loss) on investments in unconsolidated entities reflect the changes in fair value of the Fund s investments in unconsolidated entities. 
 The gain on investments in unconsolidated entities was 308,000 and 8.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to a loss on investments in unconsolidated entities of 1.3 million and 2.7 million for the same periods in 2023. The change was due to an increase in the valuation of the portfolio assets held by the unconsolidated entities as a result of increased operational performance. 
 Change in fair value of notes payable 
 We have elected the fair value option for our notes payable . Changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 The decrease in the change in fair value of notes payable of 5.7 million and 13.0 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily attributable to an increased valuation of our solar asset subsequent to September 30, 2023, which directly increases the fair value of the Fund s 75.0 million Convertible Note, as further described in Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Note 8 Debt. 
 Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests 
 The net income attributable to non-controlling interests was 637,000 and 696,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of 1.3 million and 3.9 million, during the same periods in 2023. The change was primarily due to the proportional allocation of net income (loss) to the non-controlling interest holder during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 We expect to utilize proceeds from net cash provided by operations and capital contributions to finance our future acquisitions of and additions to investments. The sources of our operating cash flow will primarily be provided by rental income received from current and future leased properties and solar income from infrastructure assets. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds from our continuous private offering of our Units in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, cash flows from our operating assets, and any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future. 
 Our primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments in portfolio entities and other investments, pay our operating fees and expenses (including the Management Fee and Incentive Allocation), pay any distributions that we make to the holders of our units, periodic repurchases under our redemption program, and pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness that we incur. 
 We expect to obtain the liquidity and capital resources that we need over the short and long-term from cash on hand, the proceeds of our private offerings and from any undistributed funds from operations. For additional detail regarding our private offering, see Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Use of Proceeds from Registered Sales of Securities in the Fund s Annual Report 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We currently anticipate that our available capital resources, including the proceeds from our private offering and the proceeds from any financing arrangements we may enter into, when combined with cash flow generated from our operating

 assets, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had fixed and variable rate mortgage loans payable with an outstanding principal balance of 287.6 million and fair value of 294.1 million. The Fund s mortgage notes payable are collateralized by the respective property on which the debt was placed. The mortgage notes payable are nonrecourse, and contain various restrictions and covenants with which the Fund was in compliance as of September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (amounts in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Cash Provided by (Used In) Operating Activities 60,929 (34,588) Net Cash Used In Investing Activities (172,965) (625,031) Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 88,568 225,784 Net Change In Cash And Cash Equivalents And Restricted Cash (23,468) (433,835) 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 380.1 million and 251.4 million, respectively. 
 Cash flows used in operating activities for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily relates to the payment of management fees as well as payments for interest expense, property operating expenses and marketing, legal, tax and accounting fees. These outflows were offset by cash flows provided by operating activities, which includes rental and solar income received and interest income received on our cash-bearing accounts during the period. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily relates to acquisitions and additions to our investments. 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily relates to proceeds from capital contributions and proceeds from notes payable borrowings, offset by distributions paid. 
 
 Related Parties 
 See Note 10 Management Fees, Incentive Allocation and Other Related-Party Transactions for a description of certain transactions and relationships with related parties. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. 
 We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

 Recoverability of Real Estate and Infrastructure Assets 
 As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, investments in real estate and infrastructure are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, the recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the asset s carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. 
 Our process for evaluating real estate impairment requires management to make significant assumptions related to certain inputs, including rental rates, lease-up period, occupancy, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, growth rates, market discount rates and terminal capitalization rates. These inputs require a subjective evaluation based on the specific property and market. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of impairment charge, if any, or both. 
 Acquisitions and Initial Consolidation of VIEs 
 We account for property acquisitions as asset acquisitions. We allocate the purchase price for asset acquisitions, which includes the capitalized transaction costs, and for the properties upon the initial consolidation of VIEs not determined to be a business, on a relative fair value basis to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective relative fair values. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an investment in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date consistent with the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements . Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above- and below-market lease values, above- and below-market solar agreements, and the value of in-place leases. Our purchase price allocations are developed utilizing third-party appraisal reports, industry standards and management experience, developed using valuation techniques consistent with the guidance in ASC 820. There are risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to purchase price allocations. The value allocated to land, as opposed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements, affects the amount of depreciation expense we record. If more value is attributed to land, depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible lease assets and liabilities can be significantly affected by estimates including market rent, lease terms including renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates, carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease-up period, and current market conditions and costs, including tenant improvement allowances and rent concessions. We determine whether any financing assumed is above- or below-market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar types of debt financing with similar maturities. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 Investments in unconsolidated entities, at Fair Value We have elected the fair value option for our other real estate related investments for which such election is permitted, as provided for under ASC 825. Electing the fair value option allows us to record changes in fair value in our consolidated statement of operations. The valuation of the Fund s investments in unconsolidated entities are prepared by third-party valuation firms in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice USPAP ). The fair values of investments are estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an investment in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date consistent with the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements . Investments without a public market are valued based on applicable valuation techniques. Such valuation techniques include discounted cash flow analysis, applying market capitalization rates or earnings multiples to earnings from the investment, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sale negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, consideration of the amount that currently would be required to replace the asset, as adjusted for obsolescence, as well as independent external appraisals. In general, multiple valuation techniques are taken into consideration when measuring the fair value of an investment. However, in certain circumstances, a single valuation may be appropriate, such as during the development phase of the project, where the Cost Method may be most appropriate for construction in progress, with the Comparative Sales Approach applied to the value of the underlying land. Upon completion, the investment would typically be valued utilizing the discounted cash flow DCF and comparative sales approaches. Weighting of the appraisal methods represents an approximation of how marketplace participants would underwrite the investment in current market conditions as of the measurement date.

 The weighting of valuation methodologies occurs in the reconciliation phase of the appraisal process and represents an approximation of how marketplace participants would underwrite the investment in current market conditions as of the measurement date. In the reconciliation process, appraisers weight the various approaches based on the quantity and quality of the data that was available for the analysis, including the number of relevant comparable sales and other data points, as well as the degree to which the appraisers were able to verify them. Appraisers also consider the typical behavior and attributes of the most likely purchasers of the property, including whether they would most likely be local, regional or national in size, and whether they are expected to be investors, owner-users, or partial owner-users. It is up to the appraisers to determine which approaches to value are applicable and what weight to apply to each approach utilized. In arriving at an as-is value, appraisers reflect how market participants would value a property by viewing it as a typical buyer would. For income-producing properties, the income approach, and specifically the DCF analysis, receives primary consideration. Comparable sales are also analyzed as a secondary method, providing indications of reasonable value per square foot as well as cap rates. The Cost Method is relied upon less frequently, but will receive a heavier weighting in situations where the subject asset has been recently developed or is under construction. Ultimately, assuming that there is sufficient data in the market to support the appraisers analysis, all three approaches should broadly support the concluded value, even if the appraisers place primarily weight on one approach in order to mirror investor behavior. 
 Redeemable Partners Capital Redeemable limited partnership units are initially recorded as the contribution amount under redeemable partners capital in the consolidated balance sheets and is subsequently remeasured at the net asset value as determined in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. Net asset value is calculated as U.S. GAAP partners equity adjusted for the redemption value of our limited partnership units. The judgements involved in the valuation are the same as those described above in investments in unconsolidated entities, at fair value . 
 Notes payable We have elected the fair value option for our notes payable pursuant to ASC 825 . The fair value of notes payable is determined by a third-party appraiser who discounts the difference between contract and market debt service cash flows using a market equity yield. The third-party appraiser also considers multiple valuation techniques (e.g., par, prepayment penalty) and applies a reconciliation among relevant methods. The fair value analysis is updated quarterly and reviewed by senior management. The market rate is determined by giving consideration to one or more of the following criteria, as appropriate: (i) interest rates for loan of comparable quality and maturity and (ii) the value of the underlying collateral. 
 CIM maintains a Valuation Committee to oversee the valuation process. The committee is comprised of the Chief Valuation Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, a member of Senior Management and the Chief Compliance Officer of CIM. The Valuation Committee typically obtains a full appraisal on each asset at least annually, and limited scope updates at least quarterly, from a qualified third-party appraiser as part of the valuation process. CIM s valuation policy described above is in place at the time of this filing, but is subject to change in the discretion of CIM. 
 Estimates 
 Many of our accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Any differences of opinion that arise as to assumptions and metrics utilized in the valuation are discussed and resolved through analysis and comparison to published benchmarks and reference to recent market transactions. These estimates are subject to change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. Certain accounting policies, while significant, may not require the use of estimates. The recent accounting changes that may potentially impact our business, if any, are described under Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Pursuant to Item 305 of Regulation S-K, the Fund, as a smaller reporting company, is not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we

Table of Contents 

 recognize that no controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 During the process of preparing the Fund s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified the material weakness described in Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting below. The material weakness resulted in the restatement of previously issued financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023 included in the Fund s Form 10, as amended, and for fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 contained in the Fund s Form 10-Qs. In response to these conditions, management has developed and begun implementing a remediation plan for the related controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). 
 Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. Consistent with the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting remediation plan outlined below, management will monitor and test its Disclosure Controls and Procedures for a sufficient period of time to enable management to conclude on the effectiveness of the controls and procedures. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the process of preparing the Fund s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to a failure to design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyze significant internal and external circumstances and events to enable the identification and assessment of risks of material misstatements. Specifically, the Fund did not design and maintain effective controls to identify that certain business objectives involve substantive activities which are inconsistent with the definition of an investment company under the accounting standards. As a result, the Fund misinterpreted and misapplied investment company accounting standards in its financial statements. The Fund financial statements should have been presented under historical cost and consolidation accounting standards. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 This material weakness resulted in the restatement of previously issued financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023 included in the Fund s Form 10, as amended, and for fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2023 and 2022 and September 30, 2023 and 2022 contained in the Fund s Form 10-Qs. If not remediated, this material weakness could result in further misstatements of account balances or disclosures that could result in additional material misstatements of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 In response to the identified material weakness, management has developed and begun implementing a remediation plan to enhance its internal controls over financial reporting, which generally includes an enhanced risk assessment, additional employee training and implementation of additional control activities. Specifically, as of December 31, 2023, the Fund implemented incremental internal controls specific to historical cost-basis accounting, including, among other things, controls over purchase price allocations, impairments, depreciation and amortization, straight-line rent, and consolidations. 
 While significant progress has been made to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we are still in the process of monitoring and testing these processes, procedures and controls. We believe the above actions will be effective in remediating the material weakness described above. However, the material weakness cannot be considered remediated until controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. As such, we were unable to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
