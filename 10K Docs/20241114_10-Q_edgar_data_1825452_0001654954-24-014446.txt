Exhibits 33 Signatures 34 2 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, assumptions or future events. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, we believe, we intend, may, should, will, could and similar expressions denoting uncertainty or an action that may, will or is expected to occur in the future. These statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the anticipated timing of the development of future products or services; projections of costs, revenue, earnings, capital structure and other financial items; statements of our plans and objectives; statements regarding the capabilities of our business operations; statements of expected future economic performance; statements regarding competition in our market; and assumptions underlying statements regarding us or our business. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to manage our current and projected financial position and estimated cash burn rate, including our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues and capital requirements, and ultimately our ability to continue as a going concern; our ability to raise additional capital or additional funding to further develop and expand our business to meet our long-term business objectives. We have limited revenues and we cannot predict when or if we will achieve significant revenues and sustained profitability; our ability to achieve significant revenues and sustained profitability; impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets; changes in customer demand; our ability to develop our brands cost-effectively, to attract new customers and retain customers on a cost-effective basis; our ability to compete in the markets in which our websites participate; our ability to make strategic actions, including acquisitions and dispositions and our success in integrating acquired businesses; our ability to continue to successfully manage our websites on a combined basis; security breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems; developments and changes in laws and regulations, including increased regulation of our industry through legislative action and revised rules and standards; the occurrence of hostilities, political instability or catastrophic events and wars; our ability to maintain the listing or trading of our common stock and warrants on the NASDAQ Capital Market and the potential impact on our business if we fail to do so; natural events such as severe weather, fires, floods and earthquakes, or man-made or other disruptions of our operating systems, structures or equipment; risks related to, and the costs associated with, environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including the scope and pace of related rulemaking activity; other risks to which our Company is subject; and other factors beyond the Company s control. The ultimate correctness of these forward-looking statements depends upon a number of known and unknown risks and events. We discuss our known material risks under Part I Item 1.A Risk Factors contained in our Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Part II, Item 1.A Risk Factors in this report on Form 10-Q. Many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 3 Table of Contents ITEM 1.

Due to the limited time since the closing of the acquisition, the valuation efforts and related acquisition accounting is incomplete at the time of the filing of these unaudited consolidated financial statements. As a result, the Company is unable to provide amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for major classes of assets and liabilities acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, because the acquisition accounting is incomplete, the Company is unable to provide the supplemental pro forma revenue and earnings for the combined entity, as the pro forma adjustments are expected to primarily consist of estimates for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired and related income tax effects, which will result from the purchase price allocation and determination of the fair values for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management. This information should also be read in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements which are included in our Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024. Overview Onfolio Holdings Inc. acquires controlling interests in and actively manages online businesses that we believe (i) operate in sectors with long-term growth opportunities, (ii) have positive and stable cash flows, (iii) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence and (iv) can be managed by our existing team or have strong management teams largely in place. Through the acquisition and growth of a diversified group of websites with these characteristics, we believe we offer investors in our shares an opportunity to diversify their own portfolio risk. Onfolio Holdings Inc. was incorporated on July 20, 2020 under the laws of Delaware to acquire and develop high-growth and profitable websites. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to "our Company, "we, "our or "us and other similar terms means Onfolio Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation, and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. The first nine months of 2024 reflected significant improvements in our revenue, and net loss. Our cash used in operations for the nine months decreased to 696,715, marking the lowest use of cash for operating activities since our initial public offering in August 2022, compared to 2,160,796 during the same period in 2023. Notably, our net loss roughly halved year-over-year, improving from a net loss of 7,311,359 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (which included an impairment loss of 3,952,516), to a net loss of 1,909,993 in the same period of 2024. In Q3, we saw further gains towards profitability, through increased organic revenue growth, expense reduction, and an acquisition (Eastern Standard, detailed in Recent Developments below) that will contribute to our revenue from Q4 onwards. Quarterly revenue rose 53 year-over-year year, and 16.5 quarter-over-quarter, while total loss from operations decreased to 485,478, down from 4,740,623 in Q3 2023 (which included the impairment loss described above) and 759,119 in Q2 2024. Operational improvements made in Q2 within several portfolio companies yielded substantial cost savings, with impacts most noticeable in August and September 2024. September 2024 marked a milestone with revenues exceeding 700,000 for the first time, and while the net loss for the month was 352,714, non-cash expenses such as amortization made up 346,802 of this loss. Moving into Q4, the acquisition of Eastern Standard will contribute to our consolidated results. We continue to explore organic growth opportunities, operational efficiencies, and further accretive acquisitions assisted by OA SPVs (described in Note 2) and our joint-venture investors. We continue to maintain a strong acquisition pipeline and are actively working towards completing these transactions. Management remains committed to continuous improvement and achieving profitability by focusing on optimizing our financial position and completing accretive acquisitions. Recent Developments In October 2024, we acquired Eastern Standard, a premier digital agency specializing in brand strategy, website development, and digital marketing. Eastern Standard provides tailored solutions across various industries, helping clients enhance their online presence through strategic branding, search engine optimization (SEO), and user-focused design. Our Company holds a 70 ownership stake in Eastern Standard, while the OA SPVs maintain a 20 equity interest, and the Eastern Standard founders maintain a 10 roll-over equity interest and continue to serve in leadership roles on the Eastern Standard team. On September 20, 2024, Eastern Standard LLC Eastern Standard Delaware ), a Delaware limited liability company and the Company s majority owned subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement Eastern Standard Asset Purchase Agreement with Eastern Standard, LLC Eastern Standard Pennsylvania ), a Pennsylvania limited liability company, Mark Gisi, James Keller and Vincent Giordano. Pursuant to the Eastern Standard Asset Purchase Agreement, Eastern Standard Delaware will purchase from Eastern Standard Pennsylvania all of Eastern Standard Pennsylvania s assets utilized in the operation of its business of providing digital marketing services, including integrated branding, and digital customer experiences (the ES Business Assets ). 22 Table of Contents Pursuant to the Eastern Standard Asset Purchase Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, at the closing, Eastern Standard Pennsylvania agreed to sell to Eastern Standard Delaware the ES Business Assets, all as more fully described in the Eastern Standard Asset Purchase Agreement. The aggregate purchase price for the ES Business Assets was 2,160,000. As of the closing, the Company owns 70 of Eastern Standard Delaware in exchange for 1,250,000 payable pursuant to two secured promissory notes which are guaranteed by the Company, and 410,000 of the Company s Series A Preferred Shares. The entities comprising the Company s special purpose vehicle funding program owns an aggregate of 20 of Eastern Standard Delaware in exchange for 500,000 payable in cash. Eastern Standard Pennsylvania owns a 10 roll-over equity interest in Eastern Standard Delaware. The acquisition closed on October 18, 2024. The secured promissory notes consist of: (i) a 400,000 promissory note made by Eastern Standard Delaware in favor of Eastern Standard Pennsylvania with an interest at 8 per annum providing for interest only payments with a balloon payment of principal and interest at the end of one hundred twenty (120) days Short Term ES Promissory Note (ii) an 850,000 promissory note made by Eastern Standard Delaware in favor of Eastern Standard Pennsylvania with an interest rate at 8 per annum providing for interest only payments with a balloon payment of principal and interest at the end of two years ES Promissory Note and (iii) a Guaranty Agreement made by the Company to secure the payment of Eastern Standard Delaware pursuant to the Short Term ES Promissory Note, the ES Promissory Note and the other obligations of the Company and Eastern Standard Delaware under the Eastern Standard Asset Purchase Agreement. Emerging Growth Company We qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are 1.07 billion or more, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors at a portfolio company level: our ability to acquire new customers or retain existing customers and grow revenue; our ability to offer competitive product pricing and control expenses; 23 Table of Contents our ability to broaden product offerings; industry demand and competition; our ability to leverage technology and use and develop efficient processes; our ability to attract and retain talented employees; our ability to identify and acquire companies at reasonable prices and terms; our ability to reduce and control corporate overhead; and market conditions and our market position. Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 The Company reported a net loss of 497,759 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 4,733,159 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The components of the decrease in net loss for the current period are as follows: Revenues For the Quarter Ended September 30, Change from prior Change from prior 2024 2023 Year year Revenue, services 919,044 433,490 485,554 112 Revenue, product sales 1,092,728 879,821 212,907 24 Total Revenue 2,011,772 1,313,311 698,461 53 Revenue increased by 698,461, or 53 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to revenue from our RevenueZen acquisition completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 which increased revenue by approximately 621,000 and our DDS Rank acquisition completed at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which increased revenue by approximately 71,000. This increase was partially offset by a decline in website management revenue, and a decline in digital product sales within the Company s Mighty Deals subsidiary and a decline in revenue from its SEO Butler subsidiary. Cost of Revenue For the Quarter Ended September 30, Change from Change from 2024 2023 prior year prior year Cost of revenue, services 625,676 218,063 407,613 187 Cost of revenue, product sales 180,421 247,533 (67,112 (27 Total Cost of Revenue 806,097 465,596 340,501 73 Cost of revenue increased by 340,501, or 73 due to the Company s recent acquisition offset by the decrease in digital product sales within the Company s Mighty Deals subsidiary. The Company s gross profit margins decreased slightly in the current period compared to the prior period. The components most significant to the Company s cost of revenue are the costs of labor for service fulfillment, content creation, website hosting and maintenance costs and the costs of acquiring new inventory products for physical product sales. 24 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative General and Administrative expenses decreased by 58,267, or 4 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advertising and marketing costs of 88,000, and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 80,000 and decrease in contractor and compensation costs of 84,000, offset by an increase in other general and administrative costs of 44,000, including travel and merchant fees, and an increase in amortization expenses of 147,000 associated with the acquired intangible assets not present in the comparable period. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of consulting related expenses paid to contractors, stock-based compensation, advertising and marketing costs, and other expenses. In the near future, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase to support business growth. Over the long term, we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. Professional Fees and Acquisition Costs Professional fees decreased by 22,471, or 10 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to decreased legal and accounting costs associated with the Company s compliance requirements as a public company. The Company also incurred 18,979 in acquisition costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 77,525 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which included due diligence, audit, legal and other professional fees related to acquisitions and potential acquisitions. We expect acquisition costs to remain significant as we continue to grow based on acquisitions. Other Income and expense Total other expense was 12,281 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other income of 7,464 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income was driven by lower equity method income and decrease in interest income from decreased cash balances. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 The Company reported a net loss of 1,909,993 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 7,311,359 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The components of the decrease in net loss for the current period are as follows: Revenues For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change from prior Change from prior 2024 2023 Year year Revenue, services 2,635,761 1,121,641 1,514,120 135 Revenue, product sales 2,689,512 2,853,447 (163,935 (6 Total Revenue 5,325,273 3,975,088 1,350,185 34 Revenue increased by 1,350,185, or 34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to revenue from our RevenueZen acquisition completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 which increased revenue by approximately 989,000 and our DDS Rank acquisition completed at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which increased revenue by approximately 71,000. This increase was partially offset by a decline in website management revenue, and a decline in digital product sales within the Company s Mighty Deals subsidiary and a decline in revenue from its SEO Butler subsidiary. 25 Table of Contents Cost of Revenue For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change from Change from 2024 2023 prior year prior year Cost of revenue, services 1,549,900 651,849 898,051 138 Cost of revenue, product sales 589,931 916,740 (326,809 (36 Total Cost of Revenue 2,139,831 1,568,589 571,242 36 Cost of revenue increased by 571,242, or 36 due to the Company s recent acquisition, offset by the decrease in digital product sales within the Company s Mighty Deals subsidiary. The Company s gross profit margins remained about the same in the current period compared to the prior period despite the increase in agency service revenue due to the Company s efforts to streamline operations and create efficiencies. The components most significant to the Company s cost of revenue are the costs of labor for service fulfillment, content creation, website hosting and maintenance costs and the costs of acquiring new inventory products for physical product sales. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative General and Administrative expenses decreased by 408,268, or 9 during the nine months September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advertising and marketing costs of 332,000, and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 518,000, offset by a 30,000 increase in other general and administrative costs including travel and merchant fees, an increase in amortization expense of 341,000 associated with the acquired intangible assets not present in the comparable period. Contractor and payroll costs were flat compared to the prior period despite the overall increase in the business, as a result of the Company s efficiency efforts. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of consulting related expenses paid to contractors, stock-based compensation, advertising and marketing costs, and other expenses. In the near future, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase to support business growth. Over the long term, we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. Professional Fees and Acquisition Costs Professional fees decreased by 248,854, or 29 during the nine months September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to decreased legal and accounting costs associated with the Company s compliance requirements as a public company. The Company also incurred 122,266 in acquisition costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 285,532 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which included due diligence, audit, legal and other professional fees related to acquisitions and potential acquisitions. We expect acquisition costs to remain significant as we continue to grow based on acquisitions. Other Income and expense Total other expense was 57,346 during the nine months September 30, 2024 compared to other income of 88,457 during the nine months September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income was driven by lower equity method income and decrease in interest income from decreased cash balances. 26 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 363,244 which was mainly on account of raising capital from sale of common stock and warrants in our IPO of 12,255,470. In addition, the Company has raised 600,000 pursuant to a private offering of Series A preferred stock, 618,000 in notes payable and repaid 2,164,498 on its acquisition notes. Our Company s recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations and our need to raise additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, management and our auditor have concluded that substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited financial statements contained in our Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024 were prepared on a going concern basis, and contemplated the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, and the future operating cash flows of the entity may not provide adequate resources to fund ongoing cash requirements for the next twelve months. If sources of liquidity are not available or if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations during the next twelve months, we may be required to obtain additional sources of funds through additional operational improvements, capital market transactions, asset sales or financing from third parties, a combination thereof or otherwise. We cannot provide assurance that these additional sources of funds will be available or, if available, would have reasonable terms. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. Cash used in operating activities Net cash used in operating activities was 696,715 and 2,160,796 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily from the increase in revenues and decreased general and administrative costs as the Company expanded its operations through its business acquisitions in the past year. Cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was 304,000 and 850,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash used in investing activities was primarily for the purchase of businesses in both periods and additional cost method investments. Cash provided by financing activities Cash flows provided by financing activities was 480,218 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in financing activities of 269,522 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the 2024 period, we received 732,300 in proceeds from notes payable and we paid 234,596 in dividends to preferred stockholders and made payments totaling 238,046 on notes payable. During the 2023 period, we paid 160,563 in dividends to preferred stockholders and made payments totaling 68,959 on notes payable. Critical Accounting Policies The following are the Company s critical accounting policies: Investment in Unconsolidated Entities Equity and Cost Method Investments We account for our interests in entities in which we are able to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, generally 50 or less ownership interest, under the equity method of accounting. In such cases, our original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of earnings, losses and distributions. We account for our interests in entities where we have virtually no influence over operating and financial policies under the cost method of accounting. In such cases, our original investments are recorded at cost and any distributions received are recorded as income. Our investments in OnFolio JV I, LLC JV I ), OnFolio JVII, LLC JVII and OnFolio JVIII, LLC JVIII are accounted for under the cost method. All investments are subject to our impairment review policy. The current investment in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method consists of a 35.8 interest in OnFolio JV IV, LLC JV IV ), which is involved in the acquisition, development and operation of websites to produce adverting revenue. 27 Table of Contents Variable Interest Entities Variable interest entities VIEs are consolidated when the investor is the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the variable interest holder in a VIE with both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Management concluded that the joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities under the requirements of ASC 810. The Company accounts for its investments in the joint ventures under either the cost or equity method based on the equity ownership in each entity. Revenue Recognition The Company primarily earns revenue through website management, digital services, advertising and content placement on its websites, product sales, and digital product sales. Management services revenue is earned and recognized on a monthly basis as the services are provided. Advertising and content revenue is earned and recognized once the content is presented on the Company's sites in accordance with the customer requirements. Product sales are recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer. In certain circumstances, products are shipped directly by a supplier to the end customer at the Company's request. The Company determined that it is the primary obligor in these contracts due to being responsible for fulfilling the customer contract, establishing pricing with the customer, and taking on credit risk from the customer. The Company recognizes revenue from these contracts with customers on a gross basis. Digital product sales represent electronic content that is transferred to the customer at time of purchase. The Company also earns revenue from online course subscriptions that may have monthly or annual subscriptions. In circumstances when a customer purchases an annual subscription upfront, the Company defers the revenue until the performance obligation has been satisfied. Revenue is recognized based on the following five step model: - Identification of the contract with a customer - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract - Determination of the transaction price - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract - Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation The Company amortizes acquired definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but subject to annual impairment tests. Long-lived Assets Property and equipment are stated on the basis of historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are charged to current operations. In accordance with ASC 360 Property Plant and Equipment, the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair market value. Off-balance sheet arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Contractual commitments The Company has entered into two asset purchase agreements which includes contingent earn-out payments based on specific performance criteria. BWPS Business Acquisition: The Company may be required to pay up to 60,000 to Hoang Huu Thinh, contingent upon the BWPS business meeting certain monthly gross revenue targets within three years from the closing date. No earn-out payments have been made as of September 30, 2024. (See Note 10 for further details.) RevenueZen Acquisition: The Company may be obligated to pay up to 1,869,000 to the sellers of RevenueZen, contingent upon the business achieving a specified gross profit threshold within one year. As of September 30, 2024, no earn-out payments have been made. (See Note 10 for further details.) Also, see Note 11 Subsequent Events for additional contractual commitments. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Not applicable. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that, based on such evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness described below. However, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that, notwithstanding the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Material Weakness in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that exists as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined that we had a material weakness because, due to our small size, and our limited number of personnel, we did not have in place an effective internal control environment with formal processes and procedures, including journal entry processing and review, to allow for a detailed review of accounting transactions that would identify errors in a timely manner. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. Management s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness With the oversight of senior management, management is working towards remediation of these weaknesses in 2024 including addition of accounting personnel and to evaluate and implement procedures that will strengthen our internal controls. While we believe these measures will remediate the material weakness identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, there is no assurance that we will demonstrate sufficient improvement that the material weakness will be remediated. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to diligently review our financial reporting controls and procedures. Changes in Internal Control There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 29 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS . From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS . In addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in this Form 10-Q and in our 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. We have incurred operating losses since our inception and we may continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future. We were incorporated on July 20, 2020, and have conducted operations since May 2019. We have incurred operating losses and experienced negative cash flow since our inception. We incurred a net loss of 8,144,821 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 1,909,993 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses through at least 2024. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from owning and/or managing our online businesses to achieve profitability. We expect to continue to make significant operating and capital expenditures for acquisitions of online businesses, technologies, or other assets and for marketing, working capital and general corporate purposes. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability. We cannot assure you that we will ever achieve profitability. 30 Table of Contents Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As described in Note 3 of our audited financial statements contained in our Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024, our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our December 31, 2023 financial statements, expressing substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months after issuance of their report based on our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing, debt financing and/or related party advances, however there is no assurance of additional funding being available. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we cannot raise the necessary capital to continue as a viable entity, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in us. We can provide no assurances that any additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Our forecast of the period of time through which our current financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to support our general and administrative and acquisition activities are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties. If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay or curtail potential website acquisitions, forego sales and marketing efforts, and forego potential attractive business opportunities. Unless we secure additional financing, we will be unable to continue to execute on our business plan. We require additional capital to support our present business plans and our anticipated business growth, and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, which would adversely affect our ability to operate. We will require additional funds to further develop our business plan. Based on our current operating plans, we believe we need to make additional acquisitions of online businesses, technologies, or other assets to generate enough cashflow to carry our overhead costs. We may choose to raise additional capital in order to expedite and propel growth more rapidly. We can give no assurance that we will be successful in raising any additional funds. Additionally, if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from our sales and operating activities, we may need to raise additional funds, doing so through debt and equity offerings, in order to meet our expected future liquidity and capital requirements, including capital required for operations. Any such financing that we undertake will likely be dilutive to current stockholders. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth, including acquiring additional online businesses. In addition, we may also need additional funds to respond to other business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, protecting our intellectual property, satisfying debt and series A preferred stock payment obligations, and enhancing our operating infrastructure. While we may need to seek additional funding for such purposes, we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek to raise additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. We may not be able to negotiate any such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all our business plans. We cannot predict our future capital needs and we may not be able to secure additional financing. We will need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our working capital needs and to fund further expansion of our business. We may require additional equity or debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or funds from other sources for these purposes. No assurance can be given that necessary funds will be available for us to finance our development on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, such additional financings may involve substantial dilution of our stockholders or may require that we relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. In addition, we may experience operational difficulties and delays due to working capital restrictions. If adequate funds are not available from operations or additional sources of financing, we may have to delay or scale back our growth plans. We may not be able to maintain a listing of our common stock and publicly-traded warrants on Nasdaq. Although our common stock and publicly-traded warrants are listed on Nasdaq, we must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain such listing. If we violate Nasdaq s listing requirements, or if we fail to meet any of Nasdaq s listing standards, our common stock and publicly-traded warrants may be delisted. In addition, our board of directors may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our common stock and publicly-traded warrants from Nasdaq may materially impair our shareholders ability to buy and sell our common stock and publicly-traded warrants and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock and warrants. The delisting of our common stock and publicly-traded warrants could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and the value of your investment. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 2.
