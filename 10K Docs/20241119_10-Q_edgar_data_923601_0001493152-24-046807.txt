NASDAQ
has advised the Company that it will continue to monitor the Company s ongoing compliance with the stockholders equity requirement
and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to delisting. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of approximately and deficit working capital of approximately 
which is not sufficient to fund the Company s planned operations through one year after the date the consolidated financial statements
are issued. The Company has a recent history of recurring operating losses and decreases in working capital. These factors create substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the date that the Company s
audited consolidated financial statements are issued. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company
will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in
the ordinary course of business. 

Management
intends to finance operations with future debt or equity financings, however, if and when such financings may occur are uncertain. 

In
making this assessment management performed a comprehensive analysis of the Company s current circumstances including: its financial
position, cash flow and cash usage forecasts, and obligations and debts. Although management has a recent history of successful capital
raises, the analysis used to determine the Company s ability as a going concern does not include cash sources outside the Company s
direct control that management expects to be available within the next 12 months.

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
Sales 

Net
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to approximately 10,622,000 from approximately 15,931,000 representing
a decrease of approximately 5,309,000 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower
overall sell-through results during the prior year holiday season, mostly with our largest customer, Walmart, which in turn reduced their
forecast for the upcoming holiday season resulting in decreased stock purchases. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to approximately 2,375,000 from approximately 3,734,000 representing
a decrease of approximately 1,359,000 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily
due to the decrease in net sales as described above. 

25 

Operating
Expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses decreased to approximately 1,118,000, compared to approximately
 3,628,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This represents a decrease in total operating expenses of approximately
 2,510,000 from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company wrote off the remaining operating lease liability on the hospitality
Lease Agreement due to a termination Settlement Agreement and recognized a gain on early termination of the operating lease of approximately
 3,874,000 as the related right of use asset had already been written off as impaired in the previous quarter. Selling expenses decreased
by approximately 516,000 of variable and discretionary selling expenses commensurate with the decrease in net sales as described above.
These decreases in operating expenses were offset by increases in stock-based consulting expenses of approximately 426,000 and increased
third-party logistics costs of approximately 213,000 associated with the closing of the Company s logistics warehouse in the prior
year. In addition, there was an increase in operating expenses of approximately 816,000 related to the asset acquisition agreement of
SemiCab. 

Other
Expenses (Income) 

Other
expenses consisted of interest expense of approximately 283,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to interest
expense of approximately 53,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense of approximately 230,000
was primarily due to interest incurred on debt from the recently acquired asset purchase of SemiCab. There was a gain on the disposal
of warehouse equipment of approximately 44,000 associated with the closing of the logistics facility in California during the three
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Income
Taxes 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company did not recognize any income tax provision. The Company is not recognizing
any tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as the Company is not forecasting any taxable income for the current
year and had a loss before income tax benefit in the previous year. The Company s income tax expense differs for the expected tax
benefit based on statutory rates primarily due history of losses and forecasts that suggest the Company will not be able to utilize any
deferred tax assets in the future. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
Sales 

Net
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to approximately 15,488,000 from approximately 21,939,000 representing
a decrease of approximately 6,451,000 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower
overall sell-through results during the prior year holiday season, mostly with our largest customer, Walmart, which in turn reduced their
forecast for the upcoming holiday season resulting in decreased stock purchases. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to approximately 3,201,000 from approximately 5,357,000 representing
a decrease of approximately 2,156,000 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily
due to the decrease in net sales as described above. Gross margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 20.7 , as compared
to 24.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason for the decrease in gross profit margin was due to a product
mix of excess inventory that was sold at margins significantly lower than current active products. 

26 

Operating
Expenses 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses increased to approximately 10,386,000 compared to approximately 9,829,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This represents an increase in total operating expenses of approximately 557,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock-based consulting
expenses of approximately 426,000 and an increase in operating expenses of approximately 816,000 related to the asset acquisition agreement
of SemiCab. These increases were offset by a decrease in variable and discretionary selling expenses of approximately 596,000 commensurate
with the decrease in net sales as described above. 

Other
(Expenses) Income, net 

Other
expenses, net increased to approximately 328,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other income, net of approximately
 626,000. 

There
was interest expense of approximately 328,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to interest expense of approximately
 122,000. The increase in interest expense of approximately 206,000 was primarily due to interest incurred on debt from the recently
acquired asset purchase of SemiCab. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was a refund of approximately 704,000 from
the Employee Retention Credit program and a gain on the disposal of warehouse equipment of approximately 44,000 associated with the
closing of the logistics facility in California. 

Income
Taxes 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not recognize any income tax provision as the Company is not forecasting any
taxable income for the current year. The Company s income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was approximately
 1,502,000 as the Company recognized a full valuation allowance on all of its deferred tax assets based on the recent history of losses
and forecasts that suggested the Company would not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets in the future. The Company s income
tax expense differs for the expected tax benefit/expense based on statutory rates primarily due to full valuation allowance for all of
its subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company incurred a net loss of approximately 7,247,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and has a history of recurring
losses. 

On
September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of approximately 621,000 as compared to approximately 6,703,000 on December 31, 2023. The decrease
in cash on hand of approximately 6,082,000 from December 31, 2023, was primarily due to approximately 7,069,000 used in operations.
We advanced approximately 776,000 to SMCB for prepaid services under a service agreement (See Note 5). There was a decrease in refunds
due to customers of approximately 1,968,000 which included payment of approximately 768,000 to one major customer for refunds due for
overstock returned by the customer in the prior year. There was a seasonal increase in reserves for sales returns of approximately 1,180,000.
These uses of cash were offset by proceeds of approximately 1,489,000 for the sale of its common stock and a decrease in trade and related
party accounts receivable of approximately 3,158,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had deficit working capital of approximately 2,082,000. 

On
September 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of approximately 3,213,000 as compared to 2,795,000 as of December 31, 2022. The increase
in cash on hand of approximately 418,000 was primarily due to approximately 760,000 provided by operating activities primarily due
to peak seasonal increases of accounts payable of approximately 10,442,000 primarily due to factory vendors offset by seasonal
increases in accounts receivable of approximately 3,982,000, inventories or approximately 3,424,000 accrued expenses related to
seasonal accruals for estimated returned goods and co-op incentive program expenses, approximately 1,132,000. Net cash used
investing activities for the purchase of molds and tooling was approximately 163,000. Net cash used in financing activities was
approximately 234,000. While the Company received proceeds from the exercise of common stock warrants and issuance of common stock
(net of offering costs) of approximately 1,640,000, this increase in financing activities was offset by repayment of revolving
credit lines of credit and other debt of approximately 1,874,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

27 

As
previously reported on Form 8-K filed on August 30, 2024, on August 26, 2024, the Company received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market
LLC NASDAQ indicating that its stockholders equity as reported in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
period ended June 30, 2024 did not meet the minimum of 2,500,000 in stockholders equity required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1)
(the Equity Rule for continued listing, or the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing
operations. Pursuant to the Equity Rule, the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with the Equity Rule. 

On
November 13, 2024, the Company filed a Form 8-K stating that it believed it regained compliance with the Equity Rule. As disclosed herein,
the Company reported stockholders equity of approximately 2.7 million. 

NASDAQ
has advised the Company that it will continue to monitor the Company s ongoing compliance with the stockholders equity requirement
and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to delisting. 

Based
on cash flow projections from operating and financing activities and the existing balance of cash, management is of the opinion that
the Company has insufficient funds to sustain operations for at least one year after the date of this report, and it may not be able
to meet its payment obligations from operations and related commitments, if the Company is not able to obtain outside financing to allow
the Company to continue as a going concern. Based on these factors, the Company has substantial doubt that it will continue as a going
concern for the twelve months following the issuance date of the financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

The
Company s plan to alleviate the going concern issue is to increase revenue while controlling operating costs and expenses and obtaining
funds from outside sources of financing to generate positive financing cash flows. While management is optimistic about its ability to
raise funds to fund operations for at least one year after the date of this report, there can be no assurance that any such measures
will be successful. 

The
Company s ability to raise additional funds will depend, in part, on the success of our product development activities, and other
events or conditions that may affect the share value or prospects, as well as factors related to financial, economic and market conditions,
many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurances that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on acceptable
terms, if at all. Accordingly, management has concluded that these plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common
stock. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
interim financial statements were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, which require management
to make subjective decisions, assessments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables
and assumptions affecting the judgement increases such judgements become even more subjective. While management believes that its assumptions
are reasonable and appropriate, actual results may be materially different than estimated. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions
have not materially changed from those identified in our Transition Report for the period ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules
and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, with the assistance of other members of our management, have evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

During
our transition period ended December 31, 2023 , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weaknesses described below. 

1. We
 lack sufficient resources in our accounting department restricting our ability to review
 and approve certain material journal entries which increases the likelihood that a material
 misstatement of interim or annual financial statements might not be prevented. Management
 evaluated our current process of review and approval of certain material journal entries
 and concluded this deficiency represented a material weakness. 

2. We
 lack sufficient resources in our accounting department, which restricts our ability to review
 certain material reconciliations related to financial reporting in a timely manner. Due to
 our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and
 may not be economically feasible. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have
 proper segregation between the preparation, review and approval of account reconciliations
 and concluded that this control deficiency represented a material weakness. 

3. Due
 to resource restrictions, we have not established a three-way match of documents or other
 controls precise enough to detect a material misstatement in revenue. Management evaluated
 our current process of determining the occurrence of revenue and concluded this deficiency
 represented a material weakness. 

Planned
Remediation 

We
continue to work on improving and simplifying our internal processes and implement enhanced controls to address the material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting discussed above and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.
We are addressing our accounting resource requirements to help remediate the segregation of duties and plan to implement a concise three-way 
document matching procedure. These material weaknesses will not be considered as remediated until the applicable remediated controls
are operating for a sufficient period and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Despite
the material weaknesses identified above, we believe that the consolidated financial statements included in the period covered by this
report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material aspects, our financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

During
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting.

breach for IT subscription-based services. On March 28, 2020, SemiCab entered into a service contract and agreement with Blue Yonder,
Inc. Blue Yonder for certain IT subscription-based services. The original term of the agreement was for three years,
at a price of 100,000 per year, for a total of 300,000. On June 21, 2023, Blue Yonder filed a lawsuit claiming damages in the
amount of 275,000 with the Maricopa County Superior Court in Arizona Lawsuit ). The suit was found in favor of Blue Yonder

Derivative
Action 

On

largest shareholders, filed a derivative shareholder action in Delaware Chancery Court against the Company, its Directors, and other
Company shareholders (The Stingray Group, Inc. and Regalia Ventures) the Defendants for alleged breach of fiduciary duty
in approving a recent above-market private placement equity transaction. The complaint alleges the Company, and its directors followed
an inadequate process in evaluating the private placement transaction which occurred back in November 2023 and entered into the transaction
with an intent to dilute Ault s ownership stake in the Company. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Based on the
Company s assessment of the facts underlying the claims, the uncertainty of the litigation and the preliminary stage of the case,
the Company cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss that may result from this action.
