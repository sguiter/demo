 (in thousands, unless otherwise noted, except share and per share data) 

a nd , respectively, though, the Company was in compliance with all required covenants as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 . The Company s recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including increasing inflation rates, rising interest rates, foreign currency impacts, declines in consumer confidence, and declines in economic growth. All these factors point to uncertainty about economic stability, and the severity and duration of these conditions on our business cannot be predicted, and the Company cannot assure that it will remain in compliance with the financial covenants contained within its credit facilities. 
 
 In order to continue its operations, the Company must achieve profitable operations and/or obtain additional equity or debt financing. Until the Company achieves profitability, management plans to fund its operations and capital expenditures with cash on hand, borrowings, and issuance of capital stock. Until the Company generates revenue at a level to support its cost structure, the Company expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses and net cash outflows from operating activities. 
 
 Given the economic uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, the Company cannot anticipate the extent to which the current financial market conditions will continue to adversely impact the Company s business and the Company may need additional capital to fund its future operations and to access the capital markets sooner than planned. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital, it may be compelled to reduce the scope of its operations and planned capital expenditures or sell certain assets, including intellectual property assets. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the uncertainty. Such adjustments could be material. 
 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future, and, as such, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. 

Accounting Policies 
 
 The accounting policies the Company follows are set forth in the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2023 . For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Item 8 of the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10 -K. There have been no material changes to these accounting policies.

These arrangements are considered to be sales-type leases, where the present value of all cash flows to be received under the agreement is recognized upon shipment to the customer as lease revenue. Venus Prime, launched in January 2024, is a structured in-house financing program which replaces the legacy subscription program for new customers in North America. 
 
 A financing receivable is a contractual right to receive money, on demand or on fixed or determinable dates, that is recognized as an asset on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company's financing receivables, consisting of sales-type leases, totaled and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and are included in accounts receivable and long-term receivables on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors credit quality over the term of the underlying transactions. 
 
 The Company performed an assessment of the allowance for expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Based upon such assessment, the Company recorded an allowance for expected credit losses totaling and as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively.

Accounts receivable from our Venus Prime program bear interest commensurate with the customer's credit risk. Accounts receivable from our legacy subscription model do not bear interest and are typically not collateralized. The Company performs credit evaluations on new and existing customers' financial condition and maintains an allowance for expected credit losses. Uncollectible accounts are charged to expense when deemed uncollectible, and accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for expected credit losses. Accounts receivable are deemed past due in accordance with the contractual terms of the agreement. Actual losses may differ from the Company s estimates and could be material to its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows.

 The 2024 Investor Warrants (and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the 2024 Investor Warrants) were not registered under the Securities Act and were offered pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements provided under Section 4 (a)( 2 of the Securities Act. The 2024 Investor Warrants are exercisable upon issuance and will expire five years from the issuance date, and in certain circumstances may be exercised on a cashless basis. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver shares of common stock upon the valid exercise of the 2024 Investor Warrants within the prescribed period set forth in the 2024 Investor Warrants, the Company is required to pay the applicable holder liquidated damages in cash as set forth in the 2024 Investor Warrants.

 Under the SPA, no later than March 8, 2024, the Company was required to file a registration statement on Form S- 3 (or other appropriate form if the Company is not then S- 3 eligible) registering the resale of the shares of common stock issued or issuable upon exercise of the 2024 Investor Warrants. The Company was required to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration to become effective within 45 days of the closing date of the Offering (or within 75 days following the closing of the Offering in case of full review of the registration statement by the SEC), and to keep the registration statement effective at all times until no 2024 Investor owns any 2024 Investor Warrants or shares issuable upon exercise thereof.

 2019 Incentive Award Plan 
 
 The 2019 Incentive Award Plan (the 2019 Plan was originally established under the name Restoration Robotics, Inc., as the 2017 Incentive Award Plan.

The 2017 Incentive Award Plan was amended, restated, and renamed as set forth above, and was approved by the Company s stockholders on October 4, 2019.

As of September 30, 2024 , there were shares of common stock available under the 2019 Plan as of December 31, 2023 ).

 The fair value of each option is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula with the following assumptions: 

Risk-free interest rate 

- 

Expected volatility 

Expected dividend rate 

Expected Term The expected term represents management s best estimate for the options to be exercised by option holders. 
 
 Volatility Since the Company does not have a trading history for its common stock, the expected volatility was derived from the historical stock volatilities of comparable peer public companies within its industry that are considered to be comparable to the Company s business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards. 
 
 Risk-Free Interest Rate The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero -coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the stock-based awards expected term. 
 
 Dividend Rate The expected dividend is as the Company has not paid nor does it anticipate paying any dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Fair Value of Common Stock Prior to the Merger, Venus Ltd. used the price per share in its latest sale of securities as an estimate of the fair value of its ordinary shares. After the closing of the Merger, the fair value of the Company s common stock is used to estimate the fair value of the stock-based awards at grant date.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion contains management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q ), with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 Form 10-K and other filings we have made with the SEC. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are an innovative global medical technology company that develops, commercializes and delivers minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic and hair restoration technologies and related services. Our systems have been designed on cost-effective, proprietary and flexible platforms that enable us to expand beyond the aesthetic industry s traditional markets of dermatology and plastic surgery, and into non-traditional markets, including family medicine, and general practitioners and aesthetic medical spas. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a substantial majority of our systems delivered in North America were in non-traditional markets. As we grow our ARTAS hair restoration business and expand robotics offerings through the AI.ME platform we expect our penetration into the core practices of dermatology and plastic surgery to increase. 
 
 We have had recurring net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit o f 300.9 million and 261.9 million, respectively. Until we generate revenue at a level to support our cost structure, we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. In order to continue our operations, we must achieve profitability and/or obtain additional equity investment or debt financing. Until we achieve profitability, we plan to fund our operations and capital expenditures with cash on hand, borrowings and issuances of capital stock. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had cash and cash equivalents of 4.5 million and 5.4 million, respectively. 
 
 The global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced extreme volatility and disruption, including increases to inflation rates, rising interest rates, foreign currency impacts and declines in consumer confidence, and declines in economic growth. All these factors point to uncertainty about economic stability, and the severity and duration of these conditions on our business cannot be predicted. 
 
 On January 24, 2024, the Company announced that the Board has authorized the review of the strategic alternatives with a goal of enhancing stockholder value. There is no set timetable for the strategic review process and there can be no assurance that such review will result in any transaction or other alternative or the terms and conditions of any transaction or other alternative.

 The transactions are discussed in Note 15 "Stockholders' Equity" in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Products and Services 
 
 We derive revenue from the sale of products and services. Product revenue includes revenue from the following: 

the sale, including traditional sales, Venus Prime and legacy subscription-based sales, of systems, inclusive of the main console and applicators/handpieces (referred to as system revenue); 

marketing supplies and kits; 

consumables and disposables; 

service revenue; and 

replacement applicators/handpieces. 

Service revenue includes revenue derived from our extended warranty service contracts provided to our existing customers. 
 
 Systems are sold through traditional sales contracts, through our internal financing programs and through distributors. In the third quarter of 2022 we commenced an initiative to reduce our reliance on system sales sold under subscription agreements in the United States. This strategic shift is designed to improve cash generation and reduce our exposure to defaults and increased bad debt expense given the increasingly challenging economic environment caused by the coexistence of high inflation and high interest rates.

Table of Contents 

We generate revenue from traditional system sales and from sales under our internal lease programs, which are available to customers in North America and select international markets. Approximately 28 of our aesthetic system revenues were derived from our internal lease programs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We currently do not offer the ARTAS iX system under our internal lease programs. For additional details related to our internal lease programs, see Part 1, Item 1. Business as filed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 In January 2024, the Company launched its new Venus Prime program which is a structured in-house financing program replacing its legacy subscription program for customers in North America. Under our Venus Prime program, select customers can qualify for competitive financing rates and continue to benefit from the payment flexibility afforded by our previous subscription financing program when purchasing our aesthetic medical devices, as well as a seamless technology upgrade program made available to our customers in years 2 and 3 of ownership. 
 
 Like our legacy subscription model, Venus Prime includes an up-front fee and a monthly payment schedule, typically over a period of 36 months, with approximately 40 to 45 of total contract payments collected in the first year. To ensure that each monthly payment is made on time and that the customer s system is serviced in accordance with the terms of the warranty, every product purchased under Venus Prime requires a monthly activation code, which we provide to the customer upon receipt of the monthly payment. These recurring monthly payments provide our customers with enhanced financial transparency and predictability. This structure can provide greater flexibility than traditional equipment leases secured through financing companies. We work closely with our customers to provide business recommendations that improve the quality-of-service outcomes, build patient traffic and improve financial returns for the customer s business. 
 
 We have developed and received regulatory clearance for twelve novel aesthetic technology platforms, including our ARTAS and NeoGraft systems. We believe our ARTAS and NeoGraft systems are complementary and give us a hair restoration product offering that can serve a broad segment of the market. Our medical aesthetic technology platforms have received regulatory clearance for a variety of indications, including treatment of facial wrinkles in certain skin types, temporary reduction of appearance of cellulite, non-invasive fat reduction (lipolysis) in the abdomen and flanks for certain body types and relief of minor muscle aches and pains in jurisdictions around the world. In addition, our technology pipeline is heavily focused on improving and enhancing our current technologies, products, and services and the development of robotically assisted minimally invasive solutions for aesthetic procedures that are primarily treated by surgical intervention, including the AI.ME platform for which we received FDA 510(k) clearance for fractional skin resurfacing in December 2022. 
 
 In the United States, we have obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our Venus Viva, Venus Viva MD, Venus Legacy, Venus Versa, Venus Versa Pro, Venus Velocity, Venus Bliss, Venus Bliss Max, Venus Epileve, Venus Fiore, ARTAS, ARTAS iX and AI.ME systems. Outside the United States, we market our technologies in over 60 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Because each country has its own regulatory scheme and clearance process, not every device is cleared or authorized for the same indications in each market in which a particular system is marketed. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we operated directly in 12 international markets through our 10 di rect offices in the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Spain, Germany, Australia, China, Hong Kong, and Israel. 
 
 Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 15.0 million and 17.6 million, respectively. Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 49.1 million and 58.2 million, respectively. We had a net loss attributable to the Company of 9.3 million and 9.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We had a net loss attributable to the Company of 39.0 million and 26.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We had an Adjusted EBITDA loss of 5.9 million and 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We had an Adjusted EBITDA loss of 15.1 million and 14.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as net income (loss) before foreign exchange (gain) loss, financial expenses, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and non-recurring items for a given period. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA along with other financial performance measures, including net income, and our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. We understand that although Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 
 
 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for analyzing the performance of our core business because it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates), the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense), amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense (because it is a non-cash expense) and non-recurring items as explained below.

Key Factors Impacting Our Results of Operations 
 
 Our results of operations are impacted by several factors, but we consider the following to be particularly significant to our business: 
 
 Number of systems delivered. The majority of our revenue is generated from the delivery of systems, both under traditional sales contracts and internal financing programs. The following table sets forth the number of systems we have delivered in the geographic regions indicated:

Mix between traditional sales, distributor sales, and sales made under our internal financing programs. We deliver systems through (1) traditional direct system sales contracts to customers, (2) our internal lease programs, and (3) system sales through distribution agreements. Unit deliveries under direct system sales contracts and internally financed sales have higher per unit revenues and gross margins, while revenues and gross margins on systems sold through distributors are lower. However, distributor sales do not require significant sales and marketing support as these expenses are borne by the distributors. In addition, while traditional system sales and internally financed sales have similar gross margins, cash collections on sales financed under our internal financing programs generally occur over a three-year period, with approximately 40 to 45 collected in the first year and the balance collected evenly over the remaining two years of the agreement. In the third quarter of 2022 we commenced an initiative to reduce our reliance on system sales sold under our internal financing programs in the United States. This strategic shift is designed to improve cash generation and reduce our exposure to defaults and increased bad debt expense given the increasingly challenging economic environment caused by the coexistence of high inflation and high interest rates. 
 
 Investment in Sales, Marketing and Operations. In previous years, we made a strategic decision to penetrate the global market by investing in sales and marketing expenses across all geographic segments. This included the opening of direct offices and hiring experienced sales, marketing, and operational staff. While we generated incremental product sales in these new markets, these revenues and the related margins did not fully offset the startup investments made in certain countries. We continue to evaluate our profitability and growth prospects in these countries and have taken and will continue to take steps to exit countries which we do not believe will produce sustainable results. Since June 2020 we have ceased direct sales operations in 14 countries across Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa and have increased our investment in, and focus on, the United States market. 
 
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and 2023 , respectively, we di d not open an y direct sales offices. 
 
 Bad Debt Expense. We maintain an allowance for expected credit losses for estimated losses that may primarily arise from customers who purchased our products under our internal financing programs who are unable to make the remaining payments required under their agreements. We continue to focus our selling efforts on cash sales and internal financing customers with a stronger credit profile, thereby reducing our exposure to credit losses. We incurred a bad debt expense of 0.4 million and 0.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to 0.3 million and 1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our allowance for expected credit losses was 4.1 million which represents 16.4 of the gross outstanding accounts receivable as of this date. As of September 30, 2023, our allowance for expected credit losses was 12.8 million which represented 27.3 of the gross outstanding accounts receivable as of this date.

Outlook 
 
 The global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced extreme volatility and disruption, including increases to inflation rates, rising interest rates, foreign currency impacts, declines in consumer confidence, and a challenging growth environment. All these factors point to uncertainty about economic stability, and the severity and duration of these conditions on our business cannot be predicted. The bulk of the third quarter revenue decline was due to a significant tightening in credit markets in the U.S. and to a lesser extent international markets due to higher interest rates, impacting our customers' ability and/or desire to secure capital equipment financing. In addition, our international results were negatively affected by an acceleration of our international strategy to wind down underperforming countries as we transitioned to third party distributors. We continue to focus on quality of revenue and despite the revenue decline, our cash used in operations was 4.8 million lower, or 40 , than the same period in 2023. On a positive note, the Federal Reserve Board (Fed), the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Canada all recently reduced interest rates in an effort to reduce the degree of restrictiveness in monetary policy, and signaling future rate cuts over the near term. We remain focused on adapting to the challenges presented by the current macro-economic environment, as well as the opportunities presented by an easing of monetary policy. 
 
 Israel Hamas conflict . Following the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens and the declaration of war that followed, we have taken steps to mitigate exposure to risks related to our Israeli operations, the risks of which are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These efforts include but are not limited to, working with our contract manufacturers to accelerate inventory build, contingency planning with respect to alternative manufacturing sites within their network, and relocating larger amounts of finished goods to warehouses in North America to protect our ability to distribute products. Alongside the Company's continuity plan, we maintain daily contact with our employees in Israel and have instituted a wellness program designed to provide access to healthcare practitioners/consultants for short term counselling for colleagues and family members in order to provide assistance during the conflict. 
 
 Supply chain. We did not experience significant supply issues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we continue to actively work with our suppliers and third-party manufacturers to mitigate supply issues and build inventory of key component parts. We continued to experience some supply challenges in the third quarter of 2024 due to ongoing and intensified geopolitical disruption in the middle east impacting shipping lanes, deliveries of materials and component parts, impacting production lead times that may impact our ability to manufacture the number of systems required to meet customer demand. In addition, since the second quarter of 2021 we have experienced significant inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain, which we expect to continue throughout the rest of 2024. We continue to mitigate such pressures, where possible, through price increases and margin management. 
 
 Global economic conditions. General global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital markets volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdowns, have resulted and may continue to result in unfavorable conditions that negatively affect demand for our products and exacerbate some of the other risks that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Both domestic and international markets experienced significant inflationary pressures in fiscal year 2024. While inflation rates in the U.S., as well as in other countries in which we operate, are showing signs of moderation, the impact of such successive increases on cost structures remains, affecting governments, corporations and small businesses alike. Our customers have also been affected by higher inflation and higher interest rates, impacting their ability to secure third party financing or causing many of them to delay capital purchases due to high interest rates. As noted above, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. and other central banks in various countries have commenced a cycle of interest rate reductions in response to concerns about inflation and stagnant growth. 
 
 Sales markets. We are a global business, having established a commercial presence in more than 60 countries during our history. While the continued post-pandemic recovery remains challenging due to the coexistence of high inflation and high interest rates, we continue to evaluate our direct operations, particularly those outside of North America. 
 
 Accounts receivable collections. We remain fully focused on our revised credit screening practices and thereby reducing bad debt expenses. As of September 30, 2024 , our allowance for expected credit losses stands at 4.2 million, which represents 12.2 of the gross outstanding accounts receivable as of that date. This represents a decrease of 3.2 million or 43 from our December 31, 2023 allowance for expected credit losses balance of 7.4 million. 
 
 Foreign Exchange fluctuations. We are primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues generated outside of the United States denominated in New Israeli Shekels, Euros, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and Mexican pesos. We manage our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. We do not hedge our entire foreign exchange exposure and are still subject to earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange risk. Financial market and currency volatility may limit our ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.

Basis of Presentation 
 
 Revenues 
 
 We generate revenue from (1) sales of systems through our internal financing programs, traditional system s ales to customers and distributors, (2) other product revenues from the sale of ARTAS kits, Viva tips, other consumables, marketing supplies, and (3) service revenue from our extended warranty service contracts provided to existing customers. 
 
 System Revenue 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 23 and 28 , respectively, of our total system revenues were derived from our internal financing programs (Venus Prime and our legacy subscription model). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 31 and 30 , respectively, of our total system revenues were derived from our internal financing programs. Lease program revenues in the first nine months of 2024 have declined compared to the same period in 2023, which is in line with our strategy to prioritize cash deals over internal financing program deals in order to improve cash generation and preserve liquidity. Our internal financing programs are designed to provide a low barrier to ownership of our systems and includes an up-front fee followed by monthly payments, typically over a 36-month period. The up-front fee serves as a down payment. For accounting purposes, our internal financing programs are considered to be sales-type finance leases, where the present value of all cash flows to be received under the agreement is recognized as revenue upon shipment to the customer and achievement of the required revenue recognition criteria. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 61 and 59 , respectively, of our total system revenues were derived from traditional sales. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 61 and 61 , respectively, of our total system revenues were derived from traditional sales. We continue to focus on traditional sales
 in line with our strategy to prioritize cash deals over internal lease program deals in order to improve cash generation and preserve liquidity. 
 
 Customers generally demand higher discounts in connection with traditional sales. We recognize revenues from products sold to customers based on the following five steps: (1) identification of the contract(s) with the customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

31

Table of Contents 

We do not grant rights of return or early termination rights to our customers under either our traditional sales or internal lease programs. These traditional sales are generally made through our sales team in the countries in which the team operates. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 16 and 13 , respectively, of our total system revenues were derived from distributor sales. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 8 and 9 of our total system revenues were derived from distributor sales. The increase in distributor sales as a percentage of total system revenues is in line with the Company's focus of driving international growth through strong distributor partnerships. Under the traditional distributor relationship, we do not sell directly to the end customer and, accordingly, achieve a lower overall margin on each system sold compared to our direct sales. These sales are non-refundable, non-returnable and without any rights of price protection or stock rotation. Accordingly, we consider distributors as end customers, and are accounted for using the sell-in method. 
 
 Procedure Based Revenue 
 
 We generate revenue from the harvesting, site making, and implantation procedures performed with our ARTAS system. The harvesting procedure, as the name suggests, is the act of harvesting hair follicles from the patient s scalp for implantation in the prescribed areas. To perform these procedures, a disposable clinical kit is required. These kits can be large (with an unlimited number of harvests) or small (with a maximum of 1,100 harvests). The customer must place an online order with us for the number and type of kits desired and make a payment. Upon receipt of the order and the related payment, we ship the kit(s), and the customer must scan the barcode on the kit label in order to perform the procedure. Once the kits are exhausted, the customer must purchase additional kits. The site making procedure uses the ARTAS system to create a recipient site (i.e., site making) in the patient s scalp affected by androgenic alopecia (or male pattern baldness). The site making procedure also requires a disposable site making kit. The site making kits are sold to customers in the same manner as the kits for harvesting procedures. The implantation procedure utilizes the same disposal kit that is used for site making and involves immediately implanting follicles into the created recipient site. The implantation kits are sold to customers in the same manner as the harvesting and site making kits. 
 
 Other Product Revenue 
 
 We also generate revenue from our customer base by selling Viva tips, Glide (a cooling/conductive gel which is required for use with many of our systems), marketing supplies and kits, various consumables and disposables, replacement applicators and handpieces, and ARTAS system training. 
 
 Service Revenue 
 
 We generate ancillary revenue from our existing customers by selling additional services including extended warranty service contracts. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 
 Cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs associated with manufacturing our different systems, including direct product costs from third-party manufacturers, warehousing and storage costs and fulfillment and supply chain costs inclusive of personnel-related costs (primarily salaries, benefits, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation). Cost of goods sold also includes the cost of upgrades, technology amortization, royalty fees, parts, supplies, and cost of product warranties. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Selling and Marketing 
 
 We currently sell our products and services using direct sales representatives in North America and in select international markets. Our sales costs primarily consist of salaries, commissions, benefits, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. Costs also include expenses for travel and other promotional and sales-related activities as well as clinical training costs. 
 
 Our marketing costs primarily consist of salaries, benefits, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. They also include expenses for travel, trade shows, and other promotional and marketing activities, including direct and online marketing. As the business environment improves, we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase, but at a rate slightly below our rate of revenue growth. 

32

Table of Contents 

General and Administrative 
 
 Our general and administrative costs primarily consist of expenses associated with our executive, accounting and finance, information technology, legal, regulatory affairs, quality assurance and human resource departments, direct office rent/facilities costs, and intellectual property portfolio management. These expenses consist of personnel-related expenses (primarily salaries, benefits, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation), audit fees, legal fees, consultants, travel, insurance, and expected credit losses. During the normal course of operations, we may incur expected credit losses on accounts receivable balances that are deemed to be uncollectible. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Our research and development costs primarily consist of personnel-related costs (primarily salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation), material costs, amortization of intangible assets, clinical costs, and facilities costs in our Yokneam, Israel and San Jose, California research centers. Our ongoing research and development activities are primarily focused on improving and enhancing our current technologies, products, and services, and on expanding our current product offering with the introduction of new products and expanded indications. 
 
 We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in research, clinical studies, and development activities, but to decline as a percentage of revenue as our revenue increases over time. 
 
 Finance Expenses 

Finance expenses consist of interest income, interest expense and other banking charges. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits. We expect interest income to vary depending on our average investment balances and market interest rates during each reporting period. Interest expense consists of interest on long-term debt and other borrowings. The interest rates on our long-term debt were 8.35 for the MSLP Loan (now owned by Madryn), 13.97 for the Madryn Notes, and 13.60 for the 2024 Notes as of 
 September 30, 2024
 and 8.71 for the MSLP Loan and 14.03 for the Notes as of 
 December 31, 2023
 . 

Foreign Exchange Loss 
 
 Foreign currency exchange loss changes reflect foreign exchange gains or losses related to the change in value of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment is due to the May 2024 exchange of 52.1 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the MSLP Loan Agreement for 17.1 million in aggregate principal of New Secured Notes and 576,986 shares of Series Y Convertible Preferred Stock. As part of the May 2024 extinguishment of principal, the Company recognized a 10.9 million non-cash loss. Additionally, in September 2024 the Company exchanged 15.0 million in aggregate principal of New Secured Notes for 203,583 shares of Series Y Convertible Preferred Stock. As part of the September 2024 extinguishment of principal, the Company recognized a 0.5 million non-cash loss. 
 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 
 
 We estimate our current and deferred tax liabilities based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate. These estimates include judgments about liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes. In certain jurisdictions, only the payments invoiced in the current period are subject to tax, but for accounting purposes, the discounted value of the total subscription contract is reported and tax affected. This results in a deferred tax credit which is settled in the future period when the monthly installment payment is issued and settled with the customer. Since our inception, we have not recorded any tax benefits for the net operating losses we have incurred in each year or for the research and development tax credits we generated in the United States. We believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. Income tax (benefit) expense is recognized based on the actual taxable income or loss incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 
 We have minority shareholders in one jurisdiction in which we have direct operations. For accounting purposes, these minority partners are referred to as non-controlling interests, and we record the non-controlling interests share of earnings in our subsidiaries as a separate balance within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders equity (deficit).

Total revenue decreased by 2.6 million, or 14.8 , to 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributed to the effects of tighter third-party lending practices which negatively impacted capital equipment sales in the U.S. and an acceleration in exiting unprofitable direct markets, partially offset by an improvement in third party international distributor revenues. Despite the challenging credit environment in the U.S. market our focus on quality of revenue continues to have a positive effect on our cash burn rate. Our cash used in operations in the first nine months of 2024 was 40 less than the same period in 2023. 
 
 We sold an aggregate of 253 systems in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 254 systems in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Despite comparable system unit sales, revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were below 2023 revenues for the same period due to a strong recovery in international distributor sales during the quarter, which are sold at lower average selling prices. The percentage of systems revenue derived from our internal lease programs was approximately 23 and 31 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in systems revenues percentage is in line with our strategy to prioritize cash deals over internal financing program deals in order to improve cash generation and preserve liquidity. Specific to the U.S. market, systems revenue derived from our internal lease programs was approximately 24 and 30 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company remains steadfast in ensuring that its in-house financing program accepts only qualified customers in order to minimize future credit losses, often at the expense of topline revenue. 
 
 Other product revenue was 2.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 which remained essentially flat compared to product revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Services revenue was 0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024,compared to 0.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the over all decline in device sales. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 
 Cost of goods sold decreased by 0.3 million, or 6.3 , to 5.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit decreased by 2.3 million, or 18.6 , to 9.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the effects of tighter third party lending practices which negatively impacted capital equipment sales in the U.S., and a decrease in revenue in our international markets driven by the accelerated exit from unprofitable direct markets, partially offset by an improvement in third party international distributor revenues. Gross margin was 66.1 of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 69.2 of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin is attributable to a decrease in U.S. revenues, partially offset by an improvement in international distributor revenues. Our margins on distributor revenues are slightly less than margins in our direct markets.

Selling and Marketing 
 
 Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 0.3 million or 3.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is largely due to lower revenues and reduced activities as we exited unprofitable direct markets, and the effects of tighter third party lending practices which negatively impacted capital equipment sales in the U.S. As a percentage of total revenues, our selling and marketing expenses increased by 5.1, from 39.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 44.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. As the business environment improves, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute terms, but at a rate slightly below our rate of revenue growth. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 1.4 million or 13.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to reduced bad debt expense and savings from exiting certain unprofitable direct markets, lower restructuring costs, partially offset by inflationary pressures associated with salaries and other cost elements. As a percentage of total revenues, our general and administrative expenses increased by 0.8 , from 57.4 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 58.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the decrease in year over year total revenues.

Table of Contents 

Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 0.2 million or 12.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. We experienced cost savings through the consolidation of activities between our Israel and United States sites, partially offset by a reinvestment in research and development efforts directed at scaling our robotic technology across other aesthetic platforms. As a percentage of total revenues, our research and development expenses increased by 0.4 , from 10.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 11.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Loss 
 
 We had 0.1 million of foreign exchange loss in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and foreign exchange loss of 0.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. It decreased by 0.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Changes in foreign exchange are driven mainly by the effect of foreign exchange on accounts receivable balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge against foreign currency risk. 
 
 Finance Expenses 
 
 Finance expenses remained steady at 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 
 
 We had an income tax benefit of 0.03 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 0.3 million income tax benefit in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The tax provision is driven by profitable sales and the actual effective tax rates where the sale took place or losses were incurred. In 2024, we had changes in timing of deductible expenses and tax accrual reversals in specific judications, which resulted in .03 million of income tax benefit.

Total revenue decreased by 9.2 million, or 15.7 , to 49.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 58.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributed to an acceleration in exiting unprofitable direct markets, and an initiative to reduce our reliance on system sales sold under our lease programs, and the effects of tighter third party lending practices which negatively impacted capital equipment sales in both U.S. and international. These initiatives are designed to improve cash generation and reduce our exposure to defaults and increased bad debt expense given the increasingly challenging economic environment caused by the coexistence of high inflation and high interest rates. Despite the reduction in systems sales sold under our lease programs, our cash used in operations decreased by 4.8 million, or 40 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 We sold an aggregate of 790 systems in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 909 systems in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The percentage of systems revenue derived from our internal lease programs was approximately 28 and 24 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The relative increase in lease revenues is attributable to softness in traditional sales primarily due to tighter third party lending practices that had a greater negative impact on our more expensive ARTAS device sales during this period. We remain committed to limiting lease revenues to approximately 30 of total systems revenues, in line with our strategy to prioritize cash deals in order to improve cash generation and preserve liquidity. Specific to the U.S. market, systems revenue derived from our lease programs was approximately 30 and 24 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Other product revenue decreased by 0.1 million, or 0.9 , to 7.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This reduction is in line with the overall revenue decline during the period. 
 
 Services revenue decreased by 0.2 million, or 7.1 , to 2.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was in line with the overall revenue decline during the period. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 
 Cost of goods sold decreased by 2.4 million, or 13.3 , to 15.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit decreased by 6.7 million, or 16.7 , to 33.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to a decrease in revenue in our international markets driven by the accelerated exit from unprofitable direct markets as discussed above and the effects of tighter third party lending practices which negatively impacted capital equipment sales in both the U.S. and international markets, partially offset by an improvement in international distributor revenues during the period. Gross margin was 68.1 of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 68.9 of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The modest decrease is primarily due to an improvement in international distributor revenues during the period, consistent with our strategy to exit certain unprofitable direct markets.

Selling and Marketing 
 
 Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 2.2 million or 9.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is largely due to lower revenues and reduced activities as we exited unprofitable direct markets, and the effects of tighter third party lending practices which negatively impacted capital equipment sales in both the U.S. and international. As a percentage of total revenues, our selling and marketing expenses increased by 2.9 , from 40.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 43 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As the business environment improves, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute terms, but at a rate slightly below our rate of revenue growth. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 3.3 million or 10.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to reduced bad debt expense, savings from exiting certain unprofitable direct markets, lower restructuring costs, partially offset by inflationary pressures associated with salaries and other cost elements. As a percentage of total revenues, our general and administrative expenses increased by 3.2 , from 53.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 56.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the decrease in year over year total revenues.

Table of Contents 

Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 1.3 million or 20.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We experienced significant cost savings through the consolidation of activities between our Israel and United States sites, partially offset by a reinvestment in research and development efforts directed at scaling our robotic technology across other aesthetic platforms. As a percentage of total revenues, our research and development expenses decreased by 0.6 , from 11.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 10.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Loss 
 
 We had 1.2 million of foreign exchange loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and foreign exchange loss of 0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 a variance of 0.8 million year over year. Changes in foreign exchange are driven mainly by the effects of foreign exchange on accounts receivable balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge against foreign currency risk. 
 
 Finance Expenses 
 
 Finance expenses increased by 1.1 million or 23.4 , to 5.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mostly due to an increase in SOFR rates under Madryn New Secured Notes (formerly MSLP Loan Agreement and expense associated with unamortized issuance costs under the MSLP Loan agreement. 
 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 
 
 We had an income tax expense of 0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 0.1 million income tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax provision is driven by profitable sales and the actual effective tax rates where the sale took place or losses were incurred. In 2024, we had changes in timing of deductible expenses and taxable income in specific judications, which resulted in 0.1 million of income tax expense. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We had 4.5 mill ion and 5.4 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We have funded our operations with cash generated from operating activities, through the sale of equity securities and through debt financing. We had total debt obligations of approximately 34.6 million as of September 30, 2024, including the MSLP Loan of 2.7 million, convertible notes of 26.2 million, and a note payable (bridge financing) of 4.4 million compared to total debt obligations of approximately 74.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.3 million, representing a 39.9 reduction compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Working capital is primarily impacted by the ratio of our internal lease program sales (Venus Prime sales and legacy subscription-based sales) to traditional cash sales. Our recent shift to prioritize traditional cash sales over internal lease program sales is designed to improve liquidity and reduce working capital requirements over time. Our expanding product portfolio may require higher inventory levels to meet demand and to accommodate the increased number of technology platforms offered. We had a split of lease program revenue to traditional sales revenue at a ratio of approximately 32:68 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 33:67 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect the ratio of lease program sales to traditional sales in 2024 and beyond to approximate a 30:70 split. We expect inventory to remain relatively flat in the short term but increase at a lower rate than the rate of revenue growth over the longer term. 
 
 We also require modest funding for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to our research and development facilities in Yokneam, Israel and San Jose, California. In addition, our capital investments have included improvements and expansion of our subsidiaries operations to support our growth, but do not expect to incur such costs over the next twelve months. 
 
 Issuance of Secured Subordinated Convertible Notes 
 
 Contemporaneously with the MSLP Loan Agreement, on December 9, 2020, we issued 26.7 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes to the Madryn Noteholders pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement. The Notes accrued interest at a rate of 8.0 per annum from the date of original issuance of the Notes to the third anniversary date of the original issuance and thereafter interest accrued at a rate of 6.0 per annum. In connection with the Exchange Agreement, we also entered into (i) the Madryn Loan and Security Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to grant Madryn a security interest, in substantially all of our assets, to secure the obligations under the Notes and (ii) the CNB Subordination Agreement. The Notes were convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 48.75 per share, subject to adjustment. For additional information regarding the Notes, Exchange Agreement, Madryn Loan and Security Agreement and CNB Subordination Agreement, see Note 11 Madryn Long-Term Debt and Convertible Notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. On October 4, 2023, the Company entered into the 2023 Exchange Agreement with the Madryn Noteholders, pursuant to which the Madryn Noteholders agreed to exchange 26.7 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Notes for (i) 22.8 million in the New Notes, and (ii) 248,755 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock. The New Notes accrued interest, payable in kind on a quarterly basis, at an annual rate of 90-day Adjusted SOFR + 8.5 and are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 24 per share, subject to adjustment. 
 
 Main Street Priority Lending Program Term Loan 
 
 On December 8, 2020, we executed the MSLP Loan Agreement, MSLP Note, and related documents for a loan in the aggregate amount of 50.0 million for which CNB will serve as a lender pursuant to the Main Street Priority Loan Facility as established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.

The 2024 Notes accrue interest at a rate equal to the 90-day adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 8.50 per annum; provided, however, that if there is an Event of Default (as defined below), the then-applicable interest rate will increase by 4.00 per annum. In connection with the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into the EW Security Agreement pursuant to which, the Company granted to the EW Investors a security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the obligations under the 2024 Notes.

Equity Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park 
 
 On June 16, 2020, we entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to 31.0 million of shares of our common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement. The purchase price of shares of common stock related to a future sale will be based on the then prevailing market prices of such shares at the time of sales as described in the Equity Purchase Agreement. The aggregate number of shares that we can sell to Lincoln Park under the Equity Purchase Agreement may in no case exceed the Exchange Cap, unless (i) stockholder approval is obtained to issue shares above the Exchange Cap, in which case the Exchange Cap will no longer apply, or (ii) the average price of all applicable sales of common stock to Lincoln Park under the Equity Purchase Agreement equals or exceeds 59.6325 per share (subject to adjustment) (which represents the minimum price, as defined under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), on the Nasdaq Global Market immediately preceding the signing of the Equity Purchase Agreement, such that the transactions contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement are exempt from the Exchange Cap limitation under applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules). Also, at no time may Lincoln Park (together with its affiliates) beneficially own more than 9.99 of our issued and outstanding common stock. Concurrently with entering into the Equity Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Lincoln Park. The Equity Purchase Agreement expired on July 1, 2022.

 The 2023 Multi-Tranche Private Placement 
 
 In May 2023, we entered into the 2023 Multi-Tranche Private Placement Stock Purchase Agreement, with the 2023 Investors pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell to the 2023 Investors up to 9.0 million in shares of Senior Preferred Stock, in multiple tranches from time to time until December 31, 2025, subject to a minimum aggregate purchase amount of 0.5 million in each tranche.

Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 4.5 m illion. We have financed our operations principally through the issuance and sale of our common stock and preferred stock, debt financing, and payments from customers. 
 
 We believe that the net proceeds from the Madryn Loan and Security Agreement, the Registered Direct Offering, the 2024 Note, the 2023 Multi-Tranche Private Placement, the 2022 Private Placement, the proceeds from issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park, the proceeds from the MSLP Loan, our strategic cash flow enhancement initiatives, our initiatives to pursue strategic alternatives, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We can provide no assurances that we will be successful in raising additional capital or that such capital, if available at all, will be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we may be compelled to reduce the scope of our operations and planned capital or research and development expenditures or sell certain assets, including intellectual property assets. 
 
 Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to: 

delay or curtail our efforts to develop system product enhancements or new products, including any clinical trials that may be required to market such enhancements; 

delay or curtail our plans to increase and expand our sales and marketing efforts; or 

delay or curtail our plans to enhance our customer support and marketing activities. 

We are restricted by covenants in the MSLP Loan, EW Security Agreement, and the Madryn Loan and Security Agreement. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. In the event that the current macroeconomic headwinds continue to cause or present disruptions for an extended period of time, we cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our credit facilities. We also cannot assure you that our lenders would provide relief or that we could secure alternative financing on favorable terms, if at all. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our credit facilities, including financial covenants, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We have based our projections on the amount of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use all our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Our future funding requirements, including long-term funding requirements, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 

the cost of growing our ongoing commercialization and sales and marketing activities; 

the costs of manufacturing and maintaining enough inventories of our systems to meet anticipated demand and inventory write-offs related to obsolete products or components; 

the costs of enhancing the existing functionality and development of new functionalities for our systems; 

the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation; 

any product liability or other lawsuits and the costs associated with defending them or the results of such lawsuits; 

the costs associated with conducting business and maintaining subsidiaries and other entities in foreign jurisdictions; 

customers in jurisdictions where our systems are not approved delaying their purchase, and not purchasing our systems, until they are approved or cleared for use in their market; 

the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and 

the costs associated with being a public company. 

In order to grow our business and increase revenues, we will need to introduce and commercialize new products, grow our sales and marketing force, implement new software systems, as well as identify and penetrate new markets. Such endeavors have in the past increased, and may continue in the future, to increase our expenses, including sales and marketing, and research and development. We will have to continue to increase our revenues while effectively managing our expenses in order to achieve profitability and to sustain it. Our failure to control expenses could make it difficult to achieve profitability or to sustain profitability in the future. Moreover, we cannot be sure that our expenditures will result in the successful development and introduction of new products in a cost-effective and timely manner or that any such new products will achieve market acceptance and generate revenues for our business.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not currently engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which includes special purpose entities and other structured finance entities. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, long-term receivables, allowance for expected credit losses, warranty accrual, and stock-based compensation have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, and therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 We generate revenue from (1) sales of systems through our internal lease programs, in accordance with ASC 842, "Leases" ("ASC 842"), traditional system sales to customers and distributors, (2) other product revenues from the sale of ARTAS procedure kits, marketing supplies and kits, consumables and (3) our extended warranty service contracts provided to existing customers. 
 
 We recognize revenues on other products and services in accordance with ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASC 606"). Revenue is recognized based on the following five steps: (1) identification of the contract(s) with the customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 
 
 We record our revenue net of sales tax and shipping and handling costs. 
 
 Long-term receivables 
 
 Long-term receivables relate to our internal lease programs revenue or contracts which stipulate payment terms which exceed one year. They are comprised of the unpaid principal balance, net of the allowance for expected credit losses. These receivables have been discounted based on the implicit interest rate in the subscription lease which range between 8 and 10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 8 and 10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Unearned interest revenue represents the interest only portion of the respective lease program payments and will be recognized in income over the respective payment term as it is earned. 
 
 Allowance for expected credit losses 
 
 The allowance for expected credit losses is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of the related invoices and represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable. We regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the account receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay. 
 
 Warranty accrual 
 
 We generally offer a one year warranty for all our systems against defects. The warranty period begins upon shipment and we record a liability for accrued warranty costs at the time of sale of a system, which consists of the remaining warranty on systems sold based on historical warranty costs and management s estimates. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts thereof as necessary. We exercise judgment in estimating expected system warranty costs. If actual system failure rates, freight, material, technical support and labor costs differ from our estimates, we will be required to revise our estimated warranty liability. To date, our warranty reserve has been sufficient to satisfy warranty claims paid. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 We account for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all stock based payments to employees be recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. 
 
 The fair value of stock options on the grant date is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the single-option approach. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock, to determine the fair value of the award. We recognize the expense associated with options using a single-award approach over the requisite service period. 
 
 Financial statements in U.S. dollars 
 
 We believe that the U.S. dollar is the currency in the primary economic environment in which we operate. The U.S. dollar is the most significant currency in which our revenues are generated, and our costs are incurred. In addition, our debt and equity financings are generally based in U.S. dollars. Therefore, our functional currency, and that of our subsidiaries, is the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Transactions and balances originally denominated in U.S. dollars are presented at their original amounts. Non-dollar transactions and balances are re-measured into U.S. dollars in accordance with the principles set forth in ASC 830-10 Foreign Currency Translation." All exchange gains and losses from re-measurement of monetary balance sheet items resulting from transactions in non-U.S. dollar currencies are recorded as foreign exchange loss in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations as they arise. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure for this Item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of these limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with established policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm because the Company is not an "accelerated filer" or a "large accelerated filer."

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not a party to any material active or pending legal proceedings. 
 
 We may from time to time continue to be involved in various legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the ordinary course of our business. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risk and uncertainties, including those described below and the risk factors described under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our latest Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the related notes thereto, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included herein, and the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference herein . 
 
 Conditions in the Middle East, including the October 2023 attack by Hamas and other terrorist organizations on Israel and Israel s war against them, may adversely affect our operations and limit our ability to manage and market our products, which could lead to a decrease in revenues. 
 
 Certain of our operations are conducted in Israel and a number of our employees, contract manufacturers and consultants, including employees of our service providers, are located in Israel. As such, our business and operations may be directly affected by economic, political, geopolitical and military conditions affecting Israel. 
 
 On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. Thereafter, these terrorists launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip. Shortly following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas. The intensity, duration and impact of Israel s current war against Hamas and the corresponding geopolitical instability in the region is difficult to predict, as are the war s economic implications on the Company s business and operations. 
 
 Additionally, political uprisings, social unrest and violence in various other countries in the Middle East, including Israel s neighboring countries Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan, are affecting the political stability of those countries. This instability may lead to deterioration of the political relationships that exist between Israel and certain countries and have raised concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence over various proxy militias across the Middle East, and among the Syrian government, Hamas and Hezbollah, in addition to its readiness to engage in conflict with Israel directly. These situations may potentially escalate in the future into more violent events which may affect Israel and us. These situations, including conflicts which involved missile strikes against civilian and military targets in various parts of Israel may negatively impact the Company s operations in Israel. 
 
 In recent months, we have seen the level of conflict in the region escalate. Our facilities are within the range of rockets that have been launched from surrounding territories, though none of our operations or those of our manufacturers have been impacted to date. In the event that our facilities in Israel, or the facilities of our vendors in Israel, are damaged as a result of the hostilities or hostilities otherwise disrupt the ongoing operation of our facilities, our ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner to meet our contractual obligations with customers and vendors could be materially and adversely affected. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Our insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of an event associated with the security situation in the Middle East or for any resulting disruption in our operations. Although the Israeli government has in the past covered the reinstatement value of direct damages that were caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot be assured that this government coverage will be maintained or, if maintained, will be sufficient to compensate us fully for damages incurred and the government may cease providing such coverage or the coverage might not suffice to cover potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Our operations may be disrupted because of the obligation of Israeli citizens to perform military service. 
 
 As a result of the Israeli security cabinet s decision to declare war against Hamas, Israeli reservists have been drafted to perform immediate military service. Certain of our employees and consultants in Israel, in addition to employees of our service providers located in Israel, have been called for service in the current war with Hamas as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and such persons may be absent for an extended period of time. As a result, our operations may be disrupted by such absences, which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the absence of employees of our Israeli suppliers and contract manufacturers due to their military service in the current war or future wars or other armed conflicts may disrupt their operations, in which event our ability to deliver products to customers may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 We offer credit terms to some qualified customers and distributors. In the event that a customer or distributor defaults on the amounts payable to us, our financial results may be adversely affected. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 28 of our total system revenues were derived from our internal lease programs (Venus Prime and our legacy subscription-based model). Under our internal lease programs, we collect an up-front fee, combined with a monthly payment schedule typically over a period of 36 months, with approximately 40 to 45 of total contract payments collected in the first year. For accounting purposes, these arrangements are considered to be sales-type finance leases, where the present value of all cash flows to be received under the Venus Prime or subscription agreement is recognized as revenue upon shipment of the system to the customer. We cannot provide any assurance that the financial position of customers purchasing products and services under a Venus Prime or subscription agreement will not change adversely before we receive all the monthly installment payments due under the contract. In the event that there is a default by any of the customers to whom we have sold systems under our internal lease programs (Venus Prime or our legacy subscription-based model), we may recognize bad debt expenses in our general and administrative expenses. If the extent of such defaults is material, it could negatively affect our results of operations and operating cash flows. 
 
 In addition to our internal lease programs, we generally offer credit terms of 30 to 90 days to qualified customers and distributors. In the event that there is a default by any of the customers or distributors to whom we have provided credit terms, we may recognize bad debt expenses in our general and administrative expenses. If the extent of such defaults is material, it could negatively affect our future results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We may also be adversely affected by bankruptcies or other business failures of our customers, distributors, and potential customers. A significant delay in the collection of accounts receivable or a reduction of accounts receivables collected may impact our liquidity or result in bad debt expenses. 
 
 We may not be able to maintain our listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and it may become more difficult to sell our stock in the public market . 
 
 Minimum Stockholder Equity Requirement 
 
 On May 31, 2023, we received a notice (the Notice from Nasdaq stating that our stockholders equity as reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023 was below the minimum 2,500,000 required for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) Minimum Equity Requirement ). 
 
 The Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock. On July 17, 2023, we submitted to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Equity Requirement (the "Plan"). On July 28, 2023, Nasdaq granted us an extension until November 27, 2023 to evidence compliance with the Minimum Equity Requirement, conditioned upon our achievement of certain milestones as set forth in the Plan. On November 28, 2023, the Company received a written notice from the Nasdaq Staff which described its determination that the Company had not regained compliance with the Minimum Equity Requirement within the Plan period. As a result, the Nasdaq Staff advised the Company that its securities will be delisted at the opening of business on December 7, 2023, unless the Company timely requests a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the "Panel ). 
 
 On December 5, 2023, the Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel. The hearing was held on March 5, 2024, staying any delisting pending the issuance of the Panel s decision. 
 
 On March 20, 2024, the Company received a decision from the Panel granting its request for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to the Company demonstrating compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) on or before May 28, 2024, and certain other conditions. 
 
 On June 4, 2024, the Company was formally notified by Nasdaq that the Company had regained compliance with the stockholders equity Minimum Equity Requirement. 
 
 The Company is subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor, as defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), through June 4, 2025. If the Company is found to be noncompliant with the Minimum Equity Requirement within the monitoring period, the Company would not be allowed to provide the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff with a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Equity Requirement; rather, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff would be required to issue a delist determination. In such case, the Company would have the opportunity to request a new hearing before the Panel, which request would stay any further action by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff until the time of the hearing. 
 
 Minimum Bid Price Requirement 
 
 On April 11, 2024, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that for 32 consecutive business days the Company s common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share as required for continued listing under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 
 
 In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has 180 calendar days, or until the Initial Compliance Date, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The Company did not regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by the Initial Compliance Date. 
 
 On October 17, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it is eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period, or until the Extended Compliance Date, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. If, at any time before the Extended Compliance Date, the bid price for the Company s common stock closes at 1.00 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days as required under the Compliance Period Rule, the Staff will provide written notification to the Company that it complies with the Bid Price Requirement, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this 10 day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H). 
 
 If the Company does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by the Extended Compliance Date, the Staff will provide written notification to the Company that its common stock will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal the Staff s delisting determination to the Panel. The Company expects that its common stock would remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market pending the Panel s decision. There can be no assurance that, if the Company does appeal a delisting determination to the Panel, such appeal would be successful 
 
 If our common stock ultimately is delisted for failure to comply with either the Minimum Equity Requirement or Minimum Bid Price Requirement, our shareholders could face significant adverse consequences, including: 

Limited availability or market quotations for our common stock; 

Reduced liquidity of our common stock; 

Determination that shares of our common stock are penny stock, which would require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; 

Limited amount of news analysts coverage of us; and 

Decreased ability for us to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future.
