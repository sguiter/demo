FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP INFORMATION 
 Table of Contents 

Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report, including materials incorporated into it, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to FHN's beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are not a representation of historical information, but instead pertain to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely, will, going forward, and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements. 
 Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change and could cause our actual future results and outcomes to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements or historical performance. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: 
 global, general and local economic and business conditions, including economic recession or depression; 
 the stability or volatility of values and activity in the residential housing and commercial real estate markets; 
 expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope and shape of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; 
 market and monetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage markets; 
 the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; 
 competition within and outside the financial services industry; 
 the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, global pandemics, conflicts, or terrorist attacks, or other adverse external events; 
 effectiveness and cost-efficiency of FHN s hedging practices; 
 fraud, theft, or other incursions through conventional, electronic, or other means directly or 

indirectly affecting FHN or its clients, business counterparties, or competitors; 
 the ability to adapt products and services to changing industry standards and client preferences; 
 risks inherent in originating, selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets, including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in client profiles; 
 changes in the regulation of the U.S. financial services industry; 
 changes in laws, regulations, and administrative actions, including executive orders, whether or not specific to the financial services industry; 
 potential claims alleging mortgage servicing failures, individually, on a class basis, or as master servicer of securitized loans; 
 potential claims relating to participation in government programs, especially lending or other financial services programs; 
 potential requirements for FHN to repurchase, or compensate for losses from, previously sold or securitized mortgages or securities based on such mortgages; 
 changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations; 
 evolving capital and liquidity standards under applicable regulatory rules; 
 accounting policies and processes that require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; 
 reputational risk and potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships; and 
 other factors that may affect future results of FHN. 
 FHN assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements that are made in this report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change, possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including those factors listed above or presented elsewhere in this report, those factors listed in material incorporated by reference into this report, and other factors not listed. In evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects, readers of this report should carefully consider the factors mentioned above along with the additional risk factors discussed in Item 2 of Part I and Item 1A of Part II of this report, and in the forepart, and in Items 1, 1A, and 7, of FHN s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, among others.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP INFORMATION 
 Table of Contents 

Non-GAAP Information 
 Certain measures included in this report are non-GAAP, meaning they are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and also are not codified in U.S. banking regulations currently applicable to FHN. Although other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by FHN for non-GAAP measures, FHN s management believes such measures are relevant to understanding the financial condition, capital position, and financial results of FHN and its business segments. Non-GAAP measures are reported to FHN s management and Board of Directors through various internal reports. 
 
 The non-GAAP measures presented in this report are: pre-provision net revenue, return on average tangible common equity, tangible common equity to tangible assets, adjusted tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and tangible book value per common share. Table I.2.26 appe aring in the MD A (Item 2 of Part I) of this report provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP items presented in this report to the most comparable GAAP presentation. 

Presentation of regulatory measures, even those which are not GAAP, provide a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions subject to the same regulations as FHN, as demonstrated by their use by banking regulators in reviewing capital adequacy of financial institutions. Although not GAAP terms, these regulatory measures are not considered non-GAAP under U.S. financial reporting rules as long as their presentation conforms to regulatory standards. Regulatory measures used in this report include : common equity tier 1 capital, generally defined as common equity less goodwill, other intangibles, and certain other required regulatory deductions; tier 1 capital, generally defined as the sum of core capital (including common equity and instruments that cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder) adjusted for certain items under risk based capital regulations; and risk-weighted assets, which is a measure of total on- and off-balance sheet assets adjusted for credit and market risk, used to determine regulatory capital ratios.

 million, net of tax, on January 1, 2024. 
 The adoption of ASU 2023-02 resulted in a revision to FHN s accounting policy for equity investments in tax credit programs. FHN s election to utilize the deferral method for investments that generate Investment Tax Credits is now made subsequent to the determination of whether a tax credit program will apply the proportional amortization method. This includes both solar and non-qualifying historic tax credit investments. Under the deferral approach the investment tax credits are recorded as an offset to the related investment on the balance sheet. Credit amounts are recognized in earnings over the life of the investment within the same income or expense accounts as used for the investment. 
 Accounting Changes Issued But Not Currently Effective 
 ASU 2023-07 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" that requires public entities to provide disclosures of significant segment expenses, including interest expense, and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The ASU requires a public entity to disclose, for each reportable segment, the significant expense categories and amounts that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM) and included in each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 also requires disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. 
 ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is impracticable. FHN will adopt ASU 2023-07 as of December 31, 2024 and is currently assessing the effect on its reportable segment disclosures. 
 ASU 2023-09 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" to enhance transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The provisions of this ASU require disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation in both percentages and reporting currency amounts. Certain categories of reconciling items are required by the ASU with additional categories required if a specified quantitative threshold is met. Reporting entities are also required to provide a

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Consistent with FHN's review of the related securities, there were no credit-related write-downs of AIR for AFS debt securities during the reporting periods. Additionally, for AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, FHN does not intend to sell them, and it is more likely than not that FHN will not be required to sell them prior to recovery. Therefore, no write-downs of these investments to fair value occurred during the reporting periods. There were transfers to or from AFS or HTM during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 For HTM securities, an allowance for credit losses is required to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses. Total AIR not included in the fair value or amortized cost basis of HTM debt securities was million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. FHN has assessed the risk of credit loss and has determined that allowance for credit losses for HTM securities was necessary as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The evaluation of credit risk includes consideration of third-party and government guarantees (both explicit and implicit), senior or subordinated status, credit ratings of the issuer, the effects of interest rate changes since purchase and observable market information such as issuer-specific credit spreads.

 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Most of FHN s business activity is with clients located in the southern United States. FHN s lending activity is concentrated in its market areas within those states. As of September 30, 2024, FHN had loans to mortgage companies of billion and loans to finance and insurance companies of billion. As a result, of the C I portfolio is sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry. 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 FHN employs a dual grade commercial risk grading methodology to assign an estimate for the probability of 

default and the loss given default for each commercial loan using factors specific to various industry, portfolio, or product segments that result in a rank ordering of risk and the assignment of grades PD to PD . This credit grading system is intended to identify and measure the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio by analyzing the migration between grading categories. It is also integral to the estimation methodology utilized in determining the ALLL since an allowance is established for pools of commercial loans based on the credit grade assigned. Each PD grade corresponds to an estimated one-year default probability percentage. PD grades are continually evaluated but require a formal scorecard annually. 
 PD 1 through PD 12 are pass grades. PD grades 13-16 correspond to the regulatory-defined categories of special mention (13), substandard (14), doubtful (15), and loss (16). Special mention loans and leases have potential

 The consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of smaller-balance loans which are very similar in nature in that most are standard products and are backed by residential real estate. Because of the similarities of consumer loan types, FHN is able to utilize the FICO score, among other attributes, to assess the credit quality of consumer borrowers. FICO scores are refreshed on a quarterly basis in an attempt to reflect the recent risk profile of the borrowers. Accruing delinquency amounts are indicators of asset quality within the credit card and other consumer portfolio.

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans and Leases 
 Loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or on a case-by-case basis if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccrual are loans 

for which FHN continues to receive payments including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy. 
 Past due loans are loans contractually past due as to interest or principal payments, but which have not yet been put on nonaccrual status.

 Collateral-Dependent Loans 
 Collateral-dependent loans are defined as loans for which repayment is expected to be derived substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. At a minimum, the estimated value of the collateral for each loan equals the current book value. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FHN had commercial loans with amortized cost of approximately million and million, respectively, that were based on the value of underlying collateral. Collateral-dependent C I and CRE loans totaled million and million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. The collateral for these loans generally consists of business assets including land, buildings, equipment, and financial assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, FHN recognized charge-offs of million and million, respectively, on these loans related to reductions in estimated collateral values. 
 Consumer HELOC and real estate installment loa ns with amortized cost based on the va lue of underlying real estate collateral were approximately million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. Charge-offs relating to collateral-dependent consumer loans were million for the nine 

months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Loan Modifications to Troubled Borrowers 
 As part of FHN s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when necessary to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Modifications could include extension of the maturity date, reductions of the interest rate, reduction or forgiveness of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. Combinations of these modifications may also be made for individual loans. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Principal reductions may be made in limited circumstances, typically for specific commercial loan workouts, and in the event of borrower bankruptcy. Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. 
 Troubled loans are considered those in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty can be subjective in nature and management s judgment may be required in making this determination. FHN may determine that a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt, or if it is probable that a borrower may default in the foreseeable future absent a modification. Many aspects of a borrower s financial

 NOTE 4 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

 Note 4 
 . After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company immediately reverts to its historical loss averages, evaluated over the historical observation period, for the remaining estimated life of the loans. In order to capture the unique risks of the loan portfolio within the PD, LGD, and prepayment models, FHN segments the portfolio into pools, generally incorporating loan grades for commercial loans. As there can be no certainty that actual economic performance will precisely follow any specific macroeconomic forecast, FHN uses qualitative adjustments where current loan characteristics or current or forecasted economic conditions differ from historical periods. 
 The evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information is performed through assessments of groups of assets that share similar risk characteristics and certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collective group. As described in Note 3 - Loans and Leases, loans are grouped generally by product type and significant loan portfolios are assessed for credit losses using analytical or statistical models. The quantitative component utilizes economic forecast information as its foundation and is primarily based on analytical models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period. The ACL is also 

affected by qualitative factors that FHN considers to reflect current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in the quantitative calculations, including alternative economic forecasts. 
 In accordance with its accounting policy elections, FHN does not recognize a separate allowance for expected credit losses for AIR and records reversals of AIR as reductions of interest income. FHN reverses previously accrued but uncollected interest when an asset is placed on nonaccrual status. AIR and the related allowance for expected credit losses is included as a component of other assets. The total amount of interest reversals from loans placed on nonaccrual status and the amount of income recognized on nonaccrual loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material. 
 Expected credit losses for unfunded commitments are estimated for periods where the commitment is not unconditionally cancellable. The measurement of expected credit losses for unfunded commitments mirrors that of loans and leases with the additional estimate of future draw rates (timing and amount). 
 The increase in the ACL balance as of September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, largely reflects downgrades and an evolving macroeconomic outlook. In developing credit loss estimates for its loan and lease portfolios, FHN utilized two Moody s forecast scenarios for its macroeconomic inputs. As of September 30, 2024, among other things, FHN's scenario selection process factored in the outlook for production, inflation, interest rates, employment, real estate prices and international conflict. FHN selected one scenario as its base case, which was the Moody's baseline scenario. The heaviest weight was placed on this scenario. A smaller weight was placed on the FHN-selected downside scenario which was the Moody's S3 alternative scenario. FHN's scenario selection process was consistent with the prior quarter. 
 Management also made qualitative adjustments to reflect estimated recoveries based on a review of prior charge-off and recovery levels, for default risk associated with large balances with individual borrowers, for estimated loss amounts not reflected in historical factors due to specific portfolio risk or identified model limitations, and for instances where limited data for acquired loans is considered to affect modeled results.

 FHN s repurchase and foreclosure liability, primarily related to its pre-2009 mortgage origination, sale, securitization, and servicing businesses, is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline, estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The active pipeline consists of mortgage loan repurchase and make-whole demands from loan purchasers or securitization participants, foreclosure/servicing demands from borrowers, and

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accrued liabilities for FHN s estimate of these obligations are reflected in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Charges/expense reversals to increase/decrease the liability are included within other income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The estimates are based upon currently available information and fact patterns that exist as of each balance sheet date and could be subject to 

future changes. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of FHN s liability. 
 Other Disclosures 
 Indemnification Agreements and Guarantees 
 In the ordinary course of business, FHN enters into indemnification agreements for legal proceedings against its directors and officers and standard representations and warranties for underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, contractual commitments, and various other business transactions or arrangements. 
 The extent of FHN s obligations under these agreements depends upon the occurrence of future events; therefore, it is not possible to estimate a maximum potential amount of payouts that could be required by such agreements.

 . Benefits under the plan are frozen so that years of service and compensation changes after 2012 do not affect the benefit owed. Minimum contributions are based upon actuarially determined amounts necessary to fund the total benefit obligation. Decisions to contribute to the plan are based upon pension funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act, the maximum amount deductible under the Internal Revenue Code, the actual performance of plan assets, and trends in the regulatory environment. FHN made no contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2023. Management does not currently anticipate that FHN will make a contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2024. 
 FHN also maintains non-qualified plans including a supplemental retirement plan that covers certain 

employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan have been limited by tax rules. These other non-qualified plans are unfunded, and contributions to these plans cover all benefits paid under the non-qualified plans. Payments made under the non-qualified plans were million for 2023. FHN anticipates making benefit payments under the non-qualified plans of million in 2024. 
 Service cost is included in personnel expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are included in other expense.

 Nonconsolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 Tax Credit Investments 
 Through designated wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Horizon Bank makes equity investments as a limited partner in various partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the LIHTC. Through designated subsidiaries, First Horizon Bank periodically makes equity investments as a non-managing member in various LLCs that sponsor community development projects utilizing the NMTC. First Horizon Bank also makes equity investments as a limited partner or non-managing member in entities that receive historic tax credits. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to support FHN s community reinvestment initiatives. These entities are considered VIEs as First Horizon Bank's subsidiaries represent the holders of the equity investment at risk, but do not have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the performance of the entities. FHN is therefore not the primary beneficiary of any of these entities. 

Accordingly, FHN does not consolidate these VIEs and accounts for these investments in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 FHN accounts for qualifying LIHTC investments under the proportional amortization method (PAM). Effective for periods after 2023, all LIHTC investments qualify for the PAM. Commencing in 2024, FHN has determined that its equity investments in NMTC and historic tax credit entities qualify for the PAM and has made the election to apply the PAM for these programs. Under this method an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance as a component of income tax expense. Prior to 2024, LIHTC investments that did not qualify for the PAM were accounted for using the equity method. Expenses associated with non-qualifying LIHTC investments were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Small Issuer Trust Preferred Holdings 
 First Horizon Bank holds variable interests in trusts which have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities trust preferreds for smaller banking and insurance enterprises. First Horizon Bank has no voting rights for the trusts activities. The trusts only assets are junior subordinated debentures of the issuing enterprises. The creditors of the trusts hold no recourse to the assets of First Horizon Bank. Since First Horizon Bank is solely a holder of the trusts securities, it has no rights which would give it the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts economic performance and thus it is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts. First Horizon Bank has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trusts. 
 On-Balance Sheet Trust Preferred Securitization 
 In 2007, First Horizon Bank executed a securitization of certain small issuer trust preferreds for which the underlying trust meets the definition of a VIE as the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance. Since First Horizon Bank did not retain servicing or other decision-making rights, First Horizon Bank is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trust s economic performance. Accordingly, First Horizon Bank has accounted for the funds received through the securitization as a term borrowing in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. First Horizon Bank has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trust. 
 Holdings in Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities 
 FHN holds securities issued by various Agency securitization trusts. Based on their restrictive nature, the trusts meet the definition of a VIE since the holders of the equity investments at risk do not have the power through voting rights, or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities economic performance. FHN could potentially receive benefits or 

absorb losses that are significant to the trusts based on the nature of the trusts activities and the size of FHN s holdings. However, FHN is solely a holder of the trusts securities and does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts economic performance and is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts. FHN has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the trusts. 
 Commercial Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 For certain troubled commercial loans, First Horizon Bank modifies the terms of the borrower s debt in an effort to increase the probability of receipt of amounts contractually due. Following a modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, the borrower entity typically meets the definition of a VIE as the initial determination of whether an entity is a VIE must be reconsidered as events have proven that the entity s equity is not sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or a restructuring of the terms of its financing. As First Horizon Bank does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such troubled commercial borrowers operations, it is not considered the primary beneficiary even in situations where, based on the size of the financing provided, First Horizon Bank is exposed to potentially significant benefits and losses of the borrowing entity. First Horizon Bank has no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the borrowing entities beyond certain funding commitments established upon restructuring of the terms of the debt that allows for preparation of the underlying collateral for sale. 
 Proprietary Trust Preferred Issuances 
 In conjunction with its acquisitions, FHN acquired junior subordinated debt underlying multiple issuances of trust preferred debt. All of the trusts are considered VIEs because the ownership interests from the capital contributions to these trusts are not considered at risk in evaluating whether the holders of the equity investments at risk in the trusts have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities

 million and million of cash receivables and million and million of cash payables related to collateral posting under master netting arrangements, inclusive of collateral posted related to contracts with adjustable collateral posting thresholds and over-collateralized positions, with derivative counterparties. With exchange-traded contracts, the credit risk is limited to the clearinghouse used. For non-exchange traded instruments, credit risk may occur when there is a gain in the fair value of the financial instrument and the counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of the contract and/or when the collateral proves to be of insufficient value. See additional discussion regarding master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements later in this note under the heading Master Netting and Similar Agreements. 
 Market risk represents the potential loss due to the decrease in the value of a financial instrument caused primarily by changes in interest rates or the prices of debt instruments. FHN manages market risk by establishing and 

monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken. FHN continually measures this risk through the use of models that measure value-at-risk and earnings-at-risk. 
 Derivative Instruments 
 FHN enters into various derivative contracts both to facilitate client transactions and as a risk management tool. Where contracts have been created for clients, FHN enters into upstream transactions with dealers to offset its risk exposure. Contracts with dealers that require central clearing are novated to a clearing agent who becomes FHN s counterparty. Derivatives are also used as a risk management tool to hedge FHN s exposure to changes in interest rates or other defined market risks. 
 Forward contracts are over-the-counter contracts where two parties agree to purchase and sell a specific quantity of a financial instrument at a specified price, with delivery or settlement at a specified date. Futures contracts are exchange-traded contracts where two parties agree to purchase and sell a specific quantity of a financial instrument at a specified price, with delivery or settlement at a specified date. Interest rate option contracts give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified quantity of a financial instrument, at a specified price, during a specified period of time. Caps and floors are options that are linked to a notional principal amount and an underlying indexed interest rate. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest payments at specified intervals between two parties without the exchange of any underlying principal. Swaptions are options on interest rate swaps that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap agreement during a specified period of time. 
 Trading Activities 
 FHNF trades U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, government-guaranteed loan, mortgage-backed, corporate and municipal fixed income securities, and other securities for distribution to clients. When these securities settle on a delayed basis, they are considered forward contracts. FHNF also enters into interest rate contracts, including caps, swaps, and floors, for its clients. In addition, FHNF enters into futures and option contracts to economically hedge interest rate risk associated with a portion of its securities inventory. These transactions are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in noninterest income. Related assets and liabilities are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as derivative assets and derivative liabilities within other assets and other liabilities. The FHNF Risk Committee and the Credit Risk Management Committee collaborate to mitigate credit risk related to these transactions. Credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, risk control limits, and ongoing monitoring procedures. Total trading

 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 FHN s ALCO focuses on managing market risk by controlling and limiting earnings volatility attributable to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk exists to the extent that interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have different maturity or repricing characteristics. FHN uses derivatives, primarily swaps, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change. Interest paid or received for swaps utilized by FHN to hedge the fair value of long-term debt is recognized as an adjustment of the interest expense of the liabilities whose risk is being managed. FHN s interest rate risk management policy is to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk or market value of assets or liabilities, 

not to speculate. In addition, FHN has entered into certain interest rate swaps and caps as a part of a product offering to commercial clients that includes customer derivatives paired with upstream offsetting market instruments that, when completed, are designed to mitigate interest rate risk. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are measured at fair value with gains or losses included in current earnings in noninterest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash Flow Hedges 
 Prior to 2021, FHN entered into pay floating, receive fixed interest rate swaps designed to manage its exposure to the variability in cash flows related to interest payments on debt instruments. The debt instruments primarily consist of held-to-maturity commercial loans that have variable interest payments that historically were based on 1-month LIBOR. In second quarter 2023, the remaining hedge was revised to reference 1-month Term SOFR after the cessation of LIBOR-based cash flows. This hedge matured in first quarter 2024. In conjunction with the IBKC merger, FHN acquired interest rate contracts (floors and collars) which were re-designated as cash flow hedges. The debt instruments associated with these hedges also primarily consisted of held-to-maturity commercial loans that had variable interest payments that were based on 1-month LIBOR. The last hedge acquired in conjunction with the IBKC merger matured in second quarter 2023. 

In 2022, FHN entered into interest rate contracts (floors and swaps) which have been designated as cash flow hedges. These hedges reference 1-month Term SOFR and FHN made certain elections under ASU 2020-04 to facilitate qualification for hedge accounting during the time that hedged items transitioned away from 1-month LIBOR. 
 In a cash flow hedge, the entire change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is initially recorded in OCI and is subsequently reclassified from OCI to current period earnings (interest income or interest expense) in the same period that the hedged item affects earnings.

 In conjunction with pre-2020 sales of Visa Class B shares, FHN entered into derivative transactions whereby FHN will make or receive cash payments whenever the conversion ratio of the Visa Class B shares into Visa Class A shares is adjusted. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the derivative liabilities associated with the sales of Visa Class B shares were million and million, respectively. FHN recognized million in derivative valuation adjustments related to prior sales of Visa Class B shares for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 16 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for discussion of the valuation inputs and processes for these Visa-related derivatives. 
 FHN utilizes cross-currency swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with non-U.S. dollar denominated loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these loans were valued at million and million, respectively. The balance sheet amount and the gains/losses associated with these derivatives were not significant. 
 Related to its loan participation/syndication activities, FHN enters into risk participation agreements, under which it assumes exposure for, or receives indemnification for, borrowers performance on underlying interest rate derivative contracts. FHN's counterparties in these contracts are other lending institutions involved in the loan participation/syndication arrangements for which the underlying interest rate derivative contract is intended to hedge interest rate risk for the borrower. FHN will make (other institution is the lead bank) or receive (FHN is the lead bank) payments for risk participations if the borrower defaults on its obligation to perform under the terms of its interest rate derivative agreement with the lead bank in the participation. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notional values of FHN s risk participations were million and million of derivative assets and million and million of derivative liabilities, respectively. The notional value for risk participation/syndication agreements is consistent with the percentage 

of participation in the lending arrangement. FHN's maximum exposure or benefit in the risk participation agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying interest rate derivative contracts for which the borrower is in a liability position at the time of default. FHN monitors the credit risk associated with the borrowers to which the risk participations relate through the same credit risk assessment process utilized for establishing credit loss estimates for its loan portfolio. These credit risk estimates are included in the determination of fair value for the risk participations. Assuming all underlying third-party customers referenced in the swap contracts defaulted at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the exposure from these agreements would not be material based on the fair value of the underlying swaps. 
 FHN holds certain certificates of deposit with the rate of return based on an equity index which is considered an embedded derivative as a written option that must be separately recognized. The risks of the written option are offset by purchasing an option with terms that mirror the written option, which is also carried at fair value on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FHN had recognized an insignificant amount of assets and liabilities associated with these contracts. 
 Master Netting and Similar Agreements 
 FHN uses master netting agreements, mutual margining agreements and collateral posting requirements to minimize credit risk on derivative contracts. Master netting and similar agreements are used when counterparties have multiple derivatives contracts that allow for a right of setoff, meaning that a counterparty may net offsetting positions and collateral with the same counterparty under the contract to determine a net receivable or payable. The following discussion provides an overview of these arrangements which may vary due to the derivative type and market in which a derivative transaction is executed. 
 Interest rate derivatives are subject to agreements consistent with standard agreement forms of the ISDA.

 million of assets and million of liabilities on September 30, 2024, and million of assets and million of liabilities on December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FHN had received collateral of million and million and posted collateral of million and million, respectively, in the normal course of business related to these agreements. 
 Certain agreements also contain accelerated termination provisions, inclusive of the right of offset, if a counterparty s credit rating falls below a specified level. If a counterparty s debt rating (including FHN s and First Horizon Bank s) were to fall below these minimums, these provisions would be triggered, and the counterparties could terminate the agreements and require immediate settlement of all derivative contracts under the agreements. The net fair value, determined by individual counterparty, of all interest rate derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent accelerated termination provisions was million of assets and million of liabilities on September 30, 2024, and million of assets and million of liabilities on December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FHN had received collateral of million and million and posted collateral of million and million, respectively, in the normal course of business related to these contracts. 
 FHNF buys and sells various types of securities for its clients. When these securities settle on a delayed basis, they are considered forward contracts, and are generally not subject to master netting agreements. For futures and options, FHN transacts through a third party, and the transactions are subject to margin and collateral maintenance requirements. In the event of default, open positions can be offset along with the associated collateral. 
 For this disclosure, FHN considers the impact of master netting and other similar agreements which allow FHN to settle all contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative asset or liability position with the related securities and cash collateral. The application of the collateral cannot reduce the net derivative asset or liability position below zero, and therefore any excess collateral is not reflected in the following tables.

 Loans held for sale 
 Foreclosure losses and prepayment rates are significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement 

of FHN s residential real estate loans held for sale. Loss severity trends are also assessed to evaluate the reasonableness of fair value estimates resulting from discounted cash flows methodologies as well as to estimate fair value for newly repurchased loans and loans that are near foreclosure. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurements. All observable and unobservable inputs are re-assessed quarterly. 
 Increases (decreases) in estimated prepayment rates and bond equivalent yields negatively (positively) affect the value of unguaranteed interests in SBA loans.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount for residential real estate loans held for sale included an insignificant amount of gains in pre-tax earnings that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk. The portion of the fair value adjustments related to credit risk was determined based on estimated default rates and estimated loss severities. Interest income on residential real estate loans held for sale measured at fair value is calculated based on the note rate of the loan and is recorded in the interest income section of the Consolidated Statements of Income as interest on loans held for sale.

Introduction 
 First Horizon Corporation (NYSE common stock trading symbol FHN is a financial holding company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. FHN s principal subsidiary, and only banking subsidiary, is First Horizon Bank. Through the Bank and other subsidiaries, FHN offers commercial, private banking, consumer, small business, wealth and trust management, retail brokerage, capital markets, fixed income, and mortgage banking services. 
 At September 30, 2024, FHN had over 450 business locations in 24 states, including over 400 banking centers 

in 12 states, and employed approximately 7,200 associates. 
 This MD A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, as well as other information contained in this document and FHN's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Executive Overview 
 
 Financial Performance Summary 
 Third Quarter 2024 Highlights 
 FHN reported third quarter 2024 net income available to common shareholders of 213 million, or 0.40 per diluted share, compared to 184 million , or 0.34 per diluted share, in second quarter 2024 and 129 million, or 0.23 per diluted share, in third quarter 2023. 
 Net interest income of 627 million decreased 2 million compared to second quarter 2024 from increased deposit costs and higher levels of brokered deposits, partially offset by improvement in loan repricing. Net interest income increased 22 million compared to third quarter 2023, driven by the impact of higher yields on earning assets partially offset by higher funding costs. 
 Provision for credit losses was 35 million for third quarter 2024 compared to 55 million for second quarter 2024 and 110 million for third quarter 2023. Net charge-offs were 24 million, or 15 basis points, compared to 34 million, or 22 basis points, in second quarter 2024 and 95 million, or 61 basis points, in third quarter 2023. Third quarter 2023 included a single 72 million charge-off for a company in bankruptcy. 
 Noninterest income of 200 million increased 14 million compared to second quarter 2024, largely driven by an increase in fixed income production. Noninterest income for third quarter 2024 increased 27 million, or 16 , compared to third quarter 2023, also largely driven by higher fixed income production. 
 Noninterest expense of 511 million increased 11 million from second quarter 2024, largely resulting from 15 million in Visa derivative valuation expense. Compared with third quarter 2023, noninterest expense increased 37 million, or 8 , largely reflecting an increase in personnel expense, expenses related to strategic investments and Visa derivative valuation expense. 
 Year-to-Date and Period End Highlights 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income available to common shareholders was 

581 million, or 1.06 per diluted share, compared to 689 million, or 1.23 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest income decreased 42 million, largely driven by higher funding costs partially offset by higher earning asset yields and loan growth. 
 Provision for credit losses of 140 million decreased 70 million for the year-to-date period of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, largely reflecting the impact of a single large credit loss in 2023. 
 Noninterest income for the year-to-date period decreased 164 million, or 22 , primarily from the gain on merger termination in 2023, partially offset by higher fixed income, mortgage banking income and brokerage, management fees and commissions in 2024. 
 Noninterest expense for the year-to-date period increased 19 million, or 1 , largely attributable to higher personnel expense, deposit insurance expense and legal and professional fees partially offset by lower contributions expense. 
 Period-end loans and leases of 62.4 billion increased 1.2 billion, or 2 , from December 31, 2023. Commercial loan growth of 948 million was driven by growth in loans to mortgage companies and CRE loans partially offset by a decline in other C I loans. Consumer loan growth of 205 million was largely driven by growth in consumer real estate loans. 
 Period-end deposits of 66.6 billion increased 795 million, or 1 , compared to December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased 1.8 billion and noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 992 million. 
 The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.23 at September 30, 2024 compared to 11.40 at December 31, 2023. Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2024 were 12.24 and 13.88 , down from 12.42 and 13.96 at December 31, 2023, respectively.

Results of Operations 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is FHN's largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. 
 The following tables present the major components of net interest income and net interest margin:

Third Quarter 2024 versus Second Quarter 2024 
 Net interest income of 627 million in third quarter 2024 decreased 2 million from second quarter 2024 and the net interest margin decreased 7 basis points to 3.31 , driven by increased deposit costs and higher levels of brokered deposits, partially offset by improvement in loan repricing. Loan yield increased 3 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 14 basis points. 
 Average earning assets of 76.1 billion in third quarter 2024 increased 878 million from second quarter 2024, largely due to a 384 million increase in average loans and leases, a 293 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits with banks, a 139 million increase in average investment securities and a 102 million increase in average trading securities, partially offset by a 38 million decrease in average securities purchased under agreements to resell. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 1.1 billion, largely reflecting a 1.5 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 383 million decrease in average other short-term borrowings. 

Third Quarter 2024 versus Third Quarter 2023 
 Net interest income increased 22 million from third quarter 2023 and the net interest margin increased 14 basis points to 3.31 in third quarter 2024, driven by higher yields on earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs. Yields on earning assets increased 24 basis points while funding costs increased 4 basis points. 
 Average earning assets decreased 185 million from third quarter 2023, largely attributable to a 1.1 billion decrease in average interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by a 981 million increase in average loans and leases. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 1.4 billion, largely driven by a 1.8 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits and a 300 million increase in average trading liabilities, partially offset by a 906 million decrease in average other short-term borrowings.

 There were no merger and integration related expenses in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 51 million for the same period of 2023. Restructuring expenses were 10 million for both year-to-date periods of 2024 and 2023. 

Provision for Credit Losses 
 Provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the accrual for unfunded lending commitments at levels appropriate to absorb management s estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments. 
 Provision for credit losses decreased to 35 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to 55 million for the 

second quarter 2024 and 110 million for third quarter 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, provision for credit losses was 140 million, compared to 210 million for the same period of 2023. The provision in 2023 reflected the impact of a 72 million credit loss from a single borrower in bankruptcy. For additional information about general asset quality trends, refer to the Asset Quality section in this MD A. 

Income Taxes 
 FHN recorded income tax expe nse of 58 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 56 million in second q uarter 2024 an d 52 million i n third quarter 2023. For the nine 

months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , FHN recorded income tax expense of 171 million and 223 million , respectively.

 3Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS (MD A) Table of Contents 

The effective tax rate was approximate ly 20.6 , 21.5 , and 26.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectivel y. The effective tax rate was approximately 21.5 and 23.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 FHN s effec tive tax rate is favorably affected by recurring items such as tax credits and other tax benefits from tax credit investments, tax-exempt income, and bank-owned life insurance. The effective rate is unfavorably affected by the non-deductible portions of FDIC premium, executive compensation and merger expenses. FHN s effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, FHN recognized 5 million of net favorable discrete items, primarily attributable to the lapse of the statute of limitations for uncertain tax positions. The higher rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily attributable to net unfavorable discrete items related to the termination of bank owned life insurance (BOLI) policies in the third quarter of 2023 and 

the gain on merger agreement termination in the second quarter of 2023. 
 A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying current enacted statutory tax rates to these temporary differences in future years. As of September 30, 2024, FHN s gross DTA and gross DTL wer e 715 million and 529 million, respectively, resulting in a net DTA of 186 million at September 30, 2024, compared with a net DTA of 215 million at December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, FHN had deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of 29 million and 3 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates. 
 Based on current analysis, FHN believes that its ability to realize the net DTA is more likely than not. FHN monitors its net DTA and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. A significant adverse change in FHN s taxable earnings outlook could result in the need for a valuation allowance. 

Business Segment Results 
 FHN's reportable segments include Regional Banking, Specialty Banking and Corporate. See Note 12 - Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional disclosures related to FHN's segments. 
 Regional Banking 
 The Regional Banking segment generated pre-tax income of 269 million for third quarter 2024, an increase of 28 million compared to second quarter 2024. Net interest income of 517 million decreased 5 million, driven by higher interest-bearing deposit costs, partially offset by improvement in loan repricing. Provision for credit losses of 33 million decreased 24 million from the prior quarter. Noninterest income increased 5 million compared to the prior quarter, largely driven by higher wealth management fees and deposit transaction and cash management fees. Noninterest expense decreased 4 million compared to second quarter 2024. largely due to a decline in other losses. 
 Pre-tax income for third quarter 2024 increased 28 million to 269 million, compared to 241 million for third quarter 2023. Net interest income decreased 41 million from third quarter 2023, driven by a decline in average noninterest-bearing deposits and thus lower earnings credit under the funds transfer pricing methodology, as well as higher interest-bearing deposit costs, partially offset by higher loan balances and yields. The provision for credit losses decreased 80 million compared to third quarter 2023, largely reflecting a credit 

loss on a single relationship in 2023. Noninterest expense increased 19 million compared to third quarter 2023, largely due to higher personnel expense and expenses related to strategic investments. Results also reflect an 8 million increase in noninterest income compared to third quarter 2023, largely driven by improvement in wealth management fees. 
 Pre-tax income of 795 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 105 million compared to the same period of 2023, largely from a 121 million decrease in revenue primarily driven by net interest income. Provision for credit losses decreased 65 million, largely reflecting a credit loss on a single relationship in 2023. Noninterest expense increased 49 million, largely attributable to higher personnel expense and expenses related to strategic investments. 
 Specialty Banking 
 Pre-tax income in the Specialty Banking segment of 126 million for third quarter 2024 increased 8 million compared to second quarter 2024, largely driven by higher fixed income production. Provision for credit losses increased 2 million and noninterest expense increased 1 million. 
 Fixed income of 47 million increased 7 million, driven by higher production as the market anticipated the decline in interest rates. Mortgage banking income of 8 million decreased 2 million, moderating slightly from home-buying season highs.

 3Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS (MD A) Table of Contents 

Pre-tax income in the Specialty Banking segment increased 15 million compared to third quarter 2023. Revenue increased 24 million, primarily driven by higher fixed income production. Noninterest expense increased 8 million, largely driven by higher incentive-based compensation expense tied to the improvement in fixed income production. 
 Pre-tax income of 342 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 46 million from the same period of 2023, largely reflecting a 47 million increase in noninterest income and a 9 million decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 19 million increase in noninterest expense. The increase in noninterest income was largely a result of higher fixed income and mortgage banking income. The increase in noninterest expense was largely attributable to higher personnel expense. 
 Corporate 
 Pre-tax loss for the Corporate segment was 114 million for third quarter 2024 compared to 99 million for second quarter 2024, largely reflecting a 14 million increase in noninterest expense. The increase in noninterest expense was largely attributable to 15 million in Visa derivative valuation expense. Results for third quarter 2024 also reflect 2 million in restructuring costs compared to 3 million in the prior quarter. 

Pre-tax loss for the Corporate segment was 114 million compared to 158 million for third quarter 2023, largely reflecting a 57 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a 10 million increase in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income was tied to the impact of funds transfer pricing. The increase in noninterest expense was largely driven by 15 million in derivative valuation expense as well as higher personnel expense. The increase in personnel expense was largely driven by higher salaries and employee benefits and deferred compensation expense, partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation. These increases in noninterest expense were partially offset by a decline in deposit insurance expense compared to third quarter 2023. 
 Pre-tax loss of 342 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 246 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in loss was largely driven by the 225 million gain on merger termination in 2023, offset by the 50 million contribution to the First Horizon Foundation. Results in 2024 also reflect a 51 million decrease in merger and integration related expense and 10 million in net FDIC special assessment expense. 

Analysis of Financial Condition 
 
 Earning assets consist of loans and leases, loans held for sale, investment securities, and other earning assets, such as trading securities and interest-bearing deposits with 

banks. A detailed discussion of the major components of earning assets is provided in the following sections. 

Loans and Leases 
 Period-end loans and leases of 62.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 billion, or 2 , compared to December 31, 2023. Commercial loans and leases increased 948 million, primarily from growth in loans to mortgage companies and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decline in other C I loans. Consumer loans increased 205 million, primarily from 

growth in real estate installment loans, partially offset by declines in HELOCs, consumer construction and other consumer loans. 
 The following table provides detail regarding FHN's loans and leases as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

Loans Held for Sale 
 Loans held for sale primarily consists of government guaranteed loans under SBA and USDA lending programs. Smaller amounts of other consumer and home equity loans are also included in loans HFS. Additionally, FHN's mortgage banking operations include origination and servicing of residential first lien mortgages that conform to standards established by GSEs that are major investors in U.S. home mortgages but can also consist of junior lien and jumbo loans secured by residential property. These non-conforming loans are primarily sold to private 

companies that are unaffiliated with the GSEs on a servicing-released basis. For further detail, see Note 5 - Mortgage Banking Activity to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report . 
 On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , l oans HFS were 494 million and 502 million, respectively. Held-for-sale consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in process of foreclosure totaled 2 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Asset Quality 
 
 Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition 
 FHN groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the ALLL is established and how credit risk is measured, monitored, and reported. From time to time, and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio, management may determine the ALLL at a more granular level. Commercial loans and leases are composed of C I loans and leases and CRE loans. Consumer loans are composed of consumer real es tate loans and credit card and other loans. FHN had a concentration of residential real estate 

loans of 22 and 23 of total loans at September 30, 2024 an d December 31, 2023, respectively. Industry concentrations are discussed un der the C I heading below. 
 Cr edit underwriting guidelines are outlined in Item 7 of FHN s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the Asset Quality section within the Analysis of Financial Condition discussion . F HN s credit underwriting guidelines and loan product offerings as of September 30, 2024 are generally consistent with those reported and disclosed in FHN s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolios 
 C I 
 C I loans are the largest component of the loan and lease portfolio, comprising 53 of total loans as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The C I portfolio increased 459 million to 33.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 32.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The C I portfolio is comprised of 

loans and leases used for general business purposes. Products offered in the C I portfolio include term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, direct financing and sales-type leases, working capital lines

of credit, and trade credit enhancement through letters of credit. 
 The increase in C I loans from December 31, 2023 was largely driven by growth in loans to mortgage companies partially offset by a decline in finance and insurance and various other portfolios. The largest geographical concentrations of balances in the C I portfolio as of September 30, 2024 were in Tennessee (20 ), Florida (12 ), Texas (11 ), North Carolina (7 ), Louisiana (6 ), California (6 ), and Georgia (5 ). No other state represented more than 5 of the portfolio. 
 The following table provides the composition of the C I portfolio by industry as of September 30, 2024 and 

December 31, 2023. For purposes of this disclosure, industries are determined based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry codes used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

Industry Concentrations 
 Loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditi ons. Loans to borro wers in the finance and insurance industry and loans to mortgage companies were 21 and 18 of FHN s C I loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and as a result could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services industry. Loans to borrowers in the real estate and rental and leasing industry were 11 and 12 of FHN's C I portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, FHN did not have any other concentrations of C I loans in any single industry of 10 or more of total loans. 
 Real Estate and Rental and Leasing 
 Loans to borrowers in the real estate and rental and leasing industry were 11 and 12 of FHN's C I portfolio 

as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This portfolio primarily consists of equipment financing loans and leases to clients across FHN's footprint in a broad range of industries and asset types. This portfolio also includes a smaller balance of loans and leases for solar and wind generating facilities. 
 Finance and Insurance 
 The finance and insurance component represented 11 and 12 of the C I portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and includes TRUPs (i.e., long-term unsecured loans to bank and insurance-related businesses), loans to bank holding companies, and asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. As of September 30, 2024, asset-based lending to consumer finance companies represented approximately 1.8 billion of the finance and insurance component. 
 Loans to Mortgage Companies 
 Loans to mortgage companie s were 10 and 6 of the C I portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,

2023, respectively. This portfolio inclu des commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower s sale of those mortgage loans to third-party investors. Balances in this portfolio generally fluctuate with mortgage rates and seasonal factors. Generally, new loan originations to mortgage lenders increase when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decrease when rates rise. In periods of economic uncertainty, this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining. In third quarter 2024, 78 of the loan originations were home purchases and 22 were refinance transactions. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate 
 The CRE portfolio tota led 14.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 14.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. The CRE 

portfolio includes financings for both commercial construction and non-construction loans. This por tfolio contains loans, draws on lines, and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and mini-perm anent financing of income-producing real estate. 
 The large st geographical concentr ations of CRE loan balances as of September 30, 2024 were in Florida (27 ), Texas (12 ), North Carolina (12 ), Georgia (10 ), Tennessee (9 ), and Louisiana (8 ). No other state represented more than 5 of the portfolio. 
 The following table represents subcategories of CRE loans by property type.

 Consumer Loan Portfolios 
 Consumer Real Estate 
 The consumer real estate p ortfolio totaled 14.0 billion and 13.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is primaril y composed of home equity lines and installment loans. The largest geographical co ncentrations of balances as of September 30, 2024 were in Florida (29 ), Tennessee (22 ), Texas (12 ), Louisiana (8 ), North Carolina (7 ), Georgia (5 ), and New York (5 ). No other state represented more than 5 of the portfolio. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 89 of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position. At origination, the weighted average FICO score of this portfolio was 759, and the refreshed FICO scores averaged 756 as of September 30, 2024, representing no change from FICO scores as of December 31, 2023. Generally, performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers finances, the level of unemployment, and home prices. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FHN had held-for-investment consumer mortgage loans secured by real estate that were in the process of foreclosure totaling 31 million and 29 million, respectively. 
 HELOCs compris ed 2.1 billion and 2.2 billion of the consumer real estate portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively . FHN s HELOCs typically have a 5 or 10 year draw period followed by a 10 or 20 year repayment period, respectively. During the draw period, a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments. The line is frozen if a borrower becomes past due on payments. Once the draw period has ended, the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest payments monthly until the loan matures. The principal payment generally is fully amortizing, but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate.

 3Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS (MD A) Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, approx imately 95 of FHN's HELOCs were in the draw period compared to 94 at December 31, 2023. It is expected that 583 million, or 29 , of HELOCs currently in the draw period will enter the repayment period during the next 60 months, based on current terms. Generally, d elinquencies for HELOCs that 

have entered the repayment period are initially higher than HELOCs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement. However, over time, performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize. HELOCs nearing the end of the draw perio d are closely monitored. 

The following table presents HELOCs currently in the draw period, broken down by months remaining in the draw period.

 Credit Card and Other 
 The credit card and other consumer loan portfolio totaled 687 million as of September 30, 2024 and 793 million as of December 31, 2023. This portfolio primarily consists of consumer-related credits, including home equity and 

other personal consumer loans, credit card receivables, and automobile loans. The 106 million decrease was primarily driven by net repayments in the overall portfolio. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The ACL is maintained at a level sufficient to provide appropriate reserves to absorb estimated future credit losses in accordance with GAAP . For additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 8 of FHN's 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The ALLL increased to 823 million as of September 30, 2024 from 773 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the ALLL balance as of September 30, 2024 reflects downgrades and an evolving macroeconomic 

outlook. The ALLL to total loans and leases ratio increased 6 basis points to 1.32 compared to 1.26 as of December 31, 2023. The ACL to total loans and leases ratio was 1.44 and 1.40 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The ACL to total loans and leases ratio increased modestly from 1.41 in second quarter 2024, driven by 8 million of qualitative reserves for Hurricane Helene and continued grade migration, partially offset by more favorable economic scenarios. 

Consolidated Net Charge-offs 
 Net charge-offs in third quarter 2024 were 24 million, or an annualized 15 basis points of total loans and leases, compared to net charge-offs of 95 million, or 61 basis 

points of total loans and leases, in third quarter 2023. Third quarter 2023 included a 72 million charge-off related to one client relationship in the C I portfolio.

Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, if impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or (on a case-by-case basis) if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccrual are loans for which FHN continues to receive payments, including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy. NPAs consist of nonperforming loans and OREO (excluding OREO from government insured mortgages). 
 Total NPAs (including NPLs HFS) increased to 585 million as of September 30, 2024 from 469 million as of 

December 31, 2023, largely driven by an increase in non-accrual CRE loans partially offset by a decline in nonaccrual consumer real estate loans. The increase in nonaccrual CRE loans was largely driven by multi-family and office property types. This portfolio continues to maintain strong underwriting and client selection. In addition, over 60 of the commercial nonaccrual loan balance was current on payments as of September 30, 2024. The vast majority of NPAs have individual impairment reviews with no specific reserve required. The nonperforming loans and leases ratio increased 17 basis points to 0.92 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 0.75 as of December 31, 2023.

 Potential problem assets represent those assets where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Federal banking regulators for loans classified as substandard. Potential problem assets in the loan portfolio increased to 

1.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 666 million as of December 31, 2023, reflecting an increase in commercial loans. This increase was largely attributable to grade migration in the multi-family and office portfolios. The current expectation of losses from potential problem assets has been included in management s analysis for assessing the adequ acy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. 

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 As part of FHN s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is 

unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies, Note 3 - Loans and Leases, and Note 4 - Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further discussion regarding troubled loan modifications.

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS (MD A) Table of Contents 

Commercial Loan Modifications 
 As part of FHN s credit risk management governance processes, the Loan Rehab and Recovery Department (LRRD) is responsible for managing most commercial relationships with borrowers whose financial condition has deteriorated to such an extent that the credits are individually reviewed for expected credit losses, classified as substandard or worse, placed on nonaccrual status, foreclosed or in process of foreclosure, or in active or contemplated litigation. LRRD has the authority and responsibility to enter into workout and/or rehabilitation agreements with troubled commercial borrowers in order to mitigate and/or minimize the amount of credit losses recognized from these problem assets. While every circumstance is different, LRRD will generally use forbearance agreements (generally 6-12 months) as an element of commercial loan workouts, which might include reduced interest rates, reduced payments, release of guarantor, term extensions or entering into short sale agreements. Principal forgiveness may be granted in specific workout circumstances. 
 The individual expected credit loss assessments completed on commercial loans are used in evaluating the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments to quantitatively modeled loss expectations for loans that are not considered collateral dependent. If a loan is collateral dependent, the carrying amount of a loan is written down to the net realizable value of the collateral. Each assessment considers any modified terms and is comprehensive to ensure appropriate assessment of expected credit losses. 
 Consumer Loan Modifications 
 FHN does not currently participate in any of the loan modification programs sponsored by the U.S. government but does generally structure modified consumer loans using the parameters of the former Home Affordable Modification Program. 

Within the HELOC and real estate installment loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment, troubled loans are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 1 for up to 5 years) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years, the interest rate generally returns to the original interest rate prior to modification; for certain modifications, the modified interest rate increases 2 per year until the original interest rate prior to modification is achieved. 
 Permanent mortgage troubled loans are typically modified by reducing the interest rate (in increments of 25 basis points to a minimum of 2 for up to 5 years) and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debt-to-income ratio. After 5 years, the interest rate steps up 1 every year until it reaches the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Weekly Survey Rate cap. Contractual maturities may be extended to 40 years on permanent mortgages and to 30 years for consumer real estate loans. 
 Within the credit card class of the consumer portfolio segment, troubled loans are typically modified through either a short-term credit card hardship program or a longer-term credit card workout program. In the credit card hardship program, borrowers may be granted rate and payment reductions for 6 months to 1 year. In the credit card workout program, clients are granted a rate reduction to 0 and term extensions for up to 5 years to pay off the remaining balance. 
 Consumer loans may also be modified through court-imposed principal reductions in bankruptcy proceedings, which FHN is required to honor unless a borrower reaffirms the related debt. 

Investment Securities 
 FHN s investment securities portfolio consists principally of debt securities available for sale. FHN maintains a securities portfolio consisting primarily of bank-eligible GSE and GNMA issued mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations . T he securities portfolio provides a source of income and liquidity and is an important tool used to balance the interest rate risk of the loan and deposit portfolios. The securities portfolio is periodically evaluated in light of established ALM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which FHN is exposed. These evaluations may result in steps taken to adjust the overall balance sheet positioning. 

Investment securities were 9.5 billion and 9.7 billion on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing 12 of total assets for both periods. For more information about the securities portfolio, see Note 2 - Investment Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

Deposits 
 Total deposits of 66.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 increased 795 million, or 1 , compared to December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased 1.8 billion and noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 992 million. 
 FHN continues to maintain a well-diversified and stable funding mix across its footprint and specialty lines of business. At September 30, 2024, commercial deposits were 37.3 billion, or 56 of total deposits, and consumer deposits were 29.3 billion, or 44 of total deposits. At December 31, 2023, commercial deposits were 35.9 billion, or 55 of total deposits, and consumer deposits were 29.9 billion, or 45 of total deposits. 
 At September 30, 2024, 37 of deposits were associated with Tennessee, 18 with Florida, 13 with North Carolina, and 12 with Louisiana, with no other state above 10 . This mix remained relatively consistent with December 31, 2023. 

Total estimated uninsured deposits were 26.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 26.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, representing 39 and 41 of total deposits, respectively. Of the uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024, 4.2 billion, or 6 of total deposits, were collateralized. At December 31, 2023, collateralized deposits were 5.3 billion, or 8 of total deposits.

Total short-term borrow ings increased to 3.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 3.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. FHLB borrowings increased 400 million and trading liabilities increased 258 million while securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased 310 million. 
 Short-term borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on the level of FHLB borrowing as a result of loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. 

Trading liabilities fluctuate based on various factors, including levels of trading securities and hedging strategies. Federal funds purchased fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of FHN s correspondent bank customers. Balances of securities sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate based on cost attractiveness relative to FHLB borrowing levels and the ability to pledge securities toward such transactions. 

Term Borrowings 
 Term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. Total term borrowings were 1.2 billion as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Capital 
 Management s objectives are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in FHN s businesses, to maintain excess capital to we ll-capitalized standards, and to ensure ready acc ess to the capital markets. 
 Total equity was 9.3 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Significant changes included net income of 624 million and an increase of 199 million in AOCI, offset by 462 million in common stock repurchases, 270 million in common and preferred 

dividends, and 100 million from the Series D Preferred Stock redemption.

 Banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators, should any depository institution s capital ratios decline below predetermined levels, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 
 The system categorizes a depository institution s capital position into one of five categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an institution the size of FHN to qualify as well-capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.50 , 8.00 , 10.00 , and 5.00 , respectively. Furthermore, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above these levels must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses. 
 As of September 30, 2024, both FHN and First Horizon Bank had sufficien t capital to qualify as well-capitalized instituti ons and to meet the capital conservation buffer 

requirement. Capital ratios for both FHN and First Horizon Bank are calculated under the final rule issued by the banking regulators in 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. 
 For both FHN and First Horizon Bank, the risk-based regulatory capital ratios decreased at the end of third quarter 2024 relative to year-end 2023 primarily from the impact of common share repurchases and an increase in risk-weighted assets. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio for FHN and First Horizon Bank decreased from year-end 2023 largely as a result of common share repurchases. The Series D Preferred Stock redemption in second quarter 2024 did not impact FHN's regulatory capital ratios as it did not qualify as Tier 1 capital because the earliest redemption date was less than five years from the issuance date. 
 For the remainder of 2024 and in 2025, capital ratios are expected to remain above well-capitalized standards plus the required capital conservation buffer. 

Common Stock Purchases 
 FHN may purchase shares of its common stock from time to time, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. FHN's Board has authorized the common stock purchase program described below. FHN s Board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program. 

January 2024 General Purchase Program 
 On January 23, 2024, FHN announced that its Board of Directors had approved a 650 million common share purchase program that was scheduled to expire on January 31, 2025. Purchases could be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions,

including under Rule 10b5-1 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions. The timing and exact amount of common share repurchases were at the discretion of senior management and were subject to various factors, including FHN's capital position, financial performance, expected capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, business conditions, and regulatory considerations. Absent a Rule 10b5-1 plan, FHN did not intend to purchase shares under this program during blackout periods when senior 

executives were prohibited from purchasing FHN stock on the open market. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 441 million in purchases had been made life-to-date under the 2024 program at an average price per share of 15.03, or 15.01 excluding commissions. Program purchases made during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are summarized in the following table.

 October 2024 General Purchase Program 
 On October 29, 2024, FHN announced that its Board of Directors had approved a new 1.0 billion common share purchase program to replace the January 2024 program discussed above. The new October program is scheduled to expire on January 31, 2026. The January 2024 program discussed above was terminated effective the close of business on October 29, 2024. Purchases under the new program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions. The timing and exact amount of common share repurchases are at the discretion of senior management and are subject to various factors, including FHN's capital position, financial performance, expected capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, business conditions, and 

regulatory considerations. Absent a Rule 10b5-1 plan, FHN does not purchase shares under this program during blackout periods when senior executives are prohibited from purchasing FHN stock on the open market. 
 Stock Award Purchases 
 As authorized by the Board's Compensation Committee, FHN makes automatic stock purchases by withholding stock-based award shares to cover tax obligations associated with those awards. Those limited, off-market purchases are not associated with an announced purchase program and are made any time an associated tax obligation arises, whether or not a blackout period is in effect. Tax withholding purchases made during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are summarized in the following table.

Risk Management 
 
 There have been no significant changes to FHN s risk management practices as described under Risk Management included in Item 7 of FHN s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Market Risk Management 
 Value-at-Risk and Stress Testing 
 VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level. FHN employs a model to compute daily VaR measures for its trading securities inventory. FHN computes VaR using historical simulation with a 1-year 

lookback period at a 99 confidence level with 1-day and 10-day time horizons. Additionally, FHN computes a Stressed VaR measure. The SVaR computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio. 

A summary of FHN s VaR and SVaR measures for 1-day and 10-day time horizons is presented in the following table: 
 Table I.2.21

FHN s overall VaR measure includes both interest rate risk and credit spread risk. Separate measures of these component risks are as follows: 
 Table I.2.22 
 SCHEDULE OF RISKS INCLUDED IN VaR 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2023 As of December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day Interest rate risk 1 2 1 1 2 Credit spread risk 1 1 2 3 1 1 

The potential risk of loss reflected by FHN s VaR measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static. Because FHN Financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients, its trading securities inventory turns over regularly. Additionally, FHNF traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day. Accordingly, FHNF s trading securities inventory is highly dynamic, rather than static. As a result, it would be rare for FHNF to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its VaR measures. 
 In addition to being used in FHN s daily market risk management process, the VaR and SVaR measures are also used by FHN in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the Market Risk Capital rules. For additional information regarding FHN's capital adequacy refer to the Capital section of this MD A. 
 FHN also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios. Key assumed stresses used in those tests are: 
 Down 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 
 Up 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 
 Curve flattening - assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in short-term rates and a decrease in long-term rates. The 

2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 
 Curve steepening - assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in short-term rates and an increase in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 
 Credit spread widening - assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads (the difference between yields on Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities) of 25 basis points. 
 Model Validation 
 Trading risk management personnel within FHN have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by FHN to compute its VaR measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory. Among other procedures, these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model. These model risk management activities are subject to annual review by FHN s Model Validation Group, an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for FHN s model risk management. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 
 Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 
 The information provided in this section, including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis, is forward-looking. Actual results, if the assumed scenarios were to occur, could differ because of interest rate movements, the ability of management to execute its business plans, and other factors, including those presented in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this Report. 

Management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning, earnings, or both, within FHN s interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital guidelines. Interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting 12 months of NII under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in NII for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged. Assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition, interest rate movements, and loan and 

101 
 3Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS (MD A) Table of Contents 

deposit pricing. In addition, assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals. The results of these scenarios help FHN develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. While management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable, simulation modeling provides only an estimate, not a precise calculation, of exposure to any given change in interest rates. 
 Based on a static balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, NII expo sures over the next 12 months, assuming rate shocks of plus/minus 25 basis points, plus/minus 50 basis points, plus/minus 100 basis points, and plus/minus 200 basis points are estimated to have variances as shown in the table below. 
 Table I.2.23 
 INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY 
 Shifts in Interest Rates (in bps) Change in Projected Net Interest Income -200 (5.9) -100 (2.6) -50 (1.3) -25 (0.6) +25 0.5 +50 1.0 +100 2.0 +200 3.4 

A steepening yield curve scenario, where long-term rates increase by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in a favorable NII variance of 0.3 . A flattening yield curve scenario, where long-term rates decrease by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in an unfavorable NII variance of 0.4 . These hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework, and do not necessarily represent management s current view of future interest rates or market developments. 
 Short-term interest rates had reached their highest levels in 15 years prior to September 2024's 50 basis point rate cut. Coupled with market disruption from recent high profile bank failures, this high interest rate environment has increased competitive pressures on deposit costs. 
 The yield curve was inverted for much of the last half of 2022, throughout 2023, and during the first eight months of 2024 before flattening in September 2024. An inverted yield curve indicates market expectations that short-term rates have likely peaked and then could decline in future periods. Following the 50 basis point rate cut in September 2024 and a 25 basis point cut in November, market participants are now projecting zero or one further 25 basis point rate cut in 2024 with an additional two to four cuts projected in 2025. FHN continues to monitor current economic trends and potential exposures closely. For additional information, see Yield Curve within Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends below. 

Liquidity Risk Management 
 Among other things, ALCO is responsible for liquidity management: the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration, while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs. ALCO and the Board of Directors have adopted a Liquidity Policy of which the objective is to ensure that FHN meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly, in a cost-effective manner and with the highest degree of reliability. The maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide FHN with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs. Key liquidity ratios, asset liquidity levels, and the amount available from funding sources are reported to ALCO on a regular basis. FHN s Liquidity Policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for FHN s risk profile. 
 
 In accordance with the Liquidity Policy, ALCO manages FHN s exposure to liquidity risk through forecasts of its 

liquidity position and funding needs. Base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by ALCO and are updated as financial conditions dictate. In addition to the baseline liquidity reports, robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed. FHN maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects FHN, the industry, or both. As of September 30, 2024, available liquidity sources included cash, incremental borrowing capacity at the FHLB, access to Federal Reserve Bank borrowings through the discount window, and unencumbered securities. Additional sources of liquidity included dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements, access to the overnight and term Federal Funds markets, brokered deposits, loan sales, and syndications. The table below details FHN's sources of available liquidity at September 30, 2024.

 Generally, a primary source of funding for a bank is core deposits from the bank's client base. The period-end loans-to-deposits ratio was 94 as of September 30, 2024 and 93 as of December 31, 2023. 
 FHN may also use unsecured short-term borrowings as a source of liquidity. Federal funds purchased from correspondent bank clients are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long, historical, and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by FHN to these correspondent banks. The remainder of FHN s wholesale short-term borrowings consists of securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with business clients or broker dealer counterparties. 
 Both FHN and First Horizon Bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing senior or subordinated unsecured debt, preferred equity, and common equity, subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. As of September 30, 2024 , FHN had outstanding 798 million in senior and subordinated unsecured debt and 426 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. FHN redeemed all outstanding shares of its Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock during second quarter 2024. As of September 30, 2024, First Horizon Bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of 295 million, which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries. These sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of FHN. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules, the Bank s total amount available for dividends was 1.0 billion as of October 1, 2024. 

First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of 310 million in first quarter 2024, 150 million in second quarter 2024, 350 million in third quarter 2024, and 300 million in fourth quarter 2024. Total common dividends of 220 million were declared and paid to the parent company in 2023. First Horizon Bank declared and paid preferred dividends in the first three quarters of 2024 and in 2023. Additionally, First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in fourth quarter 2024, payable in January 2025. 
 Payment of a dividend to shareholders of FHN is dependent on several factors which are considered by the Board. These factors include FHN s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, applicable regulatory restrictions (including capital conservation buffer requirements) and availability of funds to FHN through a dividend from First Horizon Bank. Additionally, banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings. Consequently, the decision of whether FHN will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results. 
 FHN paid a cash dividend of 0.15 per common share on October 1, 2024. FHN paid cash dividends of 1,625 per Series E preferred share and 1,175 per Series F preferred share on October 10, 2024 and 165 per Series C preferred share on November 1, 2024. In addition, in October 2024, the Board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts:

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the normal course of business, FHN is a party to a number of activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments. FHN enters into commitments to extend credit to borrowers, including loan commitments, lines of credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit. Many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used; therefore, the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Based on its available 

103 
 3Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS (MD A) Table of Contents 

liquidity and available borrowing capacity, FHN anticipates it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments. 

Repurchase Obligations 
 Prior to September 2008, legacy First Horizon originated loans through its pre-2009 mort gage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. FHN's principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to (i) indemnification claims by underwriters, loan purchasers, and other parties which assert that FHN-originated loans caused or contributed to losses which FHN is legally obliged to indemnify, and (ii) indemnification or other claims related to FHN's servicing of pre-2009 mortgage loans. 

FHN s approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved, sometimes substantially, based on changes in information available. Repurchase/make-whole rates vary based on purchaser, vintage, and claim type. For those loans repurchased or covered by a make-whole payment, cumulative average loss severities range between 50 and 60 percent of the UPB. 

Repurchase Accrual Approach 
 In determining potential loss content, claims are analyzed by purchaser, vintage, and claim type. FHN considers various inputs including claim rate estimates, historical average repurchase and loss severity rates, mortgage insurance cancellations, and mortgage insurance curtailment requests. Inputs are applied to claims in the 

active pipeline, as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows. Management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers and/or servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 
 As discussed in Note 10 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, FHN s repurchase and foreclosure liability, primarily related to its pre-2009 mortgage origination, sale, securitization, and servicing businesses, is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline, estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The active pipeline consists of mortgage loan repurchase and make-whole demands from loan purchasers or securitization participants, foreclosure/servicing demands from borrowers, and certain related exposures. The liability contemplates repurchase/make-whole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred 

losses associated with loan populations excluded from the settlements with the GSEs, as well as other whole loans sold, mortgage insurance cancellation rescissions, and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the GSEs. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. The total repurchase and foreclosure liability, which includes both the legacy pre-2009 business and the current mortgage business, was 15 million and 16 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively . 

Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends 
 FHN s future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends. Key among those are changes in the U.S. and global economy and outlook, government actions affecting interest rates, and government actions and proposals which could have positive or negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses, industries, or sectors. Additional risks relate to political uncertainty, changes in federal policies (including those publicly discussed, formally 

proposed, or recently implemented) and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients, and whether FHN s strategic initiatives will succeed. 
 In addition to trends and events noted elsewhere in this MD A, FHN believes the following trends and events are noteworthy at this time.

 Economic Overview 
 The post-COVID economy in the U.S. has been marked by: strong inflation, which began in 2021, peaked in 2022, and abated, though not fully, starting in 2023; the Federal Reserve "tightening" in 2022 and the first half of 2023 to contain inflation by rapidly increasing short-term interest rates and ending asset purchases; low unemployment rates; moderate economic growth; and a profoundly inverted yield curve. Key aspects were: 
 Although the U.S. economy flirted with recession in 2022, it did not officially enter one. In 2023 recession concerns moderated significantly. In 2024, recession expectations have remained generally low. 
 The rise in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in 2022 was both rapid and substantial, taking the overnight Fed Funds rate from 0.20 in March 2022 to 4.65 a year later. Hikes after that were much more modest and infrequent. 
 In 2023 the Federal Reserve signaled an end to hikes. No rate actions were taken for more than a year, until a 50 basis point cut in September 2024. Future actions continue to depend upon future data. 
 In response to 2022's extremely rapid and vigorous tightening of monetary policy, the inflation rate in the U.S. now is well below 2022's levels. However, measures of inflation generally remain higher than the Federal Reserve's stated long-term goal of 2 . 
 Monetary tightening often creates yield curve inversion for a time. In the current cycle, traditional inversion (when ten-year treasury rates are below two-year rates) was both very deep and unusually sustained, with inversion lasting from the summer of 2022 to September 2024. 
 Key events and circumstances are noted in the following discussions. 
 Federal Reserve and Rates 
 The Federal Reserve raised short-term rates several times in 2022 and in the first part of 2023. All but one of the raises in 2022 were 75 and 50 basis points each aggressive by historical standards while the 2023 raises were the more-typical 25 basis points each. The Federal Reserve cut rates 50 basis points in September 2024 and 25 basis points in November 2024. 
 FHN cannot predict exactly when or how much short-term rates will be changed, how market-driven long-term rates will behave, nor how those actions may affect financial markets during the next several quarters. 
 Yield Curve 
 Unusual yield curve effects, including inversion, are common when monetary policy changes. A traditional 

measure of inversion occurs when the two-year U.S. Treasury rate is higher than the ten-year rate. Traditional inversion was sustained continuously from the summer of 2022 until September 2024, an unusually long period. The degree of inversion varied during that period, but often was much deeper than is typical. Sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed, with statistical support, as a harbinger of economic recession, but recession did not occur. 
 Early in the fourth quarter of 2024, the yield curve is relatively flat, meaning the two-year U.S. Treasury rate is only modestly lower than the ten-year rate. 
 Yield curve flattening and inversion generally reduces the profit FHN can make from lending by compressing FHN's net interest margin, and also generally reduces FHN's revenues from bond trading. Both of those impacts occurred over the past two years, with fluctuations. Refer to Interest Rate Yield Curve Risks , located in Item 1A. Risk Factors of FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, f or a discussion of the risks to FHN associated with flattening and inversion. 
 Recession 
 The U.S. economy contracted (experienced negative growth) during the first two quarters of 2022, in both cases modestly. Although the occurrence of two consecutive quarters of contraction often coincides with recession, in 2022 it did not. The economy has expanded in each quarter since then. The expansion rate has varied without a sustained trend. 
 Recession expectations in the U.S. were high in 2022 and early 2023. They moderated significantly after that. In 2024 recession expectations have fluctuated but generally have remained low. 
 Fiscal Policy 
 The Federal Reserve controls monetary policy for the U.S. government, but not fiscal policy (spending and taxation). Fiscal policy directly affects U.S. government annual deficits or surpluses, along with the size and trajectory of the national debt. Fiscal policy often has a significant impact on the U.S. economy. Some of the unusual or unexpected aspects of the post-COVID economy likely were created or supported by historically unusual fiscal stimulus and other stimulative policies which pushed, and in some cases continue to push, substantial amounts of money into the economy. 
 The federal elections in November 2024 could result in significant changes in U.S. fiscal policy in 2025 and 2026. 
 2023 Banking Crisis 
 In March 2023, two large regional U.S. banks failed after sudden large deposit outflows, and a major Swiss bank was acquired by another bank at the behest of regulators.

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS (MD A) Table of Contents 

In May 2023, a third large regional U.S. bank failed after experiencing very large deposit outflows in March. In the aftermath of these failures, bank investors and clients across the U.S. became more focused on deposit mix, funding risk management, and other safety-soundness concerns. Most U.S. banks saw abrupt net outflows of deposits in the spring of 2023 following the failures. Most have since recouped those deposits, mainly by offering higher interest rates. In 2024, competition for deposits has been quite intense. 
 Impacts on FHN 
 In 2022, FHN benefited significantly from rising rates as the rise in lending rates outpaced the rise in deposit and other funding rates. In the first quarter of 2023, that outpacing ended, and FHN's net interest margin (NIM) started to compress. FHN was able to reverse the compression during 2023 fueled in part by using increased deposits and capital to reduce more-expensive borrowings. FHN's NIM further improved in the first half of 2024 compared with the second half of 2023. Third quarter NIM contracted modestly while remaining higher than in 2023. 
 In 2024 through third quarter, improvements in loan yields have been largely offset by higher funding costs, especially for deposits. Deposit costs have increased 

largely in response to heightened competition in many of FHN's markets. Although that competitive environment is expected to continue, rate cuts are expected to moderate funding costs, especially as old commitments expire. A key uncertainty is whether rate cuts will impact loan yields as strongly as funding costs, and at the same times. 
 In addition, some of FHN's businesses have been negatively impacted by rate actions in the past two years and by the unusual yield curve. Rate increases pushed home mortgage rates in the U.S. much higher in 2022 and 2023, reducing demand. FHN's direct mortgage lending and lending to mortgage companies saw business decline significantly in 2022 and 2023. Mortgage rates modestly abated in 2024 through third quarter, and FHN's related businesses improved, but long-term rates remain well above the lows of a few years ago and even have trended upward since late in the third quarter. Moreover, FHN's revenues from bond trading and related activities fell significantly in 2022 and 2023 due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility. In 2024, bond trading revenues have improved markedly, but with significant volatility quarter-to-quarter. Bond revenues likely have fluctuated due to changing market expectations about rate moves, among other things. 

Other Regulatory Proposals 
 In 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and other regulators proposed regulatory changes that would, if implemented, significantly increase regulatory constraints and costs on all U.S. banks with assets over 100 billion. A few new requirements would apply to banks, like FHN, with assets over 50 billion, but by far the main impacts would fall on banks greater than 100 billion in assets. 
 The proposals touch upon many regulatory requirements, including debt and equity capital requirements, credit risk standards, asset risk-weighting, and resolution planning. The increased requirements also would entail additional compliance costs. 
 The triggering of significant cost increases based on a single threshold financial measure 100 billion in assets 

has been in place for many years and has impacted the U.S. banking industry. Compliance restrictions and costs increase as the threshold is approached but a step-up pattern remains. Those effects have added to the incentives for banks to consolidate, and the proposed new rules are likely to enhance that. 
 It appears likely that, if adopted as proposed, significant parts of the proposals will be challenged in court as being inconsistent with legislation enacted by Congress in 2018. Such a challenge would be technical and complex, and likely would take many years to resolve. Moreover, even if a challenge of that sort were successful, many parts of the proposals likely would remain intact and others might be modified without being rescinded. 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reporting Regimes 
 In October 2023, the state of California enacted laws which, taken together, will require most larger companies doing business in California to report annually their greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, with an external assurance requirement, and to report biennially their climate-related financial risks and risk-mitigation measures. The California laws include multi-year phase in periods and encompass Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG emissions. As currently enacted, the laws require implementing regulations to be adopted by July 1, 2025, 

and reporting for Scopes 1 and 2 to begin in 2026 for the 2025 fiscal year. 
 In March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted final rules, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors (the SEC Climate Disclosures Rules ). These Rules would require all U.S. companies with publicly-traded securities to report annually their Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and related risk management processes, and would include a related financial statement 

106 
 3Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS (MD A) Table of Contents 

and audit requirement, among other things. Refer to "Accounting Changes" below for additional information. The SEC Climate Disclosures Rules also have a lengthy phase-in period. 
 Europe also has adopted a GHG reporting regime. It is not applicable to FHN and is not further discussed here. 
 Three GHG Scopes 
 Scope 1 GHG emissions are those from a source the company owns or controls directly, such as a manufacturing plant. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from company activities, such as from power consumed by company operations. Scope 1 and 2 emissions generally can be measured or estimated using information a company normally can obtain without significant external inquiry. 
 Scope 3 GHG emissions are those from sources and activities that a company neither owns nor controls. Scope 3 emissions are from a wide range of sources that touch upon a company, such as: vendors; employees (commuting, business travel, etc.); and customers. Scope 3 information generally is unknown to a company without significant external inquiry and/or estimation. 
 Potential Business Impacts 
 Direct compliance costs will include creating systems to measure or estimate and capture relevant data, staffing, and engagement of vendors, including a firm to provide required assurances (somewhat analogous to a financial statement auditor). 
 Potentially of more significance: California may require inquiry of customers rather than mere estimation about them. If FHN is allowed merely to estimate emissions from customers, that process may be costly but would not interfere with its business relationships. If, however, FHN is required to support Scope 3 reporting by obtaining 

GHG-related information from customers, including customers that are not public companies and that do no business in California, then the California disclosure laws could interfere with FHN's business. In that case, effectively FHN would be required to impose costs and/or inconveniences on its customers. Other banks in FHN's markets, particularly those that are private and not doing business in California, could provide financial services without those requirements, putting FHN at a competitive disadvantage. 
 Legal Challenges 
 The California laws, especially the application of those laws to companies outside of California, have been challenged in court. Challengers assert that the laws, among other things, unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce, are pre-empted by federal law, and unconstitutionally compel or burden speech. Challenges could take many years to resolve. A key practical question will be whether the courts maintain a legal stay (a moratorium) on these laws nationwide while challenges are pending. 
 The SEC Climate Disclosures rules likewise are being challenged in court. Challengers assert, among other things, that the SEC lacks explicit Congressional authorization to create a regulatory reporting regime pertaining to GHG emissions. The several challenges have been consolidated in the U.S. (federal) 8th Circuit. Possibly anticipating a court-ordered stay, the SEC has suspended the effectiveness of its rules while the court challenges are pending. 
 Assuming that the various legal challenges leave the SEC Climate Disclosures Rules entirely or largely intact, the California laws might be further challenged by public companies as having been pre-empted by the SEC Rules. 

Market Growth and Weather Events 
 FHN's principal markets are in the southern and southeastern United States, including most of the major gulf coast markets and several markets on the southern Atlantic seacoast. Many of FHN's markets, both coastal and non-coastal, have experienced significant population growth over at least the past twenty years, outpacing the growth rate for the U.S. as a whole. That population growth generally has been accompanied by economic growth. 
 Many of FHN's fastest growing markets, including most significantly those in Florida, can be impacted significantly by hurricanes and other severe coastal weather events. As those markets grow, FHN's economic commitment to them grows, as does FHN's financial exposure to those events. 
 Over the past two years it has been widely reported that the economic costs of hurricane and other severe weather 

events in the southeastern U.S. have been rising significantly. FHN believes that rising costs are directly related to growth in those areas. 
 For example, much of the growth in Florida has been along the coast moving out from older cities. A gulf coast hurricane 50 or 60 years ago had a fair chance of making landfall in a relatively unpopulated area. Now, the chances of directly hitting a population center are much higher, the average population in that center is much higher, and the average value per building is much higher. 
 The reported significant increase in casualty risks and costs is being reflected in property insurance practices which currently are in significant flux. The insurance industry is being forced to revise its risk assessment and premium pricing practices in coastal and other impacted areas as loss experience has deviated from earlier predictions, sometimes badly. In Florida, for example, 

107 
 3Q24 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

PART I, ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS (MD A) Table of Contents 

some smaller carriers have failed, some larger carriers have left markets, and remaining carriers have significantly increased the premiums of hurricane-related insurance, narrowed coverage, or both. 
 Coastal states such as Florida and Louisiana have created last-resort insurance pools for residents who cannot obtain or afford private property insurance. However, as the costs borne by those pools increase, either the premiums will have to rise or general taxation will have to cover the difference. In addition, those programs generally do not help business clients, nor are they offered in many states that can be severely impacted by hurricane-related flooding. 
 State and local building and water-control codes are being revised, but often unevenly and often not retroactive to 

pre-existing structures and developments. The current transition period could be lengthy. 
 The availability, reliability, and cost of adequate property insurance is a significant concern for FHN as well as FHN's clients in affected markets. Instability in property insurance has made, and continues to make, FHN's business decisions more difficult. That instability increases FHN's risks of loan loss and business downturn. 
 More fundamentally, elevated insurance and casualty costs blunt a key factor driving growth in many of these high-growth markets: lower costs of living. If market growth slows, FHN's business could be impacted. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 FHN has made no significant changes in its critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in its 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Accounting Changes 
 In March 2024, the SEC adopted its Climate Disclosures Rules (refer to "Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reporting Regimes" above). Those Rules, when effective, will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. Information required for inclusion within the footnotes to the financial statements for severe weather events and other natural conditions includes 1) income statement effects before insurance recoveries above 1 of pre-tax income/loss, 2) balance sheet effects above 1 of shareholders equity, and 3) certain carbon offsets and renewable energy credits. Qualitative discussion is also required for material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that are due to severe weather events and other natural conditions or disclosed climate-related targets or transition plans. 
 Disclosures that are outside the financial statements include 1) Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, if material, 2) how the Board of Directors oversees the assessment and management of climate-related risks, 3) management s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks if the risks are material, 4) climate-related risks that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, including whether the risks are expected to manifest in the short term (i.e., next 12 months) and, separately, in the long term (i.e., beyond the next 12 months), 5) if a registrant has adopted a plan to manage material climate transition risks, the plan should be described and updated annually to specify its progress toward completing the transition plan, including any actions taken under the plan and how those actions 

have affected the registrant s business, results of operations, or financial condition, 6) if a registrant has adopted a plan to manage material climate transition risks, the plan should be described and updated annually to specify its progress toward completing the transition plan, including any actions taken under the plan and how those actions have affected the registrant s business, results of operations, or financial condition, 7) quantitative price disclosures if a registrant uses an internal carbon price (e.g., a monetary cost assigned to carbon emissions for budgeting, forecasting, or performance management) and this use is material to how it evaluates material climate-related risks, 8) if a registrant uses a scenario analysis to assess its business in the context of climate-related risks and, on the basis of that analysis, determines that a climate-related risk is reasonably likely to have a material impact, the registrant must describe each scenario, including the parameters, assumptions, and projected financial impacts, 9) the registrant's processes for identifying, assessing and managing material climate-related risks, 10) information about the registrant's publicly announced or internal climate-related targets or goals if they materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant's business, results of operations, or financial condition (e.g., expenditures or operational changes needed to meet the targets or goals) and 11) quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that, in management s assessment, directly result from activities to mitigate or adapt to material climate-related risks.

In April 2024, the SEC issued a stay of the Climate Disclosures Rules pending the completion of judicial review of various legal challenges. Therefore, the actual timing of the implementation of the Climate Disclosure Rules, if sustained through the judicial process, is uncertain. FHN is assessing the potential effects of the Climate Disclosure Rules on its registration statements and annual reports.

Exhibit 10.1 

RATE APPLICABLE TO PARTICIPATING 
 DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
 UNDER THE DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVES 
 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN 
 
 (As in effect for 2025) 
 
 Effective for the 2025 plan year, the Board of Directors and its Compensation Committee approved an applicable interest rate of 12.25 for the Directors and Executives Deferred Compensation Plan. That rate increased from the 12.04 rate in effect for 2024, and applies prospectively to certain participants, including all participants who presently are directors or officers of First Horizon Corporation or its subsidiaries. Rates are subject to annual approval by the Board, but generally remain in effect until changed. The new interest rate, within the context of the entire Plan, has been established at a level intended to provide both retention and long-term non-compete incentives. When a participant retires after 2010 due to mandatory retirement, the participant s interest rate during retirement will be the highest rate in place over the past three years that is, the highest of the rates applicable during the year of retirement and the previous two years.
