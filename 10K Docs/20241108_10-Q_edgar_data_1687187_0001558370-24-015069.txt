The amended facility (the Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of May 3, 2029, and provides an initial aggregate revolving commitment of million as well as an accordion feature to increase the size by an additional million subject to certain terms and conditions, including lenders consent. Prior to the First Amendment Agreement, the facility had a maturity date of February 15, 2026, and an initial aggregate revolving commitment of million as well as an accordion feature of million. The borrowing base of the amended facility at September 30, 2024 was million based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory collateral and reserve requirements. The remaining availability under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2024, after million of outstanding borrowings, was million. Revolving loans under the amended facility bear interest at either the base rate plus or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus . The base rate equals the highest of the administrative agent s prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus , or . The terms of the Revolving Credit Facility include covenants limiting the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, and enter into transactions with affiliates.

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair values of the Company s Senior Notes were based on observable market prices and were considered a Level 2 measurement based on trading volumes. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the Company s remaining debts is not material due to the similarity between the terms of the debt agreements and prevailing market terms available to the Company. Current Portion of Long-term Debt The Company s short-term debt at September 30, 2024 was comprised of million due under equipment loans. The Company s short-term debt at December 31, 2023 was comprised of million borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was repaid shortly after the December 31, 2023 balance sheet date using funds from current operations, million of unpaid financing associated with the Maben Coal Acquisition, and million due under equipment loans. Other Finance lease obligations and liabilities related to insurance premium financing are excluded from the disclosures above. million and various other liabilities. Accrued liabilities at December 31, 2023 consisted of million of accrued compensation and various other liabilities. The year-to-date decrease of million in Accrued liabilities was largely related to the million decrease in cash dividends and short-term dividend equivalents liabilities, which was driven by the payment of Class A common stock dividends accrued at year end 2023. Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation claims and occupational disease obligations under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended, as well as for employee medical expenses. The Company purchases insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to significant levels of these claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date using claims data and actuarial assumptions and, therefore, are subject to uncertainty due to a variety of factors. The estimated aggregate liability for these items totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the aggregate liability, the amounts included in Other long-term liabilities were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Funds held in escrow for potential future workers compensation claims are considered restricted cash and have been included in other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash balances were million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. shares of Class B common stock for every share of existing common stock held on the record date. Similar actions or modifications occurred for holders of outstanding stock-based awards. The distribution of the Class B common stock provides existing holders of the Company s common stock with an opportunity to participate directly in the financial performance of the Company s CORE assets on a stand-alone basis, separate from the Company s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were acquired initially as part of the Company s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022. The financial performance of CORE assets consists of the following non-cost bearing revenue streams based on the Company s current expectations:

 of Company-produced coal sales revenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox Creek, Infrastructure fees based on per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and per ton of loaded coal at the Company s rail load-out facilities, and Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced carbon products as well as rare earth elements and critical minerals initiatives. The Company has paid dividends equal to of the total fees above; however, any dividend amounts declared and paid are subject to the sole discretion of the Company s Board of Directors. In addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add expense allocation policies related to CORE, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Holders of shares of Class A common stock continue to be entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to outstanding preferred stock, if any. CORE is not a separate legal entity, and holders of Class B common stock do not own a direct interest in the assets of CORE. Holders of Class B common stock are stockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc. and are subject to all risks and liabilities of the Company as a whole. With respect to voting rights, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders and are entitled to vote per share. The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Class B common stock does not have any specific voting rights or governance rights with respect to CORE. With respect to liquidation rights, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available for distribution to the stockholders after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock, if any. That is, the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation are equal between holders of Class A and Class B common stock. Holders of Class B common stock do not have specific rights to CORE assets in the event of liquidation. The Board of Directors also retains the ability, in its sole discretion, to exchange all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by a -day trailing volume-weighted average price for each class of stock. The initial distribution of the tracking stock was recorded as a stock dividend at fair value, which was estimated to be per share based on the closing price of Class B shares on the first day of regular-way trading. The effect of the equity restructuring was a million reduction in retained earnings and an increase of million to Class B common stock and additional paid-in capital during the second quarter of 2023. Outstanding stock-based awards were reclassified to Class A common stock as part of the equity restructuring. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Company s outstanding stock-based awards, equitable adjustments were made in accordance with such terms based on the same factor of for every outstanding award. Since there were no changes in fair value, vesting conditions, or award classification, no incremental compensation expense resulted. Stock-Based Awards Stock-based compensation expense totaled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense totaled million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During 2024, the Company granted new stock-based awards and modified certain awards previously granted as discussed below. New stock-based awards granted during the first nine months of 2024 were for Class A common stock, all of which were granted in the first quarter of 2024. There were Class B stock-based awards granted during the first nine months of 2024. Restricted Stock We granted shares of Class A restricted stock to certain senior executives, key employees, and directors during the first quarter of 2024, having a grant-date fair value of million. The aggregate

 million, which is recognized ratably as expense over the service period unless forfeited. The aggregate fair value of restricted stock granted to directors was million, which is recognized ratably as expense over unless forfeited. During the vesting period, the participants have voting rights and receive nonforfeitable dividends on the same basis as fully vested common stockholders. Restricted Stock Units RSUs We granted Class A restricted stock units to certain senior executives and key employees during the first quarter of 2024, having a grant-date fair value of per share. The aggregate fair value of these awards was million, which is recognized ratably as expense over the service period unless forfeited. During the vesting period, the participants have voting rights and dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units vest. The recipient will receive share of Class A common stock for each stock unit vested. Performance Stock Units PSUs We granted Class A performance stock units to certain senior executives and key employees during the first quarter of 2024. These awards cliff-vest approximately from the date of grant based on the achievement of targeted performance levels related to pre-established relative total shareholder return goals. These performance stock units may be earned from to of target depending on actual results. During the vesting period, the participants have voting rights and dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units vest. The recipient will receive share of Class A common stock for each stock unit vested. Performance stock units are accounted for as awards with a market condition since vesting depends on total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies. The target number of performance stock units granted during the first quarter of 2024, or units, were valued relative to the total shareholder return of a peer group based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which resulted in a grant date fair value of per unit. The aggregate fair value of these awards was million, which is recognized ratably as expense over the period. Modification The resignation of one of the Company s executive officers and the separation agreement between the employee and the Company that occurred during the first quarter of 2024 resulted in a net charge to stock compensation expense of million during the period. Incremental value of million resulted from the continued equity vesting provision included in the separation agreement applicable to the employee s restricted stock awards, which was recognized as expense. This amount was offset partially by the million reversal of previously recognized compensation expense related to the pre-modified restricted stock award million) as well as the forfeiture of restricted stock units and performance stock units (collectively million).

Losses from certain injury-related matters are reasonably possible of occurring; however, an estimate of the possible range of loss cannot be made at this time as such litigation has not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and development of important facts and legal issues. On November 5, 2018, of our raw coal storage silos that fed our Elk Creek plant experienced a partial structural failure. A temporary conveying system completed in late-November 2018 restored approximately of our plant capacity. We completed a permanent belt workaround and restored the preparation plant to its full processing capacity in mid-2019. Our insurance carrier, Federal Insurance Company, disputed our claim for coverage based on certain exclusions to the applicable policy and, therefore, on August 21, 2019, we filed suit against Federal Insurance Company and Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. in Logan County Circuit Court in West Virginia seeking a declaratory judgment that the partial silo collapse was an insurable event and to require coverage under our policy. Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, and upon removal, we

 million in contract damages and on July 16, 2021, made an additional award of million for damages for wrongful denial of the claim under Hayseeds, Inc. v. State Farm Fire Cas. , 177 W. Va. 323, 352 S.E. 2d 73 (W. Va. 1986), including inconvenience and aggravation. On August 12, 2021, the defendants filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative to alter or amend the judgment or for a new trial. On March 4, 2022, the court entered its memorandum opinion and order on the motion reducing the jury award to a total of million, including pre-judgment interest, and also vacated and set aside, in its entirety, the jury award of Hayseeds damages. The same day, the court entered the judgment in accordance with the memorandum opinion and order. On April 1, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On July 20, 2023, the court rendered a decision reinstating the jury s million contract damages verdict. The court further determined that we are entitled to attorney s fees in an amount to be determined on remand. Finally, the court held that we are entitled to Hayseeds damages for wrongful denial of the claim but remanded for a new trial on the amount of such damages after affirming that the original million award was excessive. On August 3, 2023, the Defendants-Appellees filed a Petition of Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the Fourth Circuit. The petition was denied by order dated August 15, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the court clarified that the amount of attorney s fees to be determined on remand included appellate fees. On September 8, 2023, the court entered its amended judgment, which awarded post-judgment interest on the previously awarded and reinstated verdict related to contract (compensatory) damages and the Fourth Circuit thereafter issued its mandate on October 2, 2023. The matter is now pending before the District Court for a new trial for Hayseeds damages, as well as the court s determination and award of attorney s fees. On August 19, 2024, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order that the Hayseeds damages to be considered in the new trial would include annoyance and inconvenience up to October 2, 2023 with new discovery permitted for the time period of July 15, 2021 through October 2, 2023. The Court also ordered Hayseeds damages to be considered for net economic loss caused by the defendant s delay in settlement be allowed for the time period of July 15, 2021 through October 2, 2023 with new discovery to be permitted for that time period. The defendants fully paid during 2023 the contract damages and interest portion of the judgment related to contract (compensatory) damages in the court s order and that portion of the matter is considered closed. On April 24, 2024, the Court stated Ramaco is entitled to reasonable attorney fees for both the appeal and the first trial, adding there will be a full Hayseeds trial under the timelines set forth above. Regarding the court s determination and award of attorney s fees, the Company accrued a loss recovery asset of approximately million during the second quarter of 2024. The Company considers that it is probable to recover at least this amount of previously recognized attorneys fees expenses based on the developments above. and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and pricing can be either fixed or derived against index-based pricing mechanisms. Sales completed with delivery to an export terminal are reported as export revenue. Disaggregated information about Revenue is presented below: Export revenue, excluding Canada Total revenue

 million net decrease to revenue and a million net increase to revenue, respectively, related to adjustments for performance obligations satisfied in a previous reporting period. These adjustments were due to true-ups of previous estimates for provisional pricing and demurrage as well as price adjustments for minimum specifications or qualities of delivered coal. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding performance obligations of approximately million tons for contracts with fixed sales prices averaging per ton, excluding freight, as well as million tons for contracts with index-based pricing mechanisms. The Company expects to satisfy approximately of the committed tons in the fourth quarter of 2024, in 2025, and in 2026. Variable amounts, including index-based prices, have not been estimated for the purpose of disclosing remaining performance obligations as permitted under the revenue recognition guidance when variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.

 , dividends declared by the Company were in excess of consolidated net income (loss) for the period, which resulted in an undistributed net loss for reporting purposes. The resulting undistributed net loss was allocated proportionately between outstanding Class A and Class B common stock based on the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation being equal between holders of Class A and Class B common stock. For the nine months ended , three dividends were declared for Class B common stock while only two dividends were declared for Class A common stock due to the timing of declaration. Diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units. For performance stock units, the awards are first evaluated under the contingently issuable shares guidance, which requires a determination as to whether shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. For shares determined to be issuable under performance stock unit awards, the treasury stock method is then applied to determine the dilutive impact of the awards, if any. Unvested restricted stock awards are considered potential common shares as well as participating securities, as discussed previously, and are included in diluted EPS using the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method. Since these awards share in dividends on a :1 basis with common shares, applying the treasury stock method is antidilutive compared to the basic EPS calculation that allocates earnings to participating securities under the two-class method discussed previously. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, diluted EPS for Class A Common stock excluded all outstanding awards of potential common stock because of the allocated net loss discussed above, and, therefore, the inclusion of any potential common shares would be antidilutive. Excluded Class A common stock awards were thousand options to purchase Class A common stock, thousand RSUs, and thousand PSUs (at target). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, diluted EPS for Class A common stock excluded only the RSUs and PSUs granted in the first quarter of 2024, as discussed in Note 6, because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method or, in the third quarter, because of the evaluation of such PSUs under the guidance for contingently issuable shares. potential common shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for Class B common stock. For the third quarter of 2023 and the period from June 21,2023 through September 30, 2023, diluted EPS for Class A common stock excluded thousand RSUs because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. Class A diluted EPS for these periods also excluded outstanding PSUs originally granted in 2022, or approximately thousand units if September 30, 2023 were the end of the contingency period, because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. The same PSUs, or thousand units at target, were excluded in the second quarter of 2023 based on the guidance for contingently issuable shares. For the third quarter of 2023 and the period from June 21, 2023 through September 30, 2023, diluted EPS for Class B common stock excluded certain PSUs, or approximately thousand units if September 30, 2023 were the end of the contingency period, because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. The same awards, or thousand units at target, were excluded in the second quarter of 2023 based on the guidance for contingently issuable shares. Diluted EPS for the single class of common stock existing from January 1, 2023 through June 20, 2023, excluded all outstanding RSUs, or thousand units in total, because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report, as well as the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. We caution you that our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, particularly in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and in our Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law. Overview We are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. Our development portfolio primarily includes the following properties: Elk Creek, Berwind, Knox Creek, and Maben. We believe each of these properties possesses geologic and logistical advantages that make our coal among the lowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our domestic customer base, North American blast furnace steel mills and coke plants, as well as international metallurgical coal consumers. We also control mineral deposits near Sheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company s initiatives regarding the potential recovery of rare earth elements and critical minerals as well as the potential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and materials. Our primary source of revenue is the sale of metallurgical coal. We are a pure-play metallurgical coal company with 59 million reserve tons and 1,119 million measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal. Our plan is to continue development of our existing properties and grow annual production over the next few years to approximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal, subject to market conditions, permitting and additional capital deployment in the medium-term. We may make acquisitions of reserves or infrastructure that continue our focus on advantaged geology and lower costs. The overall outlook of the metallurgical coal business is dependent on a variety of factors such as pricing, regulatory uncertainties, and global economic conditions. Coal consumption and production in the U.S. is driven by several market dynamics and trends including the U.S. and global economies, the U.S. dollar s strength relative to other currencies and accelerating production cuts. In addition, blast furnace steelmaking is more prevalent outside the U.S. compared to domestic steel production, which creates demand for exports of metallurgical coal. Global metallurgical coal markets have softened in 2024 due to constrained economic growth in some regions of the world and continued conflict overseas. The global steel market has experienced slower growth, especially in China, resulting in elevated levels of Chinese steel exports. These conditions have led steel companies to both cut back on their own production and to reduce the price they are willing to pay for their metallurgical coal feedstock. Longer term, the Company believes that limited global investment in new coking coal production capacity and an eventual return to economic growth will support coking coal markets overall. During the first nine months of 2024, we sold 2.9 million tons of coal and recognized 495.4 million of revenue. Of this amount, 33 of our revenue was from sales into North American markets, including Canada, and 67 of our revenue was from sales into export markets. During the same period of 2023, we sold 2.5 million tons of coal and recognized 490.8 million of revenue, of which 34 was from sales into North American markets, including Canada, and 66 was from sales into export markets. Sales into export markets, which often include index-based pricing, generally have greater exposure to variability in pricing from period to period. The Company s exports have not been materially delayed or otherwise affected by recent severe weather events or by dockworker labor disputes taking place at U.S. East Coast ports.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding performance obligations of approximately 1.7 million tons for contracts with fixed sales prices averaging 151 per ton, excluding freight, as well as 1.6 million tons for contracts with index-based pricing mechanisms. The Company expects to satisfy approximately 36 of these commitments in the fourth quarter of 2024, 63 of these commitments in 2025, and the remaining 1 in 2026. Subsequent to the date of the financial statements, the Company obtained additional sales commitments of approximately 0.7 million tons. The Company continues to assess its potential rare earth and critical minerals deposit in Wyoming and is making progress in terms of initial mine development and related chemical, metallurgical, and mineralogy testing. Analysis performed to date indicates elevated levels of rare earth elements along with significant concentrations of critical minerals Gallium and Germanium. The Company expects to complete its techno-economic analysis of the overall commercial aspects of the opportunity later this year and anticipates beginning construction of a demonstration processing facility in mid to late 2025. Our rare earth elements exploration target is currently in an exploration stage and does not represent, and should not be construed to be, a mineral resource or mineral reserve as such terms are used in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. The Company also continues its work to advance new carbon product technologies with the goal of commercializing products that use coal in both an improved economic and environmental manner.

 Coal sales information is summarized as follows: 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Revenue 167,411 186,966 (19,555) 495,403 490,795 4,608 Tons sold 1,023 996 27 2,867 2,467 400 Total revenue per ton sold (GAAP basis) 164 188 (24) 173 199 (26) Cost of sales 134,731 144,635 (9,904) 397,214 354,383 42,831 Tons sold 1,023 996 27 2,867 2,467 400 Total cost of sales per ton sold (GAAP basis) 132 145 (13) 139 144 (5) Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for supplemental calculations of revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) and cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) Our revenue includes sales of Company produced coal and coal purchased from third parties. We include amounts billed by us for transportation to our customers within revenue and transportation costs incurred within cost of sales. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue. Coal sales revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 167.4 million, approximately 10 lower than the same period in 2023 driven by the negative impact of pricing offset partially by the 3 increase in tons sold. The increase in tons sold occurred in export markets, which increased 13 but were offset partially by the decrease in North America volumes. Revenue per ton sold decreased 13 from 188 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 164 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was driven by the variability in index-based pricing for export sales. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation revenues and demurrage, also decreased 13 from 157 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 136 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. The decrease in the Company s revenue per ton sold measures was due to the decrease in metallurgical coal prices as U.S. metallurgical coal indices continued to fall in the third quarter of 2024 by an average of 7 due to the macroeconomic conditions discussed earlier. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain volatile in the near term. There are no revenues from rare earth and critical minerals at this time. Cost of sales. Our cost of coal sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 134.7 million, approximately 7 lower than the same period in 2023 despite the 3 increase in tons sold discussed above. Cost of sales per ton sold decreased 9 from 145 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 132 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) , a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation costs, alternative mineral development costs, and idle mine costs, decreased 10 from 113 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 102 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. Mine costs for the third quarter of 2024 benefited from efficiencies gained from increased production versus the same period in 2023. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled 17.8 million and 14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase year-to-year was related to 1.3 million of additional amortization for the Knox Creek Jawbone mine, which is due to the closure of the mine, as well as the general increases in plant and equipment and production versus 2023.

 Selling, general, and administrative. Selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses were 12.9 million and 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The 1.5 million increase in 2024 was primarily due to the increase in stock-based compensation expense. Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net was 0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income, net in the third quarter of 2023 was due primarily to recognition of the 7.8 million legal verdict for contract (compensatory) damages related to the 2018 Elk Creek silo failure as well as the receipt of 3.0 million of insurance proceeds related to the methane ignition that occurred at our Berwind complex in 2022. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net was 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in 2024 was largely due to the repayment in full of related-party debt in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with the financing of the acquisition of Ramaco Coal from Yorktown Partners. Interest expense related to this financing was 0.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense (benefit). The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 9 and 22 , respectively, excluding the impact of discrete items. The primary differences from the federal statutory rate of 21 are related to state taxes, non-deductible expenses, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and depletion expense for income tax purposes. Earnings (loss) per share. Refer to Note 10 of Part I, Item 1 for information regarding earnings per share calculations for Class A and Class B common stock. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue. Coal sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 495.4 million, approximately 1 higher than the same period in 2023 due to the increase in tons sold, which was mostly offset by the negative impact of pricing. The 16 increase in tons sold occurred in both North America and export markets, with export volumes increasing by 20 and North America volumes increasing by 10 , and was aided by the Company s increased capacity for production achieved during late 2023. Revenue per ton sold decreased 13 from 199 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 173 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was driven by the variability in index-based pricing for export sales. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation revenues and demurrage, decreased 14 from 169 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 145 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. U.S. metallurgical coal price indices have fallen by roughly 32 on a year-to-date basis driven by the macroeconomic conditions discussed previously. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain volatile in the near term. There are no revenues from rare earth and critical minerals at this time. Cost of sales. Our cost of coal sales totaled 397.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 354.4 million for the same period in 2023. The 12 increase was driven by the increase in tons sold, as discussed directly above. Cost of sales per ton sold decreased 3 from 144 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 139 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) , a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation costs, alternative mineral development costs, and idle mine costs, decreased 2 from 111 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 109 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. Mine costs for 2024 were impacted negatively by challenging geology and labor constraints in the first quarter of 2024 but improved during the second and third quarters of 2024 due to efficiencies gained from increased production compared to the same periods in 2023. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled 48.9 million and 39.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase

 year-to-year was related to 1.2 million of additional amortization for the Knox Creek Jawbone mine, which is due to the closure of the mine, as well as the general increases in plant and equipment and production versus 2023. Selling, general, and administrative. SG A expenses were 37.9 million and 37.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. SG A expenses in 2024 include a 3.1 million benefit accrued for the probable recovery of attorney fees related to the silo failure litigation developments, which is not indicative of future SG A expenses. This matter offset most of the 2024 increase in stock-based compensation. Other income (expense), net. Other income, net was 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily related to the 2.2 million recovery of previously incurred demurrage and other transportation-related matters. Other income, net was 15.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was due primarily to recognition of the 7.8 million legal verdict for contract (compensatory) damages related to the 2018 Elk Creek silo failure as well as the 4.9 million gain from the Company s insurance claim related to the methane ignition that occurred at our Berwind complex in 2022. The Company received 6.0 million of proceeds during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the Berwind ignition and had previously accrued a 1.1 million loss recovery asset at year-end 2022. These activities are not indicative of future results. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net was 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in 2024 was largely due to the repayment in full of related-party debt in 2023 associated with the financing of the acquisition of Ramaco Coal from Yorktown Partners. Interest expense related to this financing totaled 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 28 and 21 , respectively, excluding the 1.0 million favorable impact of discrete items in 2024. The primary differences from the federal statutory rate of 21 are related to state taxes, non-deductible expenses, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and depletion expense for income tax purposes. Earnings per share. Refer to Note 10 of Part I, Item 1 for information regarding earnings per share calculations for Class A and Class B common stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources The metallurgical coal markets are volatile in nature; therefore, the Company prioritizes managing its financial position and liquidity, while managing costs and capital expenditures and returning value to its shareholders. On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment Agreement to the Second Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement in order to, among other things, extend the maturity date and increase the size of its existing Revolving Credit Facility. The amended facility has a maturity date of May 3, 2029, and provides an initial aggregate revolving commitment of 200 million as well as an accordion feature to increase the size by an additional 75 million subject to certain terms and conditions, including the lenders consent. The amended facility provides the Company with additional flexibility to pursue further growth in production while meeting normal operating requirements. The terms of the amended facility also require the Company to maintain certain covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratio and compensating balance requirements. Borrowings under the amended facility may not exceed the borrowing base as determined under the amended formula included in the agreement. At September 30, 2024, we had 22.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and 57.9 million of remaining availability under our Revolving Credit Facility for future borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents include 7.5 million of compensating balances held in dedicated accounts to assure future credit availability under the revolver. The Company s total current assets were 146.7 million and were in excess of total current liabilities by 37.9 million as of the balance sheet date.

 Significant sources and uses of cash during the first nine months of 2024 Sources of cash: Cash flows provided by operating activities were 97.0 million during the first nine months of 2024, which were driven primarily by net earnings adjusted for non-cash expenses including depreciation, depletion, and amortization as well as stock-based compensation. Changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to operating cash flow driven primarily by the decrease in accounts receivable due to the collection of fourth quarter 2023 revenues, which were 35.3 million higher than third quarter 2024 revenues. Uses of cash: Capital expenditures totaled 57.9 million, including expenditures related to the preparation plant and expansion of our Maben complex. Capital expenditures for the Maben preparation plant totaled 12.3 million, including approximately 3 million for the initial purchase of the plant. The preparation plant at Maben was commissioned in October 2024, which should reduce trucking costs at the complex going forward. The Company anticipates lower capital spending in the fourth quarter of 2024 as most of the Company s annual growth capital expenditures occurred in the first half of 2024. Cash outflows for financing activities totaled 58.0 million, which included: o net repayments of 24.2 million on our existing debt, finance leases, and insurance financing and o net outflow of 33.8 million to stockholders driven by dividend payments of 24.5 million, which include 18.2 million for Class A common stock and 6.2 million for Class B common stock. The Class B common stock dividends were calculated based on 20 of the previous quarter s CORE royalty and infrastructure fees as shown below. Refer to Note 6 of Part I, Item 1 for additional information regarding dividends.

 Future sources and uses of cash Our primary use of cash includes capital expenditures for mine development and ongoing operating expenses. We expect to fund our capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months and the reasonably foreseeable future with cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, projected cash flows from operations, and, if warranted, capital raised under the Company s shelf registration discussed below. Factors that could adversely impact our future liquidity and ability to carry out our capital expenditure program include the following: Timely delivery of our product by rail and other transportation carriers; Late payments of accounts receivable by our customers; Cost overruns in our purchases of equipment needed to complete our mine development plans; Delays in completion of development of our various mines, processing plants and refuse disposal facilities, which would reduce the coal we would have available to sell and our cash flow from operations; and Adverse changes in the metallurgical coal markets that would reduce the expected cash flow from operations. If future cash flows were to become insufficient to meet our liquidity needs or capital requirements, due to changes in macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, we may reduce our expected level of capital expenditures for new mine production and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures through the issuance of debt or equity securities, new debt arrangements, or from other sources such as asset sales. On September 1, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement to sell any combination of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, and rights at an aggregate initial offering price of up to 400.0 million. No securities may be sold until a prospectus supplement describing the method and terms of any future offering is delivered. Refer to Note 4 of Part I, Item 1 for information regarding the Company s Revolving Credit Facility and indebtedness. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses reported for the period then ended. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of the Annual Report. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements A discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements is included under the heading Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements in the Annual Report. There were no material changes during the first nine months of 2024. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense; stock-based compensation expense; depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses; income taxes; accretion of asset retirement obligations; and, when applicable, certain other non-operating items (income tax penalties and charitable contributions). A reconciliation of net

 income to Adjusted EBITDA is included below. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as a substitute to U.S. GAAP measures of performance and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.

We believe revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) provides useful information to investors as it enables investors to compare revenue per ton we generate against similar measures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal prices from period to period excluding the impact of transportation costs which are beyond our control. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute to revenue under U.S. GAAP.

We believe cash cost per ton sold provides useful information to investors as it enables investors to compare our cash cost per ton against similar measures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal cost from period to period excluding the impact of transportation costs which are beyond our control, and alternative mineral costs, which are more developmentally focused at the present time. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute to cost of sales under U.S. GAAP.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosures about market risk are included in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of our Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer, who serves as our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who serves as our principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. However, based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report as a result of the two material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described below. Previously Reported Material Weakness We previously identified a material weakness and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, management identified a material weakness related to a pervasive lack of sufficient documentation of accounting policies, procedures, and controls. This lack of sufficient documentation does not allow management to effectively assess its relevant risks and key controls to properly test for design and operating effectiveness. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Table of Contents 
 Remediation Plan We have developed a plan of remediation to address this material weakness, which will include assessing, redesigning, and implementing modifications to our internal controls. We will not be able to fully remediate this material weakness until these steps have been completed and subsequent validation and testing of these internal controls have demonstrated their operating effectiveness over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. Once the remediation plan is fully developed, we will be implementing process, control, and documentation improvements to address the above material weakness that include, but are not limited to, designing and implementing specific management review procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of key financial and non-financial data utilized in our business; and implementing improved policies, procedures, and control activities over key financial data to ensure accuracy and completeness of this data as used in the aforementioned management review procedures. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We are actively improving our control environment by executing our remediation plan to address the material weakness, as described above. Our remediation process has resulted in changes to our control environment that we believe represent changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, during the most recent fiscal period, management determined that a material weakness existed related to inappropriate segregation of duties related to certain individuals having both system administrator responsibilities within the Company s Enterprise Resource Planning ERP financial system and responsibilities for certain accounting and financial reporting functions. The inappropriate segregation of duties was not appropriately mitigated by the monitoring controls implemented to ensure individuals with system administrator access did not make unauthorized changes to the Company s information systems impacting the financial reporting of the Company. We have implemented an enhanced monitoring control as of the end of the third quarter of 2024, which we believe is designed effectively to remediate the aforementioned material weakness; however, additional testing will be required in the fourth quarter to ensure that the enhanced control activities are operating as designed before we can conclude the material weakness has been remediated. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures Senior members of management do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Exhibit 95.1 Federal Mine Safety and Health Act Information We work to prevent accidents and occupational illnesses. We have in place health and safety programs that include extensive employee training, safety incentives, drug and alcohol testing and safety audits. The objectives of our health and safety programs are to provide a safe work environment, provide employees with proper training and equipment and implement safety and health rules, policies and programs that foster safety excellence. Our mining operations are subject to extensive and stringent compliance standards established pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA monitors and rigorously enforces compliance with these standards, and our mining operations are inspected frequently. Citations and orders are issued by MSHA under Section 104 of the Mine Act for violations of the Mine Act or any mandatory health or safety standard, rule, order or regulation promulgated under the Mine Act. Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K require issuers to include in periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission certain information relating to citations or orders for violations of standards under the Mine Act. We present information below regarding certain mining safety and health violations, orders and citations, issued by MSHA and related assessments and legal actions and mine-related fatalities with respect to our coal mining operations. In evaluating this information, consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of violations, orders and citations will vary depending on the size of the coal mine, (ii) the number of violations, orders and citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) violations, orders and citations can be contested and appealed, and in that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The following tables include information required by the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K for the current quarter. The mine data retrieval system maintained by MSHA may show information that is different than what is provided herein. Any such difference may be attributed to the need to update that information on MSHA s system and/or other factors. The tables below do not include any orders or citations issued to independent contractors at our mines.

 (1) Mine Act Section 104(a) significant and substantial S S citations shown above are for alleged violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to a coal mine health and safety hazard. It should be noted that, for purposes of this table, S S citations that are included in another column, such as Section 104(d) citations, are not also included as Section 104(a) S S citations in this column. (2) Mine Act Section 104(b) orders are for alleged failures to totally abate a citation within the time period specified in the citation. 

 (3) Mine Act Section 104(d) citations and orders are for an alleged unwarrantable failure (i.e., aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence) to comply with mandatory health or safety standards. (4) Mine Act Section 110(b)(2) violations are for an alleged flagrant failure (i.e., reckless or repeated) to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory safety or health standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury. (5) Mine Act Section 107(a) orders are for alleged conditions or practices which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated and result in orders of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition. (6) Amounts shown include assessments proposed by MSHA on all citations and orders, including those citations and orders that are not required to be included within the above chart. Note: Due to an interruption in the mail provider service for MSHA s Office of Assessments, we received no proposed assessments from MSHA during the third quarter of 2024. We expect to receive any assessments that would have been proposed during the third quarter in the fourth quarter of 2024 or beyond. (7) Mine Act Section 104(e) written notices are for an alleged pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to a coal mine safety or health hazard.
