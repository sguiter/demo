reporting units defined as Aperture Solutions U.S., Aperture Solutions Canada, Surface Solutions U.S., Surface Solutions Canada, Stone and Shelter Solutions. Aperture Solutions U.S. and Aperture Solutions Canada reporting units are part of the Aperture Solutions reportable segment. Surface Solutions U.S., Surface Solutions Canada and Stone are part of the Surface Solutions reportable segment. Shelter Solutions is a reporting unit and a reportable segment. 
 During August 2024, we evaluated goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level, due to the events described below, which indicated the carrying amounts of goodwill within the Aperture Solutions and Surface Solutions reportable segments and intangible assets in the Surface Solutions reportable segment were in excess of their estimated fair values. 
 Aperture Solutions U.S., Siding Solutions U.S. and Stone experienced adverse impacts as a result of changes in market conditions and continued high-interest rates, relative to recent historical values, which contributed to reduced forecasted revenues and reduced projected future cash flows. 
 As a result of these adverse impacts, the Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of these reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. When performing the assessment the Company determined the fair value of its reporting units as described below. The Company determined that the carrying amount of goodwill for its Aperture Solutions U.S., Siding Solutions U.S., and Stone reporting units were impaired during the three months ended September 28, 2024. As a result the Company recorded the following impairment charges: million related to Aperture Solutions U.S., million related to Siding Solutions U.S. and million related to Stone. After recording these impairment charges, there is goodwill remaining at Stone. goodwill impairment charges were recorded prior to or during 2023. 
 If these or our other reporting units are unable to achieve their current financial forecasts, we may be required to record an impairment charge in a future period related to goodwill. 
 The Company uses a quantitative approach to measure the fair value of its reporting units by equally weighting the discounted cash flow approach, which is a Level 3 measurement, and the market approach, which is a Level 2 measurement. The market approach estimates fair value through recent sales of comparable assets or business entities. The discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgements, including estimates of future cash flows, which are dependent on internal forecasts and determination of the Company s weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital used for all reporting units in the Company s analysis was .

 During August 2024, the Company recorded an impairment charge to the intangible assets within the Stone reporting unit. The Company s forecasted cash flows of Stone indicated the carrying value of the intangible assets were not recoverable and therefore the Company recorded an impairment charge of million during the three months ended September 28, 2024. After recording this impairment charge, no intangible assets remain at Stone. impairments were recorded prior to or during 2023.

The change in the effective tax rate for the three and nine month periods ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to pre-tax book losses resulting from impairment charges to deductible and non-deductible goodwill and intangible assets in addition to increased book amortization and depreciation related to the Merger transaction.

 Litigation 
 The Company is a party to a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. The Company is also included in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines or penalties and other costs in substantial amounts and are described below. 
 Stockholder Litigation 
 In July 2022, and pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 5, 2022, Clayton, Dubilier and Rice, LLC CD R became the indirect owner of Cornerstone Building Brands. In January 2023, purported former stockholders filed separate complaints challenging the fairness of the Merger. The complaints are captioned Firefighters Pension System of the City of Kansas City, Missouri Trust and Gary D. Voigt v. Affeldt et al., C.A. No. 2023-0091-JTL (Del. Ch.) and Whitebark Value Partners LP and Robert Garfield v. Clayton Dubilier Rice, LLC et al., C.A. No. 2023-0092-JTL (Del. Ch.). In both complaints, the plaintiffs allege that CD R and its affiliates controlled the Company prior to the transaction and that certain directors and officers of the Company, as well as CD R and its affiliates, breached their fiduciary duties and engaged in conduct resulting in a sale of the Cornerstone Building Brands public stockholders shares to CD R at an unfair price. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, attorneys fees, expenses and costs. The court consolidated the cases, and on May 3, 2023, selected Whitebark Value Partners LP as lead plaintiff. On July 14, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the operative complaint. The motion to dismiss was denied on January 10, 2024, and the case is ongoing. On June 26, 2024, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims. The Company cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of these matters or determine the extent of any potential liabilities. The Company also cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss.

 Depreciation and amortization increased 10.3 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and decreased 34.6 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 mainly due to the acquisitions of Harvey and Mueller during the current year offset by the Company recording a cumulative catch-up adjustment during the prior year which resulted in increases of 65.2 million and 1.3 million to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses to account for the update in fair value of these assets as if the adjustments had been made as of the date of the Merger, as well as shortened useful lives and a higher depreciable base as a result of the Merger. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our main liquidity and capital resource needs are payments to service our debt, ongoing operations and working capital requirements, capital expenditures and the cost of acquisitions. Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from our continuing operations, as well as borrowings under our credit facilities. We believe that funds provided by these sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital resource needs for at least the next 12 months under current operating conditions. 
 We may from time to time take steps to reduce our debt. These actions may include repurchases or opportunistic refinancing of debt. The amount of debt, if any, that may be repurchased or refinanced will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. Our affiliates may also purchase our debt from time to time, through open market purchases or other transactions. In such cases, our debt may not be retired, in which case we would continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of such debt and we would continue to reflect the debt as outstanding in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 (1,080,565) (203,614) Cash flows from financing activities

 Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
 Net cash from operating activities consists mainly of: (i) cash collections on credit sales to our customers, (ii) purchases of commodity based raw materials, (iii) labor and other employee-related expenditures, (iv) other non-labor costs, such as, among other items, supplies, insurance, advertising and marketing costs, (v) interest paid on our long-term debt and (vi) payments for income taxes. 
 Net cash from operating activities was (177.6) million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, a decrease from the 181.6 million provided by operations in the prior year. Lower volumes, higher core working capital, consisting of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payables, were offset by the timing of incentive compensation plan payouts and the impact of the acquisitions. 
 Cash Flows From Investing Activities 
 Our main uses of cash for investing activities are for payments for property and equipment and acquisitions of businesses. 
 Net cash from investing activities was (1,080.6) million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to (203.6) million used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 877.0 million decrease is mainly driven by higher capital expenditures and the acquisitions of Harvey and Mueller in 2024.

Cash Flows From Financing Activities 
 Our main uses of cash for financing activities include activity to repurchase and make payments on our long-term debt and distributions to our direct parent Camelot Return Intermediate Holdings, LLC, Camelot Parent ). Our main sources of cash from financing activities include the proceeds from issuances of debt. 
 Net cash from financing activities was 946.5 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to (55.6) million used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1,002.2 million is mainly driven by 1,200.0 million in additional short-term borrowings and 500.0 million in long-term borrowings through amendments to our ABL Credit Agreement and term loan facility and the issuance of the 9.500 Senior Secured Notes during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The increase is partially offset by the dividend payment of 231.6 million made to Camelot Parent and 995.0 million in repayments of short-term borrowings. 
 
 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments 
 Leases 
 We have leases for certain manufacturing, warehouse, distribution locations, offices, vehicles and equipment. As of September 28, 2024 the Company had total future lease payments of 743.2 million, with 81.7 million payable within 12 months. 
 Debt 
 We have certain debt instruments outstanding. As of September 28, 2024 the Company had total future payments of 5.0 billion, with 239.0 million payable within 12 months. See Note 7 Debt in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use several measures derived from consolidated financial information, but not presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S U.S. GAAP ). These measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, in this report, we refer to adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Our non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to replace the presentation of the comparable measure under U.S. GAAP. However, we believe the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, along with a reconciliation to its respective U.S. GAAP financial measure, assists investors in understanding the factors and trends affecting our underlying business that could not be obtained absent these disclosures. Additionally, we believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measure enables investors to evaluate trends in the business excluding certain items which are not entirely a result of our base operations. 
 Furthermore, the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure supplements other metrics we use to internally evaluate our business and facilitates the comparison of past and present operations. The non-GAAP financial measure we use may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and other companies may not define non-GAAP financial measures we use in the same way.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. Refer to the 2023 Form 10-K for a description of the Company s critical accounting estimates. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. Refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a description of the Company s market risks. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the period ended September 28, 2024 and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 28, 2024 due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. 
 32 

Table of Contents 

Notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded that the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of an issuer s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that an issuer s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of an issuer s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, the application of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. Management s assessment was based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) COSO ). Based on management s assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 28, 2024 due to the material weakness described below. 
 
 Material Weakness 
 
 A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 On April 1, 2024, we implemented an enterprise resource planning ERP system in our Shelter Solutions reportable segment. During the quarterly period ended September 28, 2024, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that arose from the ineffective application of the software development life cycle SDLC information technology general control. Specifically, the Company determined that the assigned team members lacked the requisite knowledge and experience to develop functional requirements, configure the system, and complete user acceptance tests sufficient to fully test the ERP system prior to going live. 
 
 Management s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness 
 
 Management has evaluated the deficiency described above and is developing a remediation plan designed to strengthen our SDLC processes. The remediation plan requires that: (i) functional business experts are identified, trained, and meet established requirements, (ii) business users have sufficient understanding of the underlying functionality being tested, and (iii) additional levels of review are established throughout the SDLC. The remediation plan is subject to ongoing management review, as well as oversight by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 
 As our remediation efforts are still on-going, we will continue to consider the need for additional resources or to implement further enhancements to our policies and procedures as necessary to further improve our internal control over financial reporting. As we work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may modify our remediation plan and may implement measures as we continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures in the ordinary course. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls have been operating for a sufficient period of time and can be evidenced through testing that these are operating effectively.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except for the material weakness identified by management and described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended September 28, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our CEO and CFO, intends that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceeding. 
 See Part I, Item 1, Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies , which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). The risks disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K, and information provided elsewhere in this report, could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are including the following supplemental risk factor, which should be read in conjunction with our description of risk factors disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and, if our remediation of this material weakness is not effective, or if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our results of operations. 
 
 As discussed in Item 4, Controls and Procedures , in the course of preparing our financial statements for the interim period ended September 28, 2024, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that existed due to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning ERP system within the Shelter Solutions reportable segment. The presence of this material weakness creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. However, no such material misstatement has occurred to date. 
 We are taking steps to address these control issues. The remediation steps will require that, among other items: (i) functional business experts are identified, trained, and meet established requirements, (ii) business users have sufficient understanding of the underlying functionality being tested, and (iii) additional levels of review are established throughout the development cycle. 
 
 34 

Table of Contents 

While we believe that these efforts will remediate the material weakness identified, the implementation of these measures is ongoing and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. 
 
 We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and that we are continuing to implement, will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness we have identified or that we will not uncover additional material weaknesses in the future. If the steps we take do not remediate the material weakness in a timely manner, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that these control deficiencies or others could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
