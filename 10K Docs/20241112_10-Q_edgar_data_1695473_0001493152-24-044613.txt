Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 

This
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, 
 estimate, may, should, could, will, plan, future, 
 continue, and other expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and that do not relate to
historical matters identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations or forecasts
of future events, can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, and are subject to various business risks and known and unknown uncertainties,
a number of which are beyond our control. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained
in this document, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation
to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A wide
variety of factors could cause or contribute to such differences and could adversely impact revenues, profitability, cash flows and capital
needs. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this document will, in fact, transpire or prove to
be accurate. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the
risks in the section entitled Risk Factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed
or implied by any forward-looking statements. 

Important
factors that may cause the actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements, projections or other expectations include, but
are not limited to, the following: 

risk
 that we will not be able to remediate identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure
 controls and procedures; 

risk
 that we fail to meet the requirements of the agreements under which we acquired our business interests, including any cash payments
 to the business operations, which could result in the loss of our right to continue to operate or develop the specific businesses
 described in the agreements; 

risk
 that we will be unable to secure additional financing in the near future in order to commence and sustain our planned development
 and growth plans; 

risk
 that we cannot attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, particularly employees, consultants and contractors for our operations; 

risks
 and uncertainties relating to the various industries and operations we are currently engaged in; 

results
 of initial feasibility, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, and the possibility that future growth, development or expansion
 will not be consistent with our expectations; 

risks
 related to the inherent uncertainty of business operations including profit, cost of goods, production costs and cost estimates and
 the potential for unexpected costs and expenses; 

risks
 related to commodity price fluctuations; 

the
 uncertainty of profitability based upon our history of losses; 

risks
 related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms for our planned development projects; 

risks
 related to environmental regulation and liability; 

risks
 related to tax assessments; 

other
 risks and uncertainties related to our prospects, properties and business strategy. 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as
of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements
to conform these statements to actual results, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

C in exchange for newly issued shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Exchange ).
 shares of common stock and is entitled to vote 50 votes per
share on all matters as a class with holders of common stock. Since after the Exchange was consummated, the former shareholders of Green
C and their designees owned approximately of the issued and outstanding voting shares of the Company, Green C is the acquirer for
accounting purposes. Prior to the Exchange, the Company had no assets and nominal business operations. Accordingly, the Exchange has
been treated for accounting purposes as a recapitalization by the accounting acquirer, Green C, and the accompanying consolidated financial
statements of the Company reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of Green C from its inception on December 21, 2017 to July 31,
2018 and combined with the Company thereafter. 

Green
C was incorporated on December 21, 2017 under the laws of the Province of Ontario Canada with its principal place of business in North
York, Ontario. 

Green
C was the owner of an exclusive, worldwide license for an eluting transmucosal patch platform ETP for non-invasive drug
delivery in the cannabis field as further described in the exclusive license agreement dated June 21, 2018 with Pharmedica Ltd. (see
Note J). 

After
the consummation of the above-described transactions, the Company switched its business model in fiscal 2018 and no longer intended to
pursue E-commerce, advertising, licensing (except as specified below) or direct investment operations. Instead, the Company is now engaged
in the development and commercialization of innovative cannabinoid therapeutics. 

From
July 2018 through mid-2021, the Company focused on commercializing its own and licensed technologies worldwide for transmucosal and transdermal
delivery of legal medical or recreational cannabis (other than in the field of oral care) and cannabinoids. The Company s initial
product was an oral transmucosal patch platform which for provides for loaded actives to be absorbed by the buccal mucosa into the body.
Although the Company was able to launch the product and received some limited initial orders, the Company s management ultimately
elected to pursue other opportunities which they believed offered the Company greater potential for growth and ultimate profitability. 

Accordingly,
on October 19, 2021 the Company entered into a license agreement with Shaare Zedek Scientific Ltd. SZS ), the technology
transfer arm of Jerusalem s Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC). The license agreement covers the license of SZS s novel cannabinoid
therapeutic focused on treatment of autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease and other neuropsychiatric
disorders. 

Accompanying
the license agreement is a joint research and development agreement, which will focus on continuing the clinical program spearheaded
by Dr. Adi Aran, M.D. Director of Pediatric Neurology at SZMC, Board Member of the Israeli Society for Pediatric Neurology, and co-inventor
of the novel cannabinoid therapy.

, total current liabilities
of , and negative working capital of . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 
and used cash from operating activities. We expect to continue to incur negative cash flows until such time as our business
generates sufficient cash inflows to finance our operations and debt service requirements. 

In
performing the second step of this assessment, we are required to evaluate whether our plans to mitigate the conditions above alleviate
the substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. Our future plans include securing additional funding sources. 

There
is no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will
be available through external sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations
or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore,
have a material effect on the business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available
on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company s existing shareholders. We have therefore
concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through September 2025. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Company
Overview 

From
July 2018 through mid-2021, Greater Cannabis focused on commercializing its own and licensed technologies worldwide for transmucosal
and transdermal delivery of legal medical or recreational cannabis (other than in the field of oral care) and cannabinoids CBD (. While part of the cannabis family, CBD, which contains less than 0.3 tetrahydrocannabinol THC ), the psychoactive compound
that produces the high in marijuana, is distinguished from cannabis by its use, physical appearance and lower THC concentration
(cannabis generally has a THC level of 10 or more). The Company s initial product was an oral transmucosal patch platform which
for provides for loaded actives to be absorbed by the buccal mucosa into the body. Although the Company was able to launch the product
and received some limited initial orders, Greater Cannabis management ultimately elected to pursue other opportunities which they believed
offered the Company greater potential for growth and ultimate profitability. 

Accordingly,
on October 19, 2021 the Company entered into a license agreement with Shaare Zedek Scientific Ltd. SZS ), the technology
transfer arm of Jerusalem s Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC). The license agreement covers the license of SZS s novel cannabinoid
therapeutic focused on treatment of autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease and other neuropsychiatric
disorders. Shaare Zedek Medical Center, founded in 1901, is one of the largest multidisciplinary research hospitals in Israel with 1,000
beds and over 850,000 patient visits a year. The SZMC Center for Research and Development has over 300 annual publications of investigator
initiated studies in medical journals in addition to almost 160 clinical trials. 

Accompanying
the license agreement is a joint research and development agreement, which will focus on continuing the clinical program spearheaded
by Dr. Adi Aran, M.D. Director of Pediatric Neurology at SZMC, Board Member of the Israeli Society for Pediatric Neurology, and co-inventor
of the novel cannabinoid therapy. Dr. Aran is a world renowned expert in cannabis research and pediatric neurology and was the principal
investigator of the first ever cannabis research study conducted on autistic children. 

Dr.
Aran s pioneering study assessed safety, tolerability and efficacy of CBD based medical cannabis as an adjuvant therapy for refractory
behavioral problems in children with ASD. The results provided very compelling evidence that medical cannabis is an effective therapy
for children on the autism spectrum. Conditions in 80 of the children improved, with 62 of parents reporting substantial improvements.
Half of the children had improved communication and 40 reported a decrease in anxiety. The same children had not shown improvement with
conventional drug therapies. Dr. Aran and his team have now developed a novel combination therapy that is believed to be significantly
more effective than the cannabis-only formulation that had been used in the aforementioned study. The Company plans to further develop
this therapeutic and conduct clinical studies to further substantiate its safety and efficacy beginning in neuropsychiatric disorders. 

The
clinical studies of the therapeutic are expected to require an investment of up to 1,000,000 and up to two years to finalize. 

The
Company s current business plan is to (i) conduct clinical studies on and commercialize the cannabinoid-based therapeutic and (ii)
concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing
agreements or acquisitions.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
SEC issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies 
suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In Financial Reporting
Release No. 60, the SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s
financial condition and operating results and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following significant
policies as critical to the understanding of our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make a variety of estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and (ii) the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. Our management expects to
make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting
the future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe that
our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and
assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to investors.

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, Aitan Zacharin, the
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal executive, financial and accounting officer), and effected
by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 

The
Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
chief executive officer and acting chief financial officer (principal executive, financial and accounting officer, assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting at March 21, 2022, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on that assessment under those criteria, management has determined that, as of March 31, 2022, our internal controls over financial
reporting was not effective for the reasons set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

As
set forth in that Report the Company intends to take various remedial measures described therein as its capital resources permit.
