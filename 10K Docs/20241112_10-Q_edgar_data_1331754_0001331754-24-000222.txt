Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Presentation 
 
 This discussion and analysis by management of the Bank's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K and the interim Financial Statements and related Notes to Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements . 
 
 Unless otherwise stated, amounts disclosed in this Item are rounded to the nearest million; therefore, dollar amounts of less than one million may not be reflected or, due to rounding, may not appear to agree to the amounts presented in thousands in the Financial Statements and related Notes to Financial Statements . Amounts used to calculate dollar and percentage changes are based on numbers in the thousands. Accordingly, calculations based upon the disclosed amounts (millions) may not produce the same results. 

Executive Summary 
 
 Overview. As an FHLBank , we are a regional wholesale bank that serves as a financial intermediary between the capital markets and our members. The Bank is structured as a financial cooperative, which allows our business to be scalable and self-capitalizing without taking undue risks, diminishing capital adequacy or jeopardizing profitability. Therefore, the Bank is generally designed to expand and contract in asset size as the needs of our members and their communities change. 
 
 We primarily make secured loans in the form of advances to our members and purchase whole mortgage loans from our members. Additionally, we purchase other investments and provide other financial services to our members. 
 
 Our principal source of funding is the proceeds from the sale to the public of FHLBank debt instruments, called consolidated obligations, which are the joint and several obligation of all FHLBanks. We obtain additional funds from deposits, other borrowings, and by issuing capital stock to our members. 
 
 Our primary source of revenue is interest earned on advances, mortgage loans, and investments, including MBS. 
 
 Our net interest income is primarily determined by the size of our balance sheet and the spread between the interest rate earned on our assets and the interest rate paid on our share of the consolidated obligations. A substantial portion of net interest income may also be derived from deploying our capital which has no associated interest cost, i.e., interest-free capital. We use funding and hedging strategies to manage the related interest-rate risk. 
 
 Due to our cooperative ownership structure and wholesale nature, we typically earn a narrow interest spread. Accordingly, our net income is relatively low compared to our total assets and capital. 
 
 In addition, as a cooperative, some members utilize our products more heavily and own more capital stock than others. As a result, we must achieve a balance in generating membership value from rates we charge on advances or prices we pay to purchase mortgage loans and paying a competitive dividend rate. 
 
 We group our products and services within two operating segments: traditional and mortgage loans .

Business Environment. The Bank s financial performance is influenced by several key national economic and market factors, including fiscal and monetary policies, the conditions in the housing markets and the level and volatility of market interest rates. 
 
 Economy and Financial Markets. The U.S. economy grew at a slightly slower pace than expected in the third quarter of 2024 as U.S. real gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, grew at a seasonally- and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.8 , a slight pullback from the rate of 3.0 in the second quarter and lower than the 3.1 economists had predicted. However, consumer spending remained strong, despite high borrowing costs, as rising wages, pandemic savings and a solid but cooling labor market helped consumers continue to spend. The labor market has remained tight and the unemployment rate of 4.1 continues to be low by historical measures, according to the U.S. Labor Department. 
 
 U.S. inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index published by the U.S. Labor Department, eased to a new three-year low in September but is cooling slower than expected . The personal-consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose at an annual rate of 2.1 , according to the Commerce Department. The associated measure of core prices, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.7 compared to a year earlier, underscoring that inflation remains persistent and continues to follow an uneven path downward. 
 
 The resilient consumer continues to spark hopes that the economy will experience a soft landing, where inflation ebbs without causing a recession. 
 
 Conditions in U.S. Housing Markets. The actions by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation by raising interest rates have most directly affected consumers through the housing market. In 2023, home sales dropped to the lowest level in nearly three decades as elevated mortgage interest rates kept many buyers out of the market due to a lack of affordability, which reduced housing demand. At the same time, high mortgage rates discouraged homeowners from selling as many were reluctant to give up their existing low mortgage rates, reducing the available inventory of homes for sale. 
 
 The result of lower demand and lower supply was declining existing-home sales and stubbornly high prices. Existing-home sales, which comprise most of the housing market, fell 3.5 year-over-year in September and are on track for their worst year since 1995, according to the National Association of Realtors ("NAR"). While mortgage rates fell to near 6 in the build up to the Federal Reserve s interest-rate cut in September, they quickly reversed course in the subsequent weeks rebounding to their highest level in nearly three months by late October. 
 
 Housing affordability, particularly for first-time home buyers, remains an economic burden as the most recent NAR affordability index remained well below historic norms. 
 
 Interest Rate Levels and Volatility. The Federal Reserve seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 over the longer run. In support of these goals, at its meeting on September 18, 2024, the FOMC decided to lower the target range by 1/2 percentage point to 4.75 to 5 percent, indicating that "the Committee has gained greater confidence that the inflation rate is moving sustainably towards 2 , and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance."

 The level and volatility of interest rates, including the shape of the yield curve, were affected by several factors, principally efforts by the Federal Reserve beginning in late March 2022 to raise interest rates and tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. 
 
 As the FOMC raised short-term rates, portions of the Treasury yield curve became inverted. The 2-year rate was consistently higher than the 10-year rate. Investors use the 10-year Treasury yield as an indicator of investor confidence. However, with the rise in the 10-year rate in 2023 and 2024, the 2-year rate fell below the 10-year rate by September 30, 2024. 
 
 At its meeting on November 7, 2024, the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4.50 to 4.75 . 
 
 The FOMC stated that "The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate." 
 
 "In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective." 
 
 "In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming 
 information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate 
 if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee s goals." 
 
 Impact on Operating Results. Lending and investing activity by our member institutions is a key driver for our balance sheet and income growth. Such activity is a function of both prevailing interest rates and economic activity, including local economic factors, particularly relating to the housing and mortgage markets. Positive economic trends tend to increase demand by our members for advances to support their funding needs but can drive market interest rates higher, which can impair activity in the mortgage market. A less active mortgage market can affect demand for advances and activity levels in our Advantage MPP. However, member demand for liquidity, particularly during stressed market conditions, can also lead to advances growth. Borrowing patterns between our insurance company and depository members can differ during various economic and market conditions, thereby easing the potential magnitude of core business fluctuations during business cycles. 
 
 The level and trends of market interest rates and and the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve affect our yields and margins on earning assets, including advances, purchased mortgage loans, and our investment portfolio, which contribute to our overall profitability. Additionally, trends in market interest rates drive mortgage origination and prepayment activity, which can lead to net interest margin volatility in our MPP and MBS portfolios. A flat or inverted yield curve, in which the difference between short-term interest rates and long-term interest rates is low, or negative, respectively, may have an unfavorable impact on our net interest margins. A steep yield curve, in which the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates is high, may have a favorable impact on our net interest margins. The level of interest rates also directly affects our earnings on assets funded by our interest-free capital.

 The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily due to net changes in gains (losses) on investments, substantially offset by an increase in voluntary allocations to affordable housing, small business and community investment programs . 
 
 The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily due to higher earnings on the portion of the Bank's assets funded by its capital. However, such increase was substantially offset by net gains on the extinguishment of consolidated obligations in the corresponding period that did not occur in the current period and an increase in voluntary allocations to affordable housing, small business and community investment programs. 
 
 The net decrease in total OCI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was substantially due to net unrealized losses on AFS securities. The net increase in total OCI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was due to net unrealized gains on AFS securities.

 4 Total capital less AOCI plus MRCS. 
 
 Total assets at September 30, 2024 were 81.1 billion, a net increase of 4.5 billion, or 6 , from December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in advances outstanding. 
 
 Advances outstanding at September 30, 2024, at carrying value, totaled 38.6 billion, a net increase of 3.0 billion, or 9 , from December 31, 2023. The par value of advances outstanding increased by 7 to 38.5 billion, which included a net increase in short-term advances of 31 and a net decrease in long-term advances of 2 . At September 30, 2024, based on contractual maturities, long-term advances composed 67 of advances outstanding, while short-term advances composed 33 . 
 
 Mortgage loans held for portfolio at September 30, 2024 totaled 10.0 billion, a net increase of 1.3 billion, or 16 , from December 31, 2023, as the Bank's purchases from its members exceeded principal repayments by borrowers. Purchases of mortgage loans from members for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2.0 billion. 
 
 Liquidity investments at September 30, 2024 totaled 11.3 billion, a net decrease of 874 million, or 7 , from December 31, 2023. Cash and short-term investments represented 90 of the total liquidity investments at September 30, 2024, while U.S. Treasury obligations represented 10 . 
 
 Other investment securities, which consist substantially of MBS and U.S. Treasury obligations classified as HTM or AFS, at September 30, 2024 totaled 20.3 billion, a net increase of 881 million, or 5 , from December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank's consolidated obligations outs tanding at September 30, 2024 totaled 75.0 billion , a net increase of 3.9 billion , or 6 , from December 31, 2023 , which reflected increased funding needs associated with the net increase in the Bank's total assets. 
 38 
 Table of Contents 

Total capital at September 30, 2024 was 4.1 billion, a net increase of 383 million, or 10 , from December 31, 2023. The net increase resulted from issuances of capital stock to support advance activity, the growth in retained earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
 
 The Bank's regulatory capital-to-assets ratio at September 30, 2024 was 5.56 , which exceeds all applicable regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 Outlook. We believe that our financial performance will continue to provide sufficient, risk-adjusted returns for our members across a wide range of business, financial and economic environments. 
 
 The ultimate effects of economic and financial markets activity, including fiscal and monetary policies, the strength of the housing markets and the level and volatility of market interest rates, and legislative and regulatory actions continue to evolve and are highly uncertain and, therefore, the future impact on our business is difficult to predict. 
 
 Analysis of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1.1 billion, an increase of 116 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily driven by a net increase in yields resulting from higher market interest rates and a net increase in the average balances outstanding of interest-earning assets. 
 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 3.1 billion, an increase of 397 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in yields resulting from higher market interest rates and a net increase in the average balances outstanding of interest-earning assets. 
 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 960 million, an increase of 114 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in our cost of funds resulting from higher market interest rates and an increase in the average balances outstanding of interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2.8 billion, an increase of 368 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in our cost of funds resulting from higher market interest rates and an increase in the average balances outstanding of interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income is our primary source of earnings and is generated from the net interest spread on assets funded by liabilities and the yield on assets funded by interest-free capital as well as the average balances outstanding of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 The increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was due to several factors, none of which were significant. 
 
 The increase in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was substantially due to higher earnings on the portion of the Bank's assets funded by its capital. 
 
 For our hedging relationships that qualified for hedge accounting, the differences between the changes in fair value of the hedged items and the associated derivatives (i.e. hedge ineffectiveness) are recorded in net interest income and resulted in net hedging gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 4 million, compared to net hedging gains for the corresponding period in the prior year of 3 million, and net hedging gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 9 million, compared to net hedging gains for the corresponding period in the prior year of 8 million. 
 
 Our net gains (losses) on derivatives fluctuate due to volatility in the overall interest-rate environment as we hedge our asset or liability risk exposures. In general, we hold derivatives and associated hedged items to the maturity, call, or put date. Therefore, due to timing, nearly all of the cumulative net gains and losses for these financial instruments will generally reverse over the remaining contractual terms of the hedged item. However, there may be instances when we terminate these instruments prior to the maturity, call or put date, which may result in a realized gain or loss.

 The net increase in total other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior yea r was due to voluntary allocations to AHP and/or related programs. 
 
 The net increase in total other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was due to an increase in voluntary allocations to AHP and/or related programs. 
 
 Our voluntary allocations to our AHP or other affordable housing, small business and community investment programs are part of the Bank's commitment to allocate voluntary funding in 2024 totaling 23 million, based on 5 of its net earnings for 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the Bank also committed additional voluntary allocations of 10 million, raising the total voluntary allocation funding to 33 million, of which 17 million has been recognized. The timing of the recognition of such allocations in other expenses can vary due to the application of the accounting requirements related to unconditional promises to give. 
 
 AHP Assessments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , our required AHP expense was 11 million and 32 million, respectively. Our AHP expense fluctuates in accordance with our net earnings. 
 
 As a result, the Bank's combined required and voluntary allocation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 49 million, an increase of 11 million, or 30 , compared to the corresponding period in the prior year . 
 
 Total Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Total OCI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted substantially of net unrealized losses on AFS securities. Total OCI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted substantially of net unrealized gains on AFS securities compared to net unrealized losses for the corresponding period in the prior year. These amounts represent the portion of the changes in fair value that are not attributable to the risks being hedged in fair-value hedge relationships and were primarily impacted by changes in interest rates, credit spreads and volatility.

 Table of Contents 

Advances. In general, advances fluctuate in accordance with our members' funding needs, primarily determined by their deposit levels, mortgage pipelines, loan growth, investment opportunities, available collateral, other balance sheet strategies, and the cost of alternative funding options. 
 
 Advances at September 30, 2024 at carrying value totaled 38.6 billion, a net increase of 3.0 billion, or 9 , compared to December 31, 2023. Advances outstanding, at par, to our depository members increased by 2.5 billion, or 11 , and advances outstanding, at par, to our insurance company members increased by 137 million, or 1 , due to higher member demand for advances, especially for a particular short-term variable-rate product, to support their liquidity needs and manage their balance sheets in the current economic environment. 
 
 Our advances portfolio is well-diversified with advances to commercial banks and savings institutions, credit unions, and insurance companies. As a percent of total advances outstanding at par value, at September 30, 2024, advances to commercial banks and savings institutions were 50 and advances to credit unions were 15 , resulting in total advances to depository institutions of 65 , while advances to insurance companies were 35 .

 Purchases during the current periods increased compared to the corresponding prior periods due primarily to strong demand by our members to participate in our Advantage MPP. All of our mortgage loans have fixed interest rates. Fluctuations in mortgage market interest rates during the current periods resulted in modestly higher levels of prepayments by our borrowers compared to the corresponding prior periods.

Total Liabilities. Total liabilities at September 30, 2024 were 76.9 billion, a net increase of 4.1 billion, or 6 , from December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Deposits (Liabilities). Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 747 million, a net increase of 118 million, or 19 , from December 31, 2023. These deposits provide a relatively small portion of our funding but can fluctuate from period to period and vary depe nding upon such factors as the attractiveness of our deposit pricing relative to the rates available on alternative money market instruments, members' preferences with respect to the maturity of their investments, and members' liquidity. The balances of these accounts are uninsured. 
 
 Consolidated Obligations. The overall balance of our consolidated obligations fluctuates in relation to our total assets. The carrying value of consolidated obligations outstanding at September 30, 2024 totaled 75.0 billion, a net increase of 3.9 billion, or 6 , from December 31, 2023, which reflected increased funding needs associated with the net increase in the Bank's total assets. 
 
 The following table presents a breakdown by term of our consolidated obligations outstanding amounts in millions).

 The mix of our funding changed from December 31, 2023 as long-term CO bonds comprised a larger portion of consolidated obligations outstanding at September 30, 2024. We continue to seek to maintain a sufficient liquidity and funding balance between our financial assets and financial liabilities. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, callable CO bonds were 52 and 72 , respectively, of total CO bonds outstanding. The decrease resulted from less favorable market opportunities to issue callable CO bonds. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 76 and 82 , respectively, of our fixed-rate CO bonds were swapped using derivative instruments to effectively create variable-rate CO bonds, consistent with our balance sheet strategies to manage interest-rate risk. All of our variable-rate CO bonds outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were indexed to SOFR.

Derivatives. The volume of derivative hedges is often expressed in terms of notional amounts, which is the amount upon which interest payments are calculated. The following table presents the notional amounts by type of hedged item regardless of whether it is in a qualifying hedge relationship amounts in millions). 
 
 Hedged Item September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Advances 23,065 21,950 Investments 17,282 16,713 Mortgage loans MDCs 459 115 CO bonds 29,430 38,094 Discount notes 6,615 Total notional outstanding 76,851 76,872 
 
 The total notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2024 was consistent with the amount outstanding at December 31, 2023. The decrease in derivatives hedging CO bonds was driven primarily by an increase in simple variable-rate CO bonds outstanding. Substantially offsetting that decrease was the use of economic derivatives hedging discount notes to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates.

 Substantially all of the net cumulative fair-value hedging gains on AFS securities resulted from a previous strategy of terminating certain interest-rate swaps associated with certain MBS and entering into hedging relationships with new interest-rate swaps in connection with our London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition. Such gains include hedging basis adjustments that are being amortized into earnings as interest expense over the life of the original swap, but are generally being offset by the lower interest expense on the new swaps.

Liquidity 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are holdings of liquid assets, comprised of cash, short-term investments, and trading securities, as well as the issuance of consolidated obligations. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we maintained sufficient access to funding; our net proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations totaled 642.0 billion. 
 
 Changes in Cash Flow. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (135) million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 741 million. The net decrease in cash provided of 876 million was substantially due to the fluctuation in variation margin payments on cleared derivatives. Such payments are treated by the Clearinghouses as daily settled contracts.

 The net increase in total regulatory capital stock was substantially due to issuances of capital stock to support increases in advance activity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank voluntarily repurchased excess member stock totaling 81 million to reduce the amount of outstanding excess stock relative to the Bank's total assets.

Capital Distributions. The total amount of the dividend to be paid is based on the declared dividend rate for each sub-series of Class B capital stock and the average number of shares of each sub-series held by members during the dividend payment period (applicable quarter).

 2 Dividends paid in cash during the period, excluding the portion recorded as interest expense on MRCS, divided by net income for that same period. 
 
 On October 29, 2024, our board of directors declared a cash dividend on Class B-2 activity-based stock at an annualized rate of 9.50 and on Class B-1 non-activity-based stock at an annualized rate of 4.50 , resulting in a spread between the rates o f 5.00 percentage points. The overall weighted-average annualized rate paid on capital stock, including MRCS, was 7.91 . The dividends were paid in cash on October 30, 2024. 
 
 Adequacy of Capital. We must maintain sufficient permanent capital to meet the combined credit risk, market risk and operational risk components of the risk-based capital requirement. The following table presents our risk-based capital requirement in relation to our permanent capital at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounts in mill ions).

 The decrease in our total risk-based capital requirement was primarily caused by a decrease in the credit risk component due to changes in the balance sheet composition and classification. The operational risk component is calculated as 30 of the credit and market risk components. Our permanent capital at September 30, 2024 remained well in excess of our total risk-based capital requirement.

 Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Member Credit Risk Management. On September 27, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth Finance Agency s expectations that an FHLBank s underwriting and credit decisions should reflect a member s financial condition and not rely solely on the collateral securing the member s credit obligations. The advisory bulletin provides guidance for the FHLBanks to implement policies for credit risk governance, member credit assessment and monitoring of credit conditions, among other considerations. It also provides guidance on the oversight of members in financial distress by recommending implementation of escalation policies, processes for coordination with members prudential regulators, and management policies addressing default, failure, and insolvency situations. We are evaluating this advisory bulletin relative to our current member credit risk management policies and procedures to assess its potential impact on us and our operations. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on Federal Home Loan Bank System Climate-Related Risk Management. On September 30, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the FHFA s expectation that each FHLBank should integrate climate-related risk management into its existing enterprise risk management framework over time. The advisory bulletin provides that an effective framework should address climate-related risk governance, such as selection of the related risk appetite and setting strategy and objectives, establishing and implementing plans to mitigate and monitor and report material exposures to such risks, and establishing roles and responsibilities for the board of directors and management. The advisory bulletin requires the FHLBanks to establish metrics that track exposure to climate-related risks and collect related data to quantify risk exposures, conduct climate-related scenario analyses, implement processes to report and communicate climate-related risks to internal stakeholders, and have a plan to respond to natural disasters and support climate resiliency. We are evaluating the potential impact of the advisory bulletin on us and our operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Unsecured Credit Limits for Federal Home Loan Banks. On October 3, 2024, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of December 2, 2024 to amend the Finance Agency s regulation on capital requirements (the Capital Regulation) to modify unsecured credit limits for FHLBanks. The proposed rule would include interest bearing deposit accounts (IBDAs) in a category of authorized overnight investments that would be excluded from the general limit on unsecured credit to a single counterparty. IBDAs are non-maturity deposits in approved counterparties which may be used to manage liquidity. The proposed rule would, among other things, increase the frequency of the required performance of certain capital calculations and clarify that certain non-interest-bearing deposit accounts (such as settlement, payment or other transactional accounts) are to be considered unsecured extensions of credit subject to the Capital Regulation s unsecured general or overall (less restrictive) limit. Although excluding IBDAs from the general unsecured credit limit could provide greater flexibility for our liquidity management, several of the other proposed changes, if adopted, could result in significant changes to our current business processes. We are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on us and our operations.

Proposed Rule on FHLBank System Boards of Directors and Executive Management. On October 21, 2024, the Finance Agency proposed revisions to its regulations addressing boards of directors and overall corporate governance of the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. The comment deadline is February 3, 2025. If adopted as presented, the proposed rule would, among other things: (i) impact director compensation by allowing the Director of the Finance Agency to establish an annual amount of director compensation that the Director determines is reasonable; (ii) require us to complete and submit background checks to the Finance Agency on every nominee for a directorship; (iii) impact public interest independent director qualifications, in part by requiring a person to have advocated for, or otherwise acted primarily on behalf of or for the direct benefit of, consumers or the community to meet the representation requirement; (iv) expand the list of qualifying experiences for our independent directors to include artificial intelligence, information technology and security, climate-related risk, CDFIs, business models, and modeling; and (v) establish a review process for director performance and participation, together with a process for removing directors for cause. Other proposed revisions address, among other things, FHLBank conflict of interests policies applicable to all employees, including specific limitations on executive officers and senior management and record retention. While some proposed revisions would codify existing guidance and practice, several of the proposed revisions could result in significant changes impacting the nomination, election and retention of directors for our board. Additional director eligibility requirements and limitations on and potential reductions or limitations to director compensation resulting from the proposed rule could hinder our ability to recruit and retain the talent and expertise that are critical to our ability to satisfy our mission, particularly given the growing complexities of the finance industry. We continue to analyze the impact that the proposed rule could have on us. 

Risk Management 
 
 We have exposure to a number of risks in pursuing our business objectives. These risks may be broadly classified as market, credit, liquidity, operational, and business. Market risk is discussed in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . For additional information, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Credit Risk Management. We face credit risk on advances and other credit products, investments, mortgage loans, derivative financial instruments, and AHP grants. 
 
 Advances and Other Credit Products. 
 
 Concentration. Our credit risk is magnified due to the concentration of advances in a few borrowers. As of September 30, 2024, our top borrower held 12 of total advances outstanding, at par, and our top five borrowers held 39 of total advances outstanding, at par. Because of this concentration in advances, we perform frequent credit and collateral reviews on our largest borrowers. In addition, we regularly analyze the implications to our financial management and profitability if we were to lose the business of one or more of these borrowers. The following table presents the par value of advances outstanding to our largest borrowers amounts in millions).

 Trading Securities. Our liquidity portfolio includes shorter-term U.S. Treasury obligations, which are direct obligations of the U.S. government and are classified as trading securities. 
 
 Other Investment Securities. Our long-term investments include MBS guaranteed by the housing GSEs (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), other U.S. obligations - guaranteed MBS (Ginnie Mae), longer-term U.S. Treasury obligations, and debentures issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the TVA and the Federal Farm Credit Banks. 
 
 A Finance Agency regulation provides that the total amount of our investments in MBS, calculated using amortized historical cost excluding the impact of certain derivatives adjustments, must not exceed 300 of our total regulatory capital, as of the day we purchase the securities, based on the capital amount most recently reported to the Finance Agency. If our outstanding investments in MBS exceed the limitation at any time, but were in compliance at the time we purchased the investments, we would not be considered out of compliance with the regulation, but we would not be permitted to purchase additional investments in MBS until these outstanding investments were within the limitation. Generally, our goal is to maintain investments in MBS near the 300 regulatory limit in order to enhance earnings and capital for our members and diversify our revenue stream. At September 30, 2024, these investments totaled 295 of total regulatory capital.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Measuring Market Risks 
 
 To evaluate market risk, we utilize multiple risk measurements, including Value-at-Risk, duration of equity, convexity, changes in MVE, duration gap, and earnings at risk. Periodically, we conduct stress tests to measure and analyze the effects that extreme movements in the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve would have on our risk position. 
 
 Key Metrics. The following table presents certain market and interest-rate metrics under different interest-rate scenarios amounts in millions).

 The changes in these key metrics from December 31, 2023 resulted primarily from the change in market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities in response to changes in the market environment, model enhancements, changes in portfolio composition and our hedging strategies. 
 
 Duration Gap. The base case duration gap at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 0.05 and 0.00 , respectively.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is: (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms; and (b) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer), Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer) and Chief Accounting Officer (the principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act, that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and other internal controls will prevent all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can only be reasonable assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Additionally, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
