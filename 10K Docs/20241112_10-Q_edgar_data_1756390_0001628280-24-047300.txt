When the Company acquires assets and liabilities that do not constitute a business or VIE of which the Company is the primary beneficiary, the cost of each acquisition, including certain transaction costs, is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Contingent consideration associated with the acquisition is generally recognized only when the contingency is resolved. 
 When the Company acquires assets and liabilities that do not constitute a business but meet the definition of a VIE of which the Company is the primary beneficiary, the purchase is accounted for using the acquisition method described above for business combinations, except that no goodwill is recognized. To the extent there is a difference between the purchase consideration, including the estimated fair value of contingent consideration, plus the estimated fair value of any non-controlling interest and the VIE s identifiable assets and liabilities recorded and measured at fair value, the difference is recognized as a gain or loss. A non-controlling interest represents the non-affiliated equity interest in the underlying entity. Transaction costs are expensed.

 The internal revenue service has taken the position that cannabis companies are subject to the limitations of IRC Section 280E, under which such companies are only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to the sales of product. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under IRC Section 280E and those allowed for financial statement reporting purposes book-to-tax differences). Cannabis companies operating in states that align their tax codes with IRC Section 280E are also unable to deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses for state tax purposes. Ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-deductible under IRC Section 280E are treated as permanent book-to-tax differences. Therefore, the effective tax rate on income realized by cannabis companies can be highly variable and may not necessarily correlate with pre-tax income or loss. 
 The Company s quarterly tax provision is calculated under the discrete method which treats the interim period as if it were the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis. The discrete method is applied when application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The Company believes, at this time, the use of this discrete method is more appropriate than the annual effective tax rate method due to the high degree of uncertainty in estimating annual pre-tax income due to the early growth stage of the business. 
 The Company has recorded an uncertain tax liability for uncertain tax positions primarily related to the treatment of certain transactions and deductions under IRC Section 280E based on legal interpretations that challenge the Company s tax liability under IRC Section 280E. These uncertain tax positions are included within Other non-current liabilities on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

If favorably resolved, the unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the Company s effective tax rate.

 of additional funding may be provided pursuant to the research collaboration agreement and is expected to be funded over the course of the following the transaction date based on a percentage of annual revenues associated with the underlying operations, of which none has been funded to date. This additional is included within Other non-current liabilities on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Legal and Other Matters 
 The Company s operations are subject to a variety of local and state regulations. Failure to comply with one or more of those regulations could result in fines, restrictions on its operations, or losses of permits that could result in the Company ceasing operations. While management believes that the Company is in compliance with applicable local and state regulations as of September 30, 2024 in all material respects, cannabis regulations continue to evolve and are subject to differing interpretations, and accordingly, the Company may be subject to regulatory fines, penalties, or restrictions in the future. 
 State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution, and use of cannabis for adult-use or medical purposes are in direct conflict with the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811) (the CSA ), which makes cannabis use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical and/or adult-use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal and any such acts are criminal acts under federal law under the CSA. Although the Company s activities are believed to be compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company. 
 The Company may be, from time to time, subject to various administrative, regulatory, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Contingent liabilities associated with legal proceedings are recorded when a liability is probable and the contingent liability can be estimated. We do not accrue for contingent losses that, in our judgment, are considered to be reasonably possible but not probable. At September 30, 2024 there were no pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, other than as disclosed below. 
 MedMen NY Litigation 
 On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive investment agreement (the Investment Agreement with subsidiaries of MedMen Enterprises Inc. MedMen ), under which we would have, subject to regulatory approval, completed an investment (the Investment of approximately in MedMen NY, Inc. MMNY ), a licensed medical cannabis operator in the state of New York. Following the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement, we were expected to hold all the outstanding equity of MMNY. Specifically, the Investment Agreement provided that at closing, the Company was going to pay to MedMen s senior lenders , less certain transaction costs and a prepaid deposit of , and AWH New York, LLC was going to issue a senior secured promissory note in favor of MMNY s senior secured lender in the principal amount of , guaranteed by AWH, which cash investment and note would be used to reduce the 
 33 

Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc. 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (in thousands, except per unit or per share data) 

of the equity in MMNY, and be provided with an option to acquire MedMen s remaining interest in MMNY in the future for a nominal additional payment, which option the Company intended to exercise. The Investment Agreement also required AWH to make an additional investment of in MMNY, which investment would also be used to repay MMNY s senior secured lender, if adult-use cannabis sales commenced in MMNY s dispensaries. 
 The Company contends that, in December 2021, the parties to the Investment Agreement received the required approvals from the State of New York to close the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement, but MedMen has disputed the adequacy of the approvals provided by the State of New York. The Company delivered notice to MedMen in December 2021 that it wished to close the transactions as required by the Investment Agreement. Nevertheless, MedMen, on January 2, 2022, gave notice to the Company that MedMen purported to terminate the Investment Agreement. 
 Following receipt of such notice, on January 13, 2022, the Company filed a complaint against MedMen and others in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York (the Court ), requesting specific performance that the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement must move forward, and such other relief as the Court may deem appropriate. The Company simultaneously moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction (the Motion requiring MedMen to operate its New York business in the ordinary course of business and to refrain from any activities or transactions that might impair, encumber, or dissipate MedMen s New York assets. The parties resolved the Motion via a Stipulation and Order entered by the Court on January 21, 2022 that required that MMNY operate only in compliance with the law and in a manner consistent with its ordinary course of business that preserved all assets of MMNY. It further required MMNY to not take certain actions, including any actions that would have a material adverse effect on MedMen s New York business. On March 27, 2023, the parties entered a further stipulation that modified the January 21, 2022 Stipulation and Order by lifting the Court s prohibition against a sale or transfer of MMNY or its assets, without waiver of any claims that the Company might have in the event of such a transaction. That further stipulation modifying the January 21, 2022 Stipulation and Order was entered by the Court on August 1, 2023. 
 On January 24, 2022, MedMen filed counterclaims against the Company, alleging that Ascend had breached the Investment Agreement, and seeking declaratory relief that MedMen had properly terminated the Investment Agreement. On February 14, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss MedMen s counterclaims and filed an amended complaint (the First Amended Complaint that included additional claims against MedMen for breach of contract. The First Amended Complaint contained several causes of action, including for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The First Amended Complaint sought damages in addition to continuing to seek injunctive and declaratory relief. On March 7, 2022, MedMen filed amended counterclaims, an answer, and affirmative defenses to the First Amended Complaint. On March 28, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss MedMen s amended counterclaims. On April 20, 2022, the parties entered into a stipulation extending the time for MedMen to oppose the Company s motion to dismiss until May 5, 2022. In addition, the parties agreed to stay all discovery, including both party and non-party discovery. On May 5, 2022, the parties filed another stipulation order with the Court adjourning until further notice from the Court MedMen s time to oppose the Company s motion to dismiss MedMen s amended counterclaims. The parties again stipulated that all discovery remains stayed pending further order from the Court. 
 On May 10, 2022, the Company and MedMen signed a term sheet (the Term Sheet ), pursuant to which the parties agreed to use best efforts to enter into a settlement agreement and enter into new or amended transactional documents. Specifically, if consummated, the agreements contemplated by the Term Sheet would have entailed, among other things, the Company paying MedMen in additional transaction consideration, and MedMen withdrawing its counterclaims against the Company. Per the amended transaction terms contemplated in the Term Sheet, upon closing, the Company would have received a controlling interest in MMNY and the Company would have paid MedMen , which reflected the original transaction consideration plus an additional per the parties Term Sheet, less a deposit that the Company already paid.

deposit, approximately of advances pursuant to a working capital loan agreement (as described in Note 6, Notes Receivable and other capital expenditure advances paid to MMNY by the Company. 
 On November 21, 2022, the parties entered into a stipulation whereby MedMen agreed to the filing of the Second Amended Complaint, which is now the Company s operative pleading in the litigation. In addition, in the stipulation, the Company agreed that it would not contest MedMen s filing of second amended counterclaims against the Company while reserving all rights with respect to any such counterclaims. Because the parties agreed to the filing of each side s amended pleadings, on November 28, 2022, the Court determined that Ascend s March 2022 motion to dismiss was moot. 
 On December 21, 2022, MedMen filed its second amended counterclaims, an answer, and affirmative defenses to the Company s Second Amended Complaint. In addition to the allegations in MedMen s earlier pleadings, MedMen now also alleged that the Company breached the Term Sheet. On January 20, 2023, the Company moved to dismiss MedMen s second amended counterclaims. 
 On August 18, 2023, the Court issued a Decision and Order on the Company s motion to dismiss, dismissing of MedMen s counterclaims, including each of the counterclaims brought by MedMen relating to the Term Sheet. On September 26, 2023, MedMen filed a motion seeking leave to file its third amended counterclaims, in which MedMen seeks to revive its previously dismissed counterclaims relating to the Term Sheet. On October 24, 2023, the Company filed an opposition to that motion for leave. As further discussed below, the Court denied that motion on February 2, 2024. In addition, on October 18, 2023, MedMen filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court s August 18, 2023 Decision and Order with respect to the dismissal of MedMen s three counterclaims relating to the Term Sheet. On November 1, 2023 the Company filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal with respect to the Court s determination that the Company s motion to dismiss was not subject to New York s anti-SLAPP statute. Both parties have yet to perfect the appeals. 
 On February 2, 2024, the Court issued a Decision and Order denying MedMen s motion for leave to file its third amended counterclaims. 
 On February 21, 2024, the current counsel-of-record for MedMen filed an order to show cause with the Court seeking leave to withdraw as counsel and stay proceedings for thirty days to permit MedMen time to obtain new counsel. On March 20, 2024, the Court granted such withdrawal motion and appointed April 25, 2024 as the deadline for MedMen to obtain new counsel, which, as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, had not occurred. 
 On April 26, 2024, MedMen announced that it made an assignment into bankruptcy pursuant to Canada s Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act on April 24, 2024 and B. Riley Farber Inc. was appointed as its bankruptcy trustee. In addition, MedMen announced that MedMen s wholly owned subsidiary, MM CAN USA, Inc., a California corporation, was placed into receivership in the Los Angeles Superior Court, Santa Monica Division on April 23, 2024 to effectuate an orderly dissolution and liquidation of its California-based assets. MedMen further announced that it intends to initiate additional receivership proceedings in those U.S. states where MM CAN USA, Inc. controls or owns assets, through which the operations and assets of MedMen s subsidiaries will be dissolved or liquidated pursuant to applicable laws in the United States. On May 21, 2024, the Los Angeles Superior Court issued an order

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 Established in 2018 and headquartered in Morristown, New Jersey, AWH is a vertically integrated multi-state operator focused on adult-use or near-term adult-use cannabis states in limited license markets. Our core business is the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods, which we sell through our company-owned retail stores and to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. We believe in bettering lives through cannabis. Our mission is to improve the lives of our employees, patients, customers, and the communities we serve through the use of the cannabis plant. We are committed to providing safe, reliable, and high-quality products and providing consumers options and education to ensure they are able to identify and obtain the products that fit their personal needs. 
 Since our formation, we have expanded our operational footprint, primarily through acquisitions, and, as of September 30, 2024, had direct or indirect operations or financial interests in seven United States geographic markets: Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. While we have been successful in opening facilities and dispensaries, we expect continued growth to be driven by opening new operational facilities and dispensaries under our current licenses, expansion of our current facilities, and increased consumer demand. We currently employ approximately 2,300 people. 
 Our consumer products portfolio is generated primarily from plant material that we grow and process ourselves. As of September 30, 2024, we produce our consumer packaged goods in seven manufacturing facilities with 255,000 square feet of total canopy. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold approximately 48,000 and 141,000 pounds of wholesale product, on a gross basis, respectively, compared to 40,000 and 101,000 pounds during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In January 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a cultivation license and a manufacturer license that we intend to use at a second cultivation site in Massachusetts to further expand our production capacity in that market. We added approximately 15,000 square feet of total additional canopy with this additional site, which build out was largely completed during the second quarter of 2024, and anticipate the transaction will close in early 2025. Our product portfolio consists of a range of cannabis product categories including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vapes, edibles, and other cannabis-related products. As of September 30, 2024, we have 39 open and operating retail locations, which includes 2 partner locations, and by the end of 2024 we expect to have 40 total retail locations, including 2 partner locations. Our new store opening plans are flexible and will ultimately depend on market conditions, local licensing, construction, and other regulatory permissions. We are also pursuing opportunities to partner with social equity license holders to expand our presence in various states. All of our expansion plans are subject to capital allocations decisions, the evolving regulatory environment, and the general economic environment. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Business Developments 
 The Company is continuously reviewing its footprint in order to optimize its operations, including expansion opportunities across the markets in which it operates. Some of the highlights achieved during the quarter include: 
 commencing non-medical sales at five dispensaries in Ohio; 
 opening a fifth dispensary in Pennsylvania; and 
 generating positive net cash from operating activities and refinancing a portion of our previously outstanding debt obligations, as further described in Liquidity and Capital Resources .

Recent and Pending Transactions 
 Massachusetts Cultivation 
 In January 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the Massachusetts Purchase Agreement to purchase a cultivation and manufacturer license from a third party in Massachusetts for a cash purchase price of 2,750, which total may be adjusted at final closing as provided in the Massachusetts Purchase Agreement and of which 1,500 was paid at signing and 1,250 was paid on October 1, 2024. The transfer of each license is subject to regulatory review and approval, which the Company expects may occur within twelve months following the signing date. The licenses were not associated with active operations at signing, but operations have since commenced. In conjunction with the Massachusetts Purchase Agreement, the parties also entered into a bridge loan which provides for the financing of certain covered expenses, at the sole discretion of the Company. This bridge loan bears interest based on the federal funds rate and, if not otherwise satisfied, is due on the fifth anniversary of the signing date. The parties also entered into an interim consulting services agreement, effective as of the signing date. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition as of the signing date based on the provisions of the underlying agreements and allocated the cash consideration as the cost of the license acquired. The Company has agreed to assume the lease for the associated location and to reimburse the seller for the security deposit at final closing. The Company recognized a lease liability and right-of-use ROU asset of 761 as of the signing date. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Financial Statements for additional information related to this transaction and to Note 10, Leases, for additional information regarding the Company s leases. 
 Detroit License 
 In September 2024, the Company acquired 49 of the member interests of an entity (the Detroit License Holder that received a conditional approval for an adult-use license in Detroit, Michigan (the Detroit License ). The Detroit License was not associated with active operations as of the closing date and the Detroit License Holder had no other active operations as of that date. The Company anticipates transferring the Detroit License to its existing dispensary in Detroit, Michigan, subject to regulatory approvals. The Company paid 850 of cash consideration at closing and the sellers may receive up to an additional 2,250 based upon the achievement of certain levels of sales during a specified twelve month period following the commencement of adult-use sales at the dispensary. The underlying agreement also provides the Company with an option to acquire the remaining ownership interests in the Detroit License Holder, after such is permissible by applicable regulations, for no additional consideration. The parties also entered into a management services agreement, pursuant to which the Company is providing management and advisory services for a set monthly fee, which is expected to expire upon the Company s exercise of the option. 
 The Company determined that the Detroit License Holder is a variable interest entity VIE and the Company became the primary beneficiary as of the closing date; therefore, the Detroit License Holder is consolidated as a VIE. The total transaction consideration of 1,140 was allocated to the license acquired and consisted of the 850 of cash consideration plus the initial estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of 290. The Company determined the fair value of any noncontrolling interest is de minimis . Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Financial Statements for additional information related to this transaction and to Note 8, Variable Interest Entities, for additional information regarding the Company s VIEs.

Ohio Patient Access 
 On August 12, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the Ohio Agreement that provides the Company the option to acquire 100 of the equity of Ohio Patient Access LLC OPA ), the holder of a license that grants it the right to operate three medical dispensaries in Ohio. The Ohio Agreement remains subject to regulatory review and approval. Once regulatory approval is received, the Company may exercise the option, and the exercise is solely within the Company s control. The Company anticipates exercising the option prior to the March 22, 2026 amended expiration date. Under the Ohio Agreement, the Company will also acquire the real property of the three dispensary locations. OPA had not yet commenced operations as of the signing date, but subsequently opened two dispensaries in December 2023 and a third in January 2024. The Company determined OPA is a VIE and the Company became the primary beneficiary as of the signing date; therefore, OPA is consolidated as a VIE. 
 The Ohio Agreement also includes an earn-out provision of 7,300 that is dependent upon the commencement of adult-use cannabis sales in Ohio and which the sellers could elect to receive as either cash or shares of the Company s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof. The sellers elected to receive the payment in cash and such payment was made in July 2024. The parties amended the Ohio Agreement in June 2024 to incorporate certain provisions regarding evolving regulations in Ohio, including that the Company will, upon final closing of the Ohio Agreement, receive two additional adult-use licenses that are expected to be awarded to OPA. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Financial Statements for additional information related to this transaction and to Note 8, Variable Interest Entities, for additional information regarding the Company s VIEs. 
 Illinois Licenses 
 In August 2022, the Company entered into definitive agreements to acquire two additional licenses in Illinois for combined total cash consideration of 11,100. Operations at one of the locations commenced during the second quarter of 2023 and the final closing occurred in April 2024. Operations at the second location commenced during the fourth quarter of 2023 and final closing occurred in July 2024. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Financial Statements for additional information related to these transactions. 
 Variable Interest Entities 
 January 2024 Loan Agreement 
 In January 2024, the Company entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which the Company may provide, at its sole discretion, up to 2,500 of financing to a third party (the January 2024 Loan Agreement ). The January 2024 Loan Agreement contains certain provisions and restrictive covenants that provide the Company with operational and financial influence over the underlying entity and also provides the Company with financial distributions based on the underlying associated results of operations. Additionally, the January 2024 Loan Agreement provides the Company with conversion options to obtain 35 of the equity interests of the borrower upon the initial funding (which occurred in January 2024) and up to an additional 65 of the remaining equity interest of the borrower at any time through October 2033, subject to certain provisions and regulatory approvals. The Company determined that the terms and provisions of the January 2024 Loan Agreement create a variable interest in the third-party entity and met the criteria for consolidation as a VIE as of such date. The third-party entity received a conditional license approval for one dispensary in New Jersey that was determined to have a fair value of 1,050, which approximated the fair value of the non-controlling interest held by the third-party as of the effective date. The net loss attributable to the non-controlling interest was not significant during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Since the entity is consolidated as a VIE, the intercompany activity related to the January 2024 Loan Agreement is eliminated in consolidation. Refer to Note 8, Variable Interest Entities, in the Financial Statements for additional information regarding this transaction and the Company s VIEs. 
 41 

February 2024 Loan Agreement 
 In February 2024, the Company entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which the Company may provide financing to a third party at its sole discretion (the February 2024 Loan Agreement ). The February 2024 Loan Agreement initially provided for up to 3,750 of financing, but was amended in July 2024 to increase the funding amount based on the Company s sole discretion at such a time that the borrower requests additional funding. The parties also entered into a support services agreement under which the Company will provide management and advisory services for a set monthly fee. The terms of the February 2024 Loan Agreement contain certain provisions and restrictive covenants that provide the Company with operational and financial influence over the underlying entity. The February 2024 Loan Agreement provides the Company with the option to convert the outstanding balance into equity interests of the borrower, up to 100 , as may be permissible by applicable regulations at such time. The Company determined that the terms and provisions of the February 2024 Loan Agreement and support services agreement create a variable interest in the third-party entity and met the criteria for consolidation as a VIE as of such date. The entity held no assets at the time the agreements were entered into and the non-controlling interest was determined to have a de minimis fair value as of that date. Since the entity is consolidated as a VIE, the intercompany activity related to the February 2024 Loan Agreement and the related support services agreement is eliminated in consolidation. 
 Effective in April 2024, this third party acquired two dispensaries in the greater Chicago, Illinois area (the Chicago Partner Dispensaries ). The parties entered into interim management services agreements MSAs pursuant to which the consolidated VIE will advise on certain business, operational, and financial matters for a monthly fee while the parties finalize asset purchase agreements to acquire the underlying dispensaries (the Illinois MSAs ). The total purchase price of approximately 10,000 of cash consideration is subject to certain closing adjustments. An initial deposit of 1,500 was remitted during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The remainder of 8,500 was remitted to escrow during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and remained in escrow as of September 30, 2024. The asset purchase agreements in respect of the Chicago Partner Dispensaries are subject to regulatory review and approval. Based on the provisions of the Illinois MSAs, the third party obtained operational and financial influence over the dispensaries and therefore recognized the transaction as a business combination as of the April 2024 regulatory approval date of the Illinois MSAs. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, in the Financial Statements for additional information related to this transaction and Note 8, Variable Interest Entities, for additional information regarding the Company s VIEs. 
 Operational and Regulation Overview 
 We believe our operations are in material compliance with all applicable state and local laws, regulations, and licensing requirements in the states in which we operate. However, cannabis is illegal under United States federal law. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from United States cannabis operations. For information about risks related to United States cannabis operations, refer to Item 1A., Risk Factors , of the Annual Report. 
 
 Key Financial Highlights 
 Revenue increased by 379 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by incremental revenue from acquisitions and expansion of our cultivation activities, largely offset by declines in certain legacy markets. 
 Operating loss of 2,417 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to operating income of 3,547 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by higher general and administrative expenses largely attributable to certain one time costs, including expenses associated with our debt refinancing and other strategic initiatives. 
 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 7,229 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by payments associated with acquisitions, investments in capital assets, and debt issuance costs, all partially offset by a benefit from the timing and amount of tax payments, including certain tax refunds received, as well as the timing of timing of payments related to working capital activities and the collection of a note receivable.

 Not meaningful 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 379 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The modest increase was primarily driven by 8,043 of incremental net revenue from our wholesale operations, in large part as a result of expansion across certain markets, particularly in New Jersey and Massachusetts. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold approximately 48,000 pounds of wholesale product, on a gross basis, compared to 40,000 pounds during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, we recognized 8,708 of incremental revenue from acquisitions, which includes a benefit from store openings in 2024 and late 2023 associated with previously acquired licenses and a benefit from the commencement of non-medical sales in Ohio, as well as a contribution of 1,323 of incremental revenue from partner stores. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 17,695 across our legacy locations, primarily in Illinois, New Jersey, and Massachusetts due to increased competition in those markets. 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 Cost of goods sold increased by 206 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of goods sold represents direct and indirect expenses attributable to the production of wholesale products as well as direct expenses incurred in purchasing products from other wholesalers. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 43,729, representing a gross margin of 30.9 , compared to gross profit of 43,556 and gross margin of 30.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin for the current quarter was impacted by increased competition in certain markets, partially offset by improved utilization at our Massachusetts and New Jersey cultivation facilities and expansion of wholesale sales in those markets, as well as a benefit from the commencement of non-medical sales in Ohio. The current period also benefited from 1,189 of lower write-downs of certain inventory items that were largely driven by pricing pressure in the prior year. 
 43 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 6,137, or 15 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by: 
 4,546 of higher professional services fees, including expenses associated with our debt refinancing and other projects and strategic initiatives; 
 a 2,083 reserve recognized on a long-term receivable; 
 a 2,079 increase in compensation expense due to higher average senior leadership headcount associated with the expansion of operations and severance costs associated with strategic streamlining in certain departments; 
 a 1,269 increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to 896 of incremental amortization of licenses from prior year acquisitions and 373 of incremental depreciation expense associated with a larger average balance of fixed assets in service; and 
 853 of higher marketing expenses. 
 These increases were partially offset by 3,493 of lower equity-based compensation expense driven by a reversal of expense associated with the forfeiture of certain awards during the current period as well as the absence of a 1,259 expense related to the write-off of certain previously capitalized construction projects recognized during the prior year period. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 7,518, or 84 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a 5,475 net loss on extinguishment associated with the prepayment of 215,000 of principal previously outstanding under a credit facility and higher cash interest associated with new term notes (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information). These increases were partially offset by lower non-cash interest accretion due to a lower average balance outstanding under a financing agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a weighted-average outstanding debt balance of 325,477 with a weighted-average interest rate of 10.9 , excluding finance leases, compared to a weighted-average debt balance of 316,732 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 with a weighted-average interest rate of 9.6 . 
 Other, net 
 Other, net decreased by 493, or 55 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower interest income due to the absence of a loan receivable in the current year period. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The Company s quarterly tax provision is calculated under the discrete method which treats the interim period as if it were the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis. The discrete method is applied when application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The Company believes, at this time, the use of this discrete method is more appropriate than the annual effective tax rate method due to the high degree of uncertainty in estimating annual pre-tax income due to the early growth stage of the business. 
 44 

The internal revenue service has taken the position that cannabis companies are subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 280E, under which such companies are only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to the sales of product. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under IRC Section 280E and those allowed for financial statement reporting purposes book-to-tax differences). Cannabis companies operating in states that align their tax codes with IRC Section 280E are also unable to deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses for state tax purposes. Ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-deductible under IRC Section 280E are treated as permanent book-to-tax differences. Therefore, the effective tax rate on income realized by cannabis companies can be highly variable and may not necessarily correlate with pre-tax income or loss. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an uncertain tax liability totaling 126,401 for uncertain tax positions related to the treatment of certain transactions and deductions under IRC Section 280E based on legal interpretations that challenge the Company s tax liability under IRC Section 280E. The Company has been selected for examination of its amended tax returns filed with these unrecognized tax benefits but does not currently anticipate its unrecognized tax benefits to be resolved in the next twelve months and anticipates that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months for additional uncertain tax positions taken on a go-forward basis. If favorably resolved, the unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the Company s effective tax rate. 
 The statutory federal tax rate was 21 during both periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 the Company had operations in seven U.S. geographic markets: Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, which have state tax rates ranging from 6 to 11.5 . Certain states, including Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and New Jersey, do not align with IRC Section 280E for state tax purposes and permit the deduction of ordinary and necessary business expenses from gross profit in the calculation of state taxable income. There have been no material changes to income tax matters in connection with the normal course of our operations during the current year. 
 Income tax expense was 9,767, or 22.3 , of gross profit, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6,726, or 15.4 , of gross profit, during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate on gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by higher penalties and interest due on tax payments and uncertain tax positions and the tax treatment of certain accounting reserves, partially offset by a benefit from an incremental impact attributable to the tax treatment of certain acquired intangible assets. Refer to Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s income taxes.

 Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 47,161, or 12 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by 39,141 of incremental net revenue from our wholesale operations, in large part as a result of expansion across the markets in which we operate, particularly in New Jersey and Massachusetts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold approximately 141,000 pounds of wholesale product, on a gross basis, compared to 101,000 pounds during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, we recognized 39,194 of incremental revenue from acquisitions, including 17,590 from the Devi Maryland acquisition that occurred during the second quarter of 2023. This incremental increase was also driven by new store openings in 2024 and late 2023 associated with previously acquired licenses, including a benefit from the commencement of non-medical sales in Ohio, as well as a contribution of 1,435 of incremental revenue from partner stores. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 32,609 across our legacy locations, primarily in Illinois and New Jersey due to increased competition in those markets. 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 Cost of goods sold increased by 17,401, or 6 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of goods sold represents direct and indirect expenses attributable to the production of wholesale products as well as direct expenses incurred in purchasing products from other wholesalers. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 137,339, representing a gross margin of 32.3 , compared to gross profit of 107,579 and gross margin of 28.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin for the current period benefited from improved utilization at our Massachusetts and New Jersey cultivation facilities and expansion of wholesale sales in those markets, as well as a benefit from the commencement of non-medical sales in Ohio, partially offset by increased competition in certain markets. The current period also benefited from 10,829 of lower write-downs of certain inventory items that were largely driven by pricing pressure in the prior year.

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 26,941, or 24 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to: 
 a 8,224 increase in total compensation expense due to higher average senior leadership headcount associated with the expansion of operations and severance costs associated with strategic streamlining in certain departments, which was partly offset by a reduction of equity-based compensation expense due to the forfeiture of certain awards in the current period; 
 6,173 of higher professional services fees, including expenses associated with our debt refinancing and other projects and strategic initiatives; 
 a 5,447 increase in an estimated reserve related to certain amounts associated with a previous transaction (refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Legal Matters MedMen NY Litigation for additional information); 
 a 4,131 increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to 2,551 of incremental amortization of licenses driven by prior year acquisitions and 1,580 of incremental depreciation expense due to a larger average balance of fixed assets in service; 
 a 2,083 reserve and 984 discount recognized on a long-term receivable; 
 a 1,723 increase in overhead expenses due to expansion of operations; and 
 728 of higher marketing expenses. 
 These increases were partially offset by the absence of a 1,804 estimated reserve for a note receivable and the absence of a 1,259 expense related to the write-off of certain previously capitalized construction projects that were recognized during the prior year period. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 5,135, or 18 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a 5,475 net loss on extinguishment associated with the prepayment of 215,000 of principal previously outstanding under a credit facility and higher cash interest associated with new term notes (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information). These increases were partially offset by lower non-cash interest accretion due to a lower average balance outstanding under a financing agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a weighted-average outstanding debt balance of 319,014 with a weighted-average interest rate of 10.9 , excluding finance leases, compared to a weighted-average debt balance of 328,327 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with a weighted-average interest rate of 9.8 . 
 Other, net 
 Other, net decreased by 24,113 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the absence of a 22,794 employee retention tax credit claim (the ERTC Claim recognized during the prior year period and lower interest income due to the absence of a loan receivable in the current year period.

Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 34,383, or 25.0 , of gross profit, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 21,480, or 20.0 , of gross profit, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate on gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by higher penalties and interest due on tax payments and uncertain tax positions and the tax treatment of certain accounting reserves, which was partially offset by a benefit from an incremental impact attributable to the tax treatment of certain acquired intangible assets. Refer to Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s income taxes.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit excluding non-cash inventory costs, which include depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold, equity-based compensation included in cost of goods sold, start-up costs included in cost of goods sold, and other non-cash inventory adjustments. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of net revenue. Our Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by management that is not defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. Management calculates Adjusted EBITDA as the reported net income or loss, adjusted to exclude: income tax expense, other (income) expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold, non-cash inventory adjustments, equity-based compensation, equity-based compensation included in cost of goods sold, start-up costs, start-up costs included in cost of goods sold, transaction-related and other non-recurring expenses, and gain or loss on sale of assets. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful and useful financial information, as this measure demonstrates the operating performance of the business. Non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to the results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, U.S. GAAP results.

Also includes other one-time or non-recurring expenses, as applicable. 
 (3) Legal and professional fees associated with litigation matters, potential acquisitions, other regulatory matters, and other non-recurring expenses. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 each include a reserve of 2,083 associated with a noncurrent receivable and approximately 3,600 of expenses associated with our debt refinancing. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes: a reserve of 5,447 related to certain amounts associated with a previous transaction, 984 recognized as a discount on a noncurrent receivable, and a fair value adjustment related to an acquisition earn-out of 630. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 include a fair value adjustment related to an acquisition earn-out of 606 and 1,594, respectively, and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes a 1,804 reserve on a note receivable.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We are an emerging growth company and our primary sources of liquidity are operating cash flows, borrowings through the issuance of debt, and funds raised through the issuance of equity securities. We are generating cash from sales and deploying our capital reserves to acquire and develop assets capable of producing additional revenue and earnings over both the immediate and long term. Capital reserves are being utilized for acquisitions in the medical and adult-use cannabis markets, for capital expenditures and improvements in existing facilities, product development and marketing, as well as customer, supplier, and investor and industry relations. 
 Financing History and Future Capital Requirements 
 Historically, we have used private financing as a source of liquidity for short-term working capital needs and general corporate purposes. In May 2021, we completed an initial public offering of shares of our Class A common stock through which we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately 86,065, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and certain direct offering expenses paid by us, and in August 2021 we entered into a credit facility under which we initially borrowed a 210,000 term loan. During the second quarter of 2022, we borrowed an additional 65,000 of term loans from certain lenders under the expansion feature of the credit facility, as further described below. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2023, we raised an aggregate of 7,000 in gross proceeds through a non-brokered private placement offering of an aggregate of 9,859 shares of the Company s Class A common stock to a single investor. Most recently, in July 2024 we issued term notes in aggregate principal of 235,000, which proceeds were used, together with cash on hand, to prepay a portion of our other term loans then-outstanding, as discussed further below. 
 Our future ability to fund operations, to make planned capital expenditures, to acquire other entities or investments, to make scheduled debt payments, and to repay or refinance indebtedness depends on our future operating performance, cash flows, and ability to obtain equity or debt financing, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions, as well as financial, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total current liabilities of 145,129 and 92,686, respectively, and total current assets of 213,578 and 228,860, respectively, which includes cash and cash equivalents of 65,279 and 72,508, respectively, to meet our current obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 68,449, compared to 136,174 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Approximately 90 of our cash and cash equivalents balance as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is on deposit with banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions. We have not experienced any material impacts related to banking restrictions applicable to cannabis businesses. Our cash and cash equivalents balance is not restricted for use by VIEs. 
 As reflected in the Financial Statements, we had an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as well as a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which are indicators that raise substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of our Financial Statements has been alleviated due to: (i) cash on hand and (ii) continued growth of sales from our consolidated operations. Management plans to continue to access capital markets for additional funding through debt and/or equity financings to supplement future cash needs, as may be required. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing its business plans. If we are unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms, if at all, whenever necessary, we may be forced to decelerate or curtail certain of our operations until such time as additional capital becomes available.

Credit Facility 
 In August 2021, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders (the 2021 Credit Agreement that provided for an initial term loan of 210,000, which was borrowed in full. The 2021 Credit Agreement provided for an expansion feature that allowed us to request an increase in the term loan outstanding up to 275,000 if the existing lenders (or other lenders) agreed to provide such additional term loans. During the second quarter of 2022, we borrowed an additional 65,000 of incremental term loans through this expansion feature (the 2022 Loans and, together with the initial term loan, the 2021 Credit Facility for total borrowings of 275,000. The 2021 Credit Facility matures on August 27, 2025 and does not require scheduled principal amortization payments. Borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of 9.5 per annum, payable quarterly. The proceeds from the initial term loan under the 2021 Credit Facility were used, in part, to prepay certain then-outstanding debt obligations and, together with the 2022 Loans, fund working capital and general corporate matters, including, but not limited to, growth investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other strategic initiatives. 
 Mandatory prepayments are required following certain events, including the proceeds of indebtedness that is not permitted under the agreement, asset sales, and casualty events, subject to customary reinvestment rights. We may prepay the 2021 Credit Facility at any time, subject to a customary make-whole payment or prepayment penalty, as applicable. Once repaid, amounts borrowed under the 2021 Credit Facility may not be re-borrowed. We may request an extension of the maturity date for 364 days, which the lenders may grant at their discretion. 
 In April 2024, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to permit the Company to initiate, from time to time and at its discretion, a Dutch Auction pursuant to which it may issue a tender offer to existing lenders to re-purchase and retire their loans at a specified discount to par. No such re-purchase has occurred as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q. In June 2024, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, permit the Company to issue new senior secured notes. 
 In June 2024, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, permit the Company to issue new senior secured notes. In July 2024, the Company prepaid 215,000 of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility, primarily utilizing the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Term Notes, discussed above. The remaining 60,000 of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility will remain outstanding based on the original terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement. The Company recognized, as a component of interest expense, a loss on extinguishment of 5,475, which includes 3,527 of prepayment fees and the write-off of 1,948 of unamortized deferred financing costs that were attributable to those lenders who did not provide funding under the new notes. A total of 1,579 of prepayment fees and 1,428 of previously unamortized deferred financing costs that were associated with existing lenders who participated in the new notes will remain capitalized and will be deferred over the term of the new notes in accordance with modification treatment. The total prepayment fee is included within Debt issuance costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. A total of 943 of unamortized deferred financing costs were associated with the portion of the 2021 Credit Facility that was not prepaid and will be amortized through the remaining term of those loans. 
 We are required to comply with two financial covenants under the 2021 Credit Agreement. Liquidity (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents pledged under the 2021 Credit Facility plus any future revolving credit availability) may not be below 20,000 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and we may not permit the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement) to consolidated cash interest expense for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than 2.50:1.00.

Financing Agreement 
 In December 2022, we received 19,364 pursuant to a financing agreement with a third-party lender (the Financing Agreement ). The Company assigned to the lender its interests in the ERTC Claim that it submitted in November 2022 totaling approximately 22,794. If the Company does not receive the ERTC Claim, in whole or in part, the Company is required to repay the related portion of the funds received plus interest of 10 accrued from the date of the Financing Agreement through the repayment date. The Financing Agreement does not have a stated maturity date and the discount is being accreted to interest expense over an expected term. The Company s obligations under the Financing Agreement will be satisfied upon receipt of the ERTC Claim, in full, or other full repayment. The total claim amount of 22,794 was recognized as a component of Other, net on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Financial Statements during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. A total of 1,964 of the ERTC Claim remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which receivable is included in Other current assets on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in the Financial Statements, and the balance outstanding under the Financing Agreement is included in Current portion of debt, net.

 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 38,126 58,666 Net cash used in investing activities (30,004) (51,736) Net cash used in financing activities 
 (15,351) (17,155) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 20,540 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an impact from the timing of payments to suppliers and vendors and other working capital payments, including the payment of approximately 2,800 of expenses associated with our debt refinancing that are not capitalizable and 2,458 of fair value accretion associated with the payment of contingent consideration related to a prior acquisition. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes income tax refunds totaling approximately 17,800. Comparatively, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes the recognition of the 22,794 ERTC Claim, of which 20,830 was received during that period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 21,732 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower payments associated with acquisitions and lower net investments in notes receivable, partially offset by the absence of proceeds from the sale of assets and higher capital expenditures. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 1,804 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The current period reflects the utilization of proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Term Notes to partially prepay amounts outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility and related financing costs. Additionally, the current period was impacted by the payment of contingent consideration associated with a prior acquisition and higher cash remittances of taxes withheld under equity-based compensation plans, as well as the absence of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in the prior year period.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of long-term fixed rate debt and related interest payments, leases, finance arrangements, and amounts due for acquisitions. We believe that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures, debt services, working capital needs, and other contractual obligations for the next twelve months. 
 The following table summarizes the Company s material future contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024:

 As of the date of this filing, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on the results of our operations or financial condition, including, and without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital resources. 
 55 

Capital Expenditures 
 We anticipate capital expenditures, net of tenant improvement allowances, of approximately 10,000 to 15,000 during the remainder of 2024 related to certain expansion projects across our retail operations and at our cultivation facilities, in addition to other enhancements and general maintenance activities across our portfolio. Changes to this estimate could result from the timing of various project start dates, which are subject to local and regulatory approvals, as well as capital allocation considerations. Spending at our cultivation and processing facilities includes: construction; purchase of capital equipment such as extraction equipment, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment, and other manufacturing equipment; general maintenance; and information technology capital expenditures. Dispensary-related capital expenditures includes construction costs for the initial build-out of each location, general maintenance costs, and upgrades to existing locations. Management expects to fund capital expenditures primarily by utilizing cash flows from operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our construction in progress CIP balance was 3,329 and relates to capital spending on projects that were not yet complete. This balance includes amounts related to certain expansion projects at our Massachusetts, Illinois, and New Jersey cultivation facilities and other projects across our dispensaries and cultivation facilities.

 Loan Receivable 
 In June 2023, the Company purchased, at par, 12,027 of the principal of a loan (the Maryland Loan Receivable ), outstanding pursuant to a loan agreement with a cannabis license holder in Maryland (the Maryland Loan Agreement ), plus the associated interest receivable. The Maryland Loan Agreement had an original maturity date of August 1, 2026, required monthly repayments equal to 10.0 of the outstanding balance (including paid-in-kind interest), and could be prepaid subject to a customary make-whole payment or prepayment penalty, as applicable. Mandatory prepayments were required from the proceeds of certain events. The Maryland Loan Agreement provided for a base interest rate of 12.0 plus LIBOR (LIBOR floor of 1.0 and a paid-in-kind interest rate of 4.5 . Following the replacement of LIBOR, effective July 1, 2023, the LIBOR component of the interest rate transitioned to the secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus an alternative reference rate committee ARRC standard adjustment. 
 The Company recorded the Maryland Loan Receivable at an amortized cost basis of 12,622. A total of 595 of transaction-related expenses were capitalized as part of the amortized cost basis and were being amortized to interest income over the term. The Company identified certain events of default and covenant violations, including non-payment, and provided an acceleration notice during the second quarter of 2023 that declared all amounts due and payable. As such, during the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company established a reserve of 1,804 for potential collectability. 
 In March 2024, the borrower refinanced the borrowings underlying the Maryland Loan Agreement with a third-party lender (the Maryland Refinancing ). In conjunction with the Maryland Refinancing, the borrower s obligations to the Company under the Maryland Loan Agreement were settled. As part of this settlement, the Company received a cash payment of 8,100. Additionally, the parties entered into a supply agreement that provides for the Company to receive 6,000 of inventory products from the borrower, based on market prices, over the course of three years, with a maximum of 500 per quarter.

Legal Matters 
 MedMen NY Litigation 
 On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive investment agreement (the Investment Agreement with subsidiaries of MedMen Enterprises Inc. MedMen ), under which we would have, subject to regulatory approval, completed an investment (the Investment of approximately 73,000 in MedMen NY, Inc. MMNY ), a licensed medical cannabis operator in the state of New York. Following the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement, we were expected to hold all the outstanding equity of MMNY. Specifically, the Investment Agreement provided that at closing, the Company was going to pay to MedMen s senior lenders 35,000, less certain transaction costs and a prepaid deposit of 4,000, and AWH New York, LLC was going to issue a senior secured promissory note in favor of MMNY s senior secured lender in the principal amount of 28,000, guaranteed by AWH, which cash investment and note would be used to reduce the amounts owed to MMNY s senior secured lender. Following its investment, AWH would hold a controlling interest in MMNY equal to approximately 86.7 of the equity in MMNY, and be provided with an option to acquire MedMen s remaining interest in MMNY in the future for a nominal additional payment, which option the Company intended to exercise. The Investment Agreement also required AWH to make an additional investment of 10,000 in MMNY, which investment would also be used to repay MMNY s senior secured lender, if adult-use cannabis sales commenced in MMNY s dispensaries. 
 The Company contends that, in December 2021, the parties to the Investment Agreement received the required approvals from the State of New York to close the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement, but MedMen has disputed the adequacy of the approvals provided by the State of New York. The Company delivered notice to MedMen in December 2021 that it wished to close the transactions as required by the Investment Agreement. Nevertheless, MedMen, on January 2, 2022, gave notice to the Company that MedMen purported to terminate the Investment Agreement. 
 Following receipt of such notice, on January 13, 2022, the Company filed a complaint against MedMen and others in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York (the Court ), requesting specific performance that the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement must move forward, and such other relief as the Court may deem appropriate. The Company simultaneously moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction (the Motion requiring MedMen to operate its New York business in the ordinary course of business and to refrain from any activities or transactions that might impair, encumber, or dissipate MedMen s New York assets. The parties resolved the Motion via a Stipulation and Order entered by the Court on January 21, 2022 that required that MMNY operate only in compliance with the law and in a manner consistent with its ordinary course of business that preserved all assets of MMNY. It further required MMNY to not take certain actions, including any actions that would have a material adverse effect on MedMen s New York business. On March 27, 2023, the parties entered a further stipulation that modified the January 21, 2022 Stipulation and Order by lifting the Court s prohibition against a sale or transfer of MMNY or its assets, without waiver of any claims that the Company might have in the event of such a transaction. That further stipulation modifying the January 21, 2022 Stipulation and Order was entered by the Court on August 1, 2023. 
 On January 24, 2022, MedMen filed counterclaims against the Company, alleging that Ascend had breached the Investment Agreement, and seeking declaratory relief that MedMen had properly terminated the Investment Agreement. On February 14, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss MedMen s counterclaims and filed an amended complaint (the First Amended Complaint that included additional claims against MedMen for breach of contract. The First Amended Complaint contained several causes of action, including for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The First Amended Complaint sought damages in addition to continuing to seek injunctive and declaratory relief. On March 7, 2022, MedMen filed amended counterclaims, an answer, and affirmative defenses to the First Amended Complaint. On March 28, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss MedMen s amended counterclaims. On April 20, 2022, the parties entered into a stipulation extending the 
 58 

time for MedMen to oppose the Company s motion to dismiss until May 5, 2022. In addition, the parties agreed to stay all discovery, including both party and non-party discovery. On May 5, 2022, the parties filed another stipulation order with the Court adjourning until further notice from the Court MedMen s time to oppose the Company s motion to dismiss MedMen s amended counterclaims. The parties again stipulated that all discovery remains stayed pending further order from the Court. 
 On May 10, 2022, the Company and MedMen signed a term sheet (the Term Sheet ), pursuant to which the parties agreed to use best efforts to enter into a settlement agreement and enter into new or amended transactional documents. Specifically, if consummated, the agreements contemplated by the Term Sheet would have entailed, among other things, the Company paying MedMen 15,000 in additional transaction consideration, and MedMen withdrawing its counterclaims against the Company. Per the amended transaction terms contemplated in the Term Sheet, upon closing, the Company would have received a 99.99 controlling interest in MMNY and the Company would have paid MedMen 74,000, which reflected the original transaction consideration plus an additional 11,000 per the parties Term Sheet, less a 4,000 deposit that the Company already paid. 
 The amended transaction terms contemplated in the Term Sheet also would have required MedMen to provide a representation and warranty that the status of the MMNY assets had not materially changed since December 31, 2021 and an acknowledgement that the representations and warranties from the Investment Agreement would survive for three months after the closing of the contemplated transactions. However, after the Company determined that MedMen could not make or provide the representations and warranties that MedMen would have been required to make as part of the contemplated transactions, the Company determined that it no longer intended to consummate the contemplated transactions. 
 On September 30, 2022, the Company sought leave from the Court to file a second amended complaint (the Second Amended Complaint ). The Second Amended Complaint contains breach of contract claims against MedMen, as well as a claim for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and a claim for anticipatory breach of contract. In connection with those claims, the Company is no longer seeking injunctive or declaratory relief; however, the Company continues to seek damages from MedMen, including, but not limited to, the return of the 4,000 deposit, approximately 2,400 of advances pursuant to a working capital loan agreement (as described in Note 6, Notes Receivable and other capital expenditure advances paid to MMNY by the Company. 
 On November 21, 2022, the parties entered into a stipulation whereby MedMen agreed to the filing of the Second Amended Complaint, which is now the Company s operative pleading in the litigation. In addition, in the stipulation, the Company agreed that it would not contest MedMen s filing of second amended counterclaims against the Company while reserving all rights with respect to any such counterclaims. Because the parties agreed to the filing of each side s amended pleadings, on November 28, 2022, the Court determined that Ascend s March 2022 motion to dismiss was moot. 
 On December 21, 2022, MedMen filed its second amended counterclaims, an answer, and affirmative defenses to the Company s Second Amended Complaint. In addition to the allegations in MedMen s earlier pleadings, MedMen now also alleged that the Company breached the Term Sheet. On January 20, 2023, the Company moved to dismiss MedMen s second amended counterclaims. 
 On August 18, 2023, the Court issued a Decision and Order on the Company s motion to dismiss, dismissing seven of MedMen s ten counterclaims, including each of the counterclaims brought by MedMen relating to the Term Sheet. On September 26, 2023, MedMen filed a motion seeking leave to file its third amended counterclaims, in which MedMen seeks to revive its previously dismissed counterclaims relating to the Term Sheet. On October 24, 2023, the Company filed an opposition to that motion for leave. As further discussed below, the Court denied that motion on February 2, 2024. In addition, on October 18, 2023, MedMen filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court s August 18, 2023 Decision and Order with respect to the dismissal of MedMen s three counterclaims relating to the Term Sheet. On November 1, 2023 the Company filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal with respect to the Court s determination that the Company s motion to dismiss was not subject to New York s anti-SLAPP statute. Both parties have yet to perfect the appeals. 
 59 

On February 2, 2024, the Court issued a Decision and Order denying MedMen s motion for leave to file its third amended counterclaims. 
 On February 21, 2024, the current counsel-of-record for MedMen filed an order to show cause with the Court seeking leave to withdraw as counsel and stay proceedings for thirty days to permit MedMen time to obtain new counsel. On March 20, 2024, the Court granted such withdrawal motion and appointed April 25, 2024 as the deadline for MedMen to obtain new counsel, which, as of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, had not occurred. 
 On April 26, 2024, MedMen announced that it made an assignment into bankruptcy pursuant to Canada s Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act on April 24, 2024 and B. Riley Farber Inc. was appointed as its bankruptcy trustee. In addition, MedMen announced that MedMen s wholly owned subsidiary, MM CAN USA, Inc., a California corporation, was placed into receivership in the Los Angeles Superior Court, Santa Monica Division on April 23, 2024 to effectuate an orderly dissolution and liquidation of its California-based assets. MedMen further announced that it intends to initiate additional receivership proceedings in those U.S. states where MM CAN USA, Inc. controls or owns assets, through which the operations and assets of MedMen s subsidiaries will be dissolved or liquidated pursuant to applicable laws in the United States. On May 21, 2024, the Los Angeles Superior Court issued an order confirming the appointment a receiver for MM CAN USA, Inc. The receiver has submitted monthly reports to the Los Angeles Superior Court estimating that the liabilities of MedMen s subsidiaries likely significantly exceed the estimated liquidated value of MedMen's subsidiaries and their respective assets, and such reports indicate that efforts to dissolve, liquidate, or abandon such assets are ongoing. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, following the Company s decision to no longer consummate the contemplated transactions, the Company established an estimated reserve of 3,700 related to the amounts that it has been actively pursuing collecting. The estimated reserve as of December 31, 2023 is included within Other current assets on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Financial Statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company increased the estimated reserve by 5,447, which is included within General and administrative expenses on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and within Other on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total reserve as of September 30, 2024 is reflective of all outstanding balances and of which 2,422 is included within Notes receivable on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, 6,695 is included within Other current assets, and the remainder is included within Other noncurrent assets. 
 Other Matter 
 In April 2021, the Company, through a subsidiary, entered into a settlement agreement with TVP, LLC, TVP Grand Rapids, LLC and, TVP Alma, LLC (collectively, the TVP Parties regarding a dispute related to a purchase agreement for the Company s potential acquisition of certain real estate properties in Michigan. As part of that settlement, the Company issued historical equity units to the TVP Parties to be held in the name of an escrow agent (the Escrow Units ). The Escrow Units were fully issued and outstanding as of the settlement date and were to remain in the escrow account until such time as the TVP Parties exercised an option to hold the Escrow Units directly (the Put Option ), which could be exercised for three years. In February 2024, the TVP Parties notified the Company that they were exercising the Put Option and the transfer was completed in May 2024, at which time the Escrow Units were released to the TVP Parties and the TVP Parties transferred to the Company the equity interests of the entities that hold three real estate properties. The underlying properties were determined to have a total fair value of 5,400 as of the settlement date, which was included within Other noncurrent assets on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023 and was reclassified to Property and equipment, net as of the transfer date. Prior to the completion of the transfer, the Company operated dispensaries at these locations pursuant to lease agreements, which operations will continue at the now-owned properties.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our accompanying Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make certain estimates in the application of our accounting policies based on the best assumptions, judgments, and opinions of our management. The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, in the Financial Statements. For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Item 7., Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates, except as disclosed in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, in the Financial Statements. 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information about recently issued accounting standards that have not yet been adopted, see Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the Financial Statements. 
 The Company is an emerging growth company under federal securities laws and as such we are able to elect to follow scaled disclosure requirements for this filing, including an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. 
 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT: ISSUERS WITH UNITED STATES CANNABIS-RELATED ASSETS 
 In accordance with the Canadian Securities Administration Staff Notice 51-352, information regarding the current federal and state-level United States regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we are currently directly and indirectly involved in the cannabis industry, through our subsidiaries and investments, is incorporated by reference from subsections Overview of Government Regulation, Compliance with Applicable State Laws in the United States, and State Regulation of Cannabis, under Item 1., Business, of the Company s Annual Report, as filed with the SEC and with the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities under its profile on SEDAR+. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We are exposed in varying degrees to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, prices of raw materials, and other financial instrument related risks. There have been no material changes in our market risks from those disclosed in Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations associated with financial liabilities. We manage liquidity risk through the effective management of our capital structure. Our approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity at all times to settle obligations and liabilities when due. 
 As reflected in the Financial Statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as well as a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which are indicators that raise substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of our Financial Statements has been alleviated due to: (i) cash on hand and (ii) continued growth of sales from our consolidated operations. Management plans to continue to access capital markets for additional funding through debt and/or equity financings to supplement future cash needs, as may be required. However, management cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in accomplishing our business plans. If we are unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms, if at all, whenever necessary, we may be forced to decelerate or curtail certain of our operations until such time as additional capital becomes available. 
 61 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 b. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 62 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 A discussion of our litigation matters occurring in the period covered by this report is found in Note 15 , Commitments and Contingencies, to the Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Other than as set forth below, as of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in response to Item 1A., Risk Factors, of Part I of the Annual Report. 
 We face risks related to U.S. tax provisions related to controlled substances. 
 Limits on U.S. deductibility of certain expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Section 280E Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, prohibits businesses from deducting certain expenses associated with the trafficking of controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811) (the CSA )). The Internal Revenue Service IRS has applied Section 280E broadly in tax audits against various cannabis businesses in the U.S. that are permitted under applicable state laws, seeking substantial sums in tax liabilities, interest, and penalties resulting from the underpayment of taxes due to the lack of deductibility of otherwise ordinary business expenses the deduction of which is prohibited by Section 280E. Although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of certain expenses that can be categorized as cost of goods sold, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted. While there are currently several pending cases before various administrative and federal courts challenging these restrictions, there is no guarantee that these courts will issue an interpretation of Section 280E that is favorable to cannabis businesses. 
 The Company has filed amended tax returns with the IRS on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries claiming refunds of tax for 2020 and 2021 and a refund and/or reduction of tax for 2022 which had been incurred as a result of the application of Section 280E based on a legal interpretation that Section 280E does not apply to solely intrastate cannabis-related business activities. The Company intends to continue to take this position for the 2023 filing year. There is no guarantee that the IRS will not challenge our refund request and prevail in such challenge. 
 If our tax filing positions were to be challenged by federal, state and local or foreign tax jurisdictions, we may not be wholly successful in defending our tax filing positions. We record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. We, therefore, analyze and consider the appropriateness of recording reserves for unrecognized tax benefits each quarter. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which result could be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. 
 On May 21, 2024, the United States Department of Justice published a notice of proposed rulemaking with the Federal Register to initiate a formal rulemaking process to consider rescheduling cannabis under the CSA. In June 2024, the IRS issued a press release stating that, until a final rule is published, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance and is subject to the limitations of Section 280E. In this press release, the IRS also announced that taxpayers seeking a refund of taxes paid related to Section 280E by filing amended returns are not entitled to a refund or payment and that it is taking steps to address these claims. From time to time, the Company receives notices from various local, state, and federal tax agencies in the normal course of business. The Company is currently engaged with certain state and federal departments of revenue in respect to certain of the Company s income tax returns that have been selected for examination.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.

 Not applicable.

 Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers

The parties further agree that, in the event that any provision of the Restrictive Covenants shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities or otherwise, such provision shall be deemed to be modified by the court to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
 k. Notification of New Employer . In the event that the Executive is employed or otherwise engaged by any other person or entity following the Termination Date, the Executive agrees to notify, and consents to the notification by Company and its affiliates of, such person or entity of the Restrictive Covenants. 
 8. Excise Tax . 
 a. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise, to the extent that any payment, distribution or acceleration of vesting to or for the benefit of Executive by the Company (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder), whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the Total Payments ), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below) if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in Executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax), than if Executive received the entire amount of such Total Payments in accordance with their existing terms (taking into account federal, state, and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax). For purposes of this Agreement, the term Safe Harbor Amount means the largest portion of the Total Payments that would result in no portion of the Total Payments being subject to the Excise Tax. To effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which are payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating non-cash payments, in each case, starting with the payments to be made farthest in time from the Determination (as defined below). 
 b. The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in Section 8(a) and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company s expense by an accounting firm selected by Company from among the 10 largest accounting firms in the United States or by qualified independent tax counsel (the Determining Party provided, that Executive shall be given advance notice of the Determining Party selected by the Company, and 
 -14- 

shall have the opportunity to reject the selection, within two business days of being notified of the selection, on the basis of that Determining Party s having a conflict of interest or other reasonable basis, in which case the Company shall select an alternative firm among the 10 largest accounting firms in the United States or alternative independent qualified tax counsel, which shall become the Determining Party. Such Determining Party shall provide its determination (the Determination ), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and Executive, within 10 business days of the termination of Executive s employment or at such other time mutually agreed by the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive with respect to the Total Payments, it shall furnish Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such payments and, absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that an Excise Tax would be payable, the Company shall have the right to accept the Determination as to the extent of the reduction, if any, pursuant to Section 8(a), or to have such Determination reviewed by another accounting firm selected by the Company, at the Company s expense. If the two accounting firms do not agree, a third accounting firm shall be jointly chosen by Executive and the Company, in which case the determination of such third accounting firm shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. 
 c. If, notwithstanding any reduction described in this Section 8, the Internal Revenue Service IRS determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of any of the Total Payments or otherwise, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within 30 calendar days after a final IRS determination or in the event that Executive challenges the final IRS determination, a final judicial determination, a portion of the Total Payments equal to the Repayment Amount . The Repayment Amount with respect to the payment of benefits shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that Executive s net after- tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed on the Total Payments) shall be maximized. The Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments being maximized. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 8, Executive shall pay the Excise Tax. 
 d. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, if (i) there is a reduction in the Total Payments as described in this Section 8, (ii) the IRS later determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of Executive s net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if Executive s benefits had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to Executive those payments or benefits which were reduced pursuant to this Section 8 as soon as administratively possible after Executive pays the Excise Tax (but not later than March 15 following the calendar year of the IRS determination) so that Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments are maximized. 
 e. If, following a reduction of the Total Payments pursuant to Section 8(a), the Determining Party or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Total Payments were reduced to a greater extent than required under Section 8, then the Company shall as soon as administratively possible (but not later than by March 15 following the calendar year of such determination) pay the amount of such excess reduction to or for the benefit of Executive, together with interest at the applicable federal rate (as defined in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code), from the date the amount would have otherwise been paid to Executive until the payment date. 
 -15- 

f. To the extent requested by Executive, the Company shall cooperate with Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Determining Party shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by Executive (including, without limitation, Executive s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant, before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q&A-2(b) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q&A-9 and Q&A-40 to Q&A- 44 of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code and or exempt from the definition of the term parachute payment within the meaning of Q&A-2(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q&A- 5(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code. 
 9. Conflicting Agreements . The Executive hereby represents and warrants that the execution of this Agreement and the performance of his obligations hereunder will not breach or be in conflict with any other agreement to which the Executive is a party or is bound and that the Executive is not now subject to any covenants against competition or similar covenants or any court order or other legal obligation that would affect the performance of his obligations hereunder, any and all of which are superseded by this Agreement. The Executive will not disclose to or use on behalf of the Company any proprietary information of a third party without such party s consent. 
 10. Indemnification . The Company shall indemnify the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and the Executive, and their respective successors, executors, administrators, heirs and permitted assigns. 
 13. Severability . If any portion or provision of this Agreement shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such portion or provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
 14. Amendment and Waiver . This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by the Executive and the Company. No waiver of any provision hereof shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the waiving party. The failure of either party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement, shall not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach. No waiver by either of the parties of any breach by the other party hereto of any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by the other party hereto shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time.

 c. Provisions of this Agreement shall survive any termination of Executive s employment hereunder if so provided herein or if necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of other surviving provisions, including without limitation the Restrictive Covenants (as defined below). The obligation of the Company to make payments and provide benefits to or on behalf of the Executive under 5(b), 5(d), 5(e) or 5(f) hereof (other than the Final Compensation) is expressly conditioned upon the Executive s continued compliance with the Restrictive Covenants provided that (i) the Company may not discontinue any such payments and benefits (or require repayment of any such payments or benefits already provided to the Executive) unless the Company has provided written notice to the Executive setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of such non-compliance and, if the nature of such non-compliance is such that it is capable of being remedied by the Executive without any damage to the Company, as determined by the Board, the Executive shall have failed to remedy such non-compliance within ten (10) days following receipt of such notice (it being understood that if the nature of such non-compliance is such that it is not capable of being remedied by the Executive without any damage to the Company, as determined by the Board, the Company may discontinue such payments and benefits at such time as it provides such written notice to the Executive) and (ii) to the extent curable, the Company may suspend or discontinue such payments or benefits thereafter only during such period as such non-compliance continues. The Executive recognizes that, except as expressly provided in Section 5, no compensation is earned after termination of employment.

The Company and the Executive agree that the Restrictive Covenants are essential and narrowly tailored to preserve the goodwill of the business of the Company and its affiliates, to maintain the confidential and trade secret information of the Company and its affiliates, and to protect other legitimate business interests of the Company and its affiliates in light of their niche businesses and the executive position held by the Executive. The Company and the Executive further agree that the Company would not have entered into this Agreement without the Executive s agreement to the Restrictive Covenants.

For purposes of clarification, and not limitation, a statement shall be deemed to disparage, denigrate or malign a person or entity if such statement could be reasonably construed to adversely affect the opinion any other person or entity may have or form of such first person or entity. No obligation under this Section 7(d) shall be violated by truthful statements (x) made to any governmental authority, (y) which are in connection with legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (z) made in performance reviews.

Nothing in this Section 7(e) or in this Agreement prohibits the Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law or regulation. Further, in accordance with the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, (I) the Executive shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal, and (II) if the Executive files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, the Executive may disclose a trade secret to his attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the Executive files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret except pursuant to court order. In the event that the Executive becomes legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, request for information or documents, subpoena, criminal or civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, then prior to such disclosure, the Executive will provide the Board with prompt written notice so that the Company may seek (with the Executive s cooperation) a protective order or other appropriate remedy and or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, then the Executive will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required (as may be advised by Executive s legal counsel), and will cooperate with the Company in the Company s efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information. In addition, the Executive shall not create any derivative work or other product based on or resulting from any Confidential Information (except in the good faith performance of the Executive s duties under this Agreement while employed by the Company). The Executive shall also proffer to the Board s designee, no later than the Termination Date (or upon the earlier request of the Company), and without retaining any copies, notes or excerpts thereof, all property of the Company and its affiliates in whatever form, including, without limitation, memoranda, computer disks or other media, computer programs, diaries, notes, records, data, customer or client lists, marketing plans and strategies, and any other documents consisting of or containing Confidential Information, that are in the Executive s actual or constructive possession or which are subject to the Executive s control at such time. To the extent the Executive has retained any such property or Confidential Information on any electronic or computer equipment belonging to the Executive or under the Executive s control, the Executive agrees to so advise Company and to follow Company s instructions in permanently deleting all such property or Confidential Information and all copies. For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information shall mean all information of a sensitive, confidential or proprietary nature respecting the business and activities of the Company or any of its affiliates, including, without limitation, the terms and provisions of this Agreement (except for the terms and provisions of Section 7), and the clients, customers, suppliers, computer or other files, projects, products, computer disks or other media, computer hardware or computer software programs, marketing plans, financial information, methodologies, Inventions (as defined below), know-how, research, developments, processes, practices, approaches, projections, forecasts, formats, systems, data gathering methods and or strategies of the Company or any of its affiliates.

 -9- 

Executive has knowledge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include any information that is generally available, or is made generally available, to the public other than as a result of a direct or indirect unauthorized disclosure by the Executive or any other person or entity subject to a confidentiality obligation. 
 f. Ownership of Inventions . The Executive acknowledges and agrees that all Company Inventions (as defined below) (including all intellectual property rights arising therein or thereto, all rights of priority relating to patents, and all claims for past, present and future infringement, misappropriation relating thereto), and all Confidential Information, hereby are and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company (collectively, the Company IP ). For consideration acknowledged and received, the Executive hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys and sets over to the Company all of the Executive s right, title and interest in and to all Company IP. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the compensation received by the Executive for employment or services provided to the Company is adequate consideration for the foregoing assignment. The Executive further agrees to disclose in writing to the Board any Company Inventions promptly following their conception or reduction to practice. Such disclosure shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail and appropriately illustrated by sketch or diagram to convey to one skilled in the art of which the Company Invention pertains, a clear understanding of the nature, purpose, operations, and other characteristics of the Company Invention. The Executive agrees to execute and deliver such deeds of assignment or other documents of conveyance and transfer as the Company may request to confirm in the Company or its designee the ownership of the Company Inventions, without compensation beyond that provided in this Agreement. The Executive further agrees, upon the request of the Company and at its expense, that the Executive will execute any other instrument and document necessary or desirable in applying for and obtaining patents in the United States and in any foreign country with respect to any Company Invention. The Executive further agrees, whether or not the Executive is then an employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its affiliates, upon request of the Company, to provide reasonable assistance with respect to the perfection, recordation or other documentation of the assignment of Company IP hereunder, and the enforcement of the Company s rights in any Company IP, and to cooperate to the extent and in the manner reasonably requested by the Company in any litigation or other claim or proceeding (including, without limitation, the prosecution or defense of any claim involving a patent) involving any Company IP covered by this Agreement, without further compensation, but all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Executive in satisfying the requirements of this Section 7(f) shall be paid by the Company or its designee.

For purposes of this Agreement, Invention shall mean any invention, formula, therapy, diagnostic technique, discovery, improvement, idea, technique, design, method, art, process, methodology, algorithm, machine, development, product,

service, technology, strategy, software, work of authorship or other Works (as defined below), trade secret, innovation, trademark, data, database, or the like, whether or not patentable, together with all intellectual property rights therein. 
 g. Works for Hire . The Executive also acknowledges and agrees that all works of authorship, in any format or medium, and whether published or unpublished, created wholly or in part by the Executive, whether alone or jointly with others, (i) in the course of, in connection with, or as a result of the Executive s employment or other service with the Company or any of its affiliates (whether before, on, or after the Commencement Date), (ii) at the direction or request of the Company or any of its affiliates (whether before, on, or after the Commencement Date), or (iii) through the use of, or that is related to, facilities, equipment, Confidential Information, other Company Inventions, intellectual property or other resources of the Company or any of its affiliates, whether or not during the Executive s work hours (and whether before, on, or after the Effective Date) Works ), are works made for hire as defined under United States copyright law, and that the Works (and all copyrights arising in the Works) are owned exclusively by the Company and all rights therein will automatically vest in the Company without the need for any further action by any party. To the extent any such Works are not deemed to be works made for hire, for consideration acknowledged and received, the Executive hereby waives any moral rights in such Works and the Executive hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, conveys and sets over to the Company or its designee, without compensation beyond that provided in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to such Works, including without limitation all rights of copyright arising therein or thereto, and further agrees to execute such assignments or other deeds of conveyance and transfer as the Company may request to vest in the Company or its designee all right, title and interest in and to such Works, including all rights of copyright arising in or related to the Works. 
 h. Cooperation . During and after the term hereof, the Executive agrees to cooperate with the Company and its affiliates in any internal investigation, any administrative, regulatory, or judicial proceeding or any dispute with a third-party concerning issues about which the Executive has knowledge or that may relate to the Executive or the Executive s employment or service with the Company or any of its affiliates (or the termination thereof). The Executive s obligation to cooperate hereunder includes, without limitation, being available to the Company and its affiliates upon reasonable notice for interviews and factual investigations, appearing in any forum at the Company s or any of its affiliates reasonable request to give testimony (without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process), volunteering to the Company and its affiliates pertinent information, and turning over to the Company and its affiliates all relevant documents which are or may come into the Executive s possession. The Company shall promptly reimburse the Executive for the reasonable pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with such cooperation. For the avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding sentence shall not require the Company to reimburse the Executive for any attorneys fees or related costs the Executive may incur absent advance written approval by the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
 i. Notification Requirement . Until the expiration of the period or periods for Restrictive Covenants (as applicable), the Executive shall, upon a reasonable request by the Company, give notice to the Company of any new business activity in which he is engaged. Such notice shall state the name and address of the individual, corporation, limited liability company, association, partnership, estate, trust and other entity or organization, other than the Company or any of its affiliates (any such individual or entity being hereinafter referred to as a Person for whom such activity is undertaken and the nature of the Executive s business relationship(s) and position(s) with such Person. The Executive shall provide the Company with such other pertinent information concerning such business activity as the Company may 
 -11- 

reasonably request in order to determine the Executive s continued compliance with the Restrictive Covenants. 
 j. Enforcement of Covenants . The Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Restrictive Covenants. The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its affiliates and that each and every one of the Restrictive Covenants is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area, and otherwise. The Executive agrees that the Company and its affiliates, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to them, shall be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any of the Restrictive Covenants, without having to post bond, and to seek specific performance of each of the terms thereof. The Restrictive Covenants are intended for the benefit of the Company and each of its affiliates. Each affiliate of the Company is an intended third-party beneficiary of the Restrictive Covenants, and each affiliate of the Company, as well as any successor or assign of the Company or such affiliate, may enforce the Restrictive Covenants. The parties further agree that, in the event that any provision of the Restrictive Covenants shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities or otherwise, such provision shall be deemed to be modified by the court to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
 k. Notification of New Employer . In the event that the Executive is employed or otherwise engaged by any other person or entity following the Termination Date, the Executive agrees to notify, and consents to the notification by Company and its affiliates of, such person or entity of the Restrictive Covenants. 
 8. Excise Tax . 
 a. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise, to the extent that any payment, distribution or acceleration of vesting to or for the benefit of Executive by the Company (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder), whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the Total Payments ), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below) if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in Executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax), than if Executive received the entire amount of such Total Payments in accordance with their existing terms (taking into account federal, state, and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax). For purposes of this Agreement, the term Safe Harbor Amount means the largest portion of the Total Payments that would result in no portion of the Total Payments being subject to the Excise Tax. To effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which are payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating non-cash payments, in each case, starting with the payments to be made farthest in time from the Determination (as defined below). 
 b. The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in Section 8(a) and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company s expense by an accounting firm selected by Company from among the 10 largest accounting firms in the United States or by qualified independent tax counsel (the Determining Party provided, that Executive shall be given advance notice of the Determining Party selected by the Company, and shall have the opportunity to reject the selection, within two business days of being notified of the selection, on the basis of that Determining Party s having a conflict of interest or other reasonable basis, in which case the Company shall select an alternative firm among the 10 largest accounting firms in the United States or alternative independent qualified tax counsel, which shall become the Determining Party. Such Determining Party shall provide its determination (the 
 -12- 

Determination ), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and Executive, within 10 business days of the termination of Executive s employment or at such other time mutually agreed by the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive with respect to the Total Payments, it shall furnish Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such payments and, absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that an Excise Tax would be payable, the Company shall have the right to accept the Determination as to the extent of the reduction, if any, pursuant to Section 8(a), or to have such Determination reviewed by another accounting firm selected by the Company, at the Company s expense. If the two accounting firms do not agree, a third accounting firm shall be jointly chosen by Executive and the Company, in which case the determination of such third accounting firm shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. 
 c. If, notwithstanding any reduction described in this Section 8, the Internal Revenue Service IRS determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of any of the Total Payments or otherwise, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within 30 calendar days after a final IRS determination or in the event that Executive challenges the final IRS determination, a final judicial determination, a portion of the Total Payments equal to the Repayment Amount . The Repayment Amount with respect to the payment of benefits shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that Executive s net after- tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed on the Total Payments) shall be maximized. The Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments being maximized. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 8, Executive shall pay the Excise Tax. 
 d. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, if (i) there is a reduction in the Total Payments as described in this Section 8, (ii) the IRS later determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of Executive s net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if Executive s benefits had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to Executive those payments or benefits which were reduced pursuant to this Section 8 as soon as administratively possible after Executive pays the Excise Tax (but not later than March 15 following the calendar year of the IRS determination) so that Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments are maximized. 
 e.

The Company and the Executive agree that the Restrictive Covenants are essential and narrowly tailored to preserve the goodwill of the business of the Company and its affiliates, to maintain the confidential and trade secret information of the Company and its affiliates, and to protect other legitimate business interests of the Company and its affiliates in light of their niche businesses and the executive position held by the Executive. The Company and the Executive further agree that the Company would not have entered into this Agreement without the Executive s agreement to the Restrictive Covenants. For purposes of the Restrictive Covenants, each reference to Company and affiliate shall also refer to the predecessors and successors of the Company and any of its affiliates (as the case may be). 
 a. Customer Non-Solicitation . During the period commencing on the Commencement Date and ending on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Termination Date, regardless of the reason for the Executive s termination of employment and regardless of who initiates such termination, the Executive shall not (except on the Company s behalf during the term hereof), for purposes of providing products or services that are competitive with those provided by the Company or any of its affiliates, directly or 
 -7- 

indirectly, on the Executive s own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity, contact, solicit, divert, induce, call on, take away, or do business with (or attempt to do any of the foregoing) any customer or client of the Company or any of its affiliates (or any person or entity who, during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date, was engaged in mutual contact, discussion or correspondence with the Company in respect of becoming a customer or client of the Company or any of its affiliates) with whom the Executive had contact within the twelve (12) months immediately prior to the Termination Date.

 c. Non-Competition. During the period commencing on the Commencement Date and ending on the date that is six (6) months after the Termination Date, regardless of the reason for the Executive s termination of employment and regardless of who initiates such termination (such period, the Non-Competition Period ), the Executive shall not, anywhere in the United States or in any other country or jurisdiction in which the Company or any of its affiliates conducts or conducted business during the Non-Competition Period, either directly or indirectly, as a proprietor, partner, stockholder, director, executive, employee, consultant, joint venturer, member, investor, lender or otherwise, engage or assist others to engage in, or own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or become employed or engaged by any person or entity that (i) is engaged in the business of the cultivation, manufacture and or sale of cannabis or (ii) is, or has taken steps to become, competitive with the current business, activities, products or services of the type conducted, authorized, offered, or provided by the Company or any of its affiliates, or with respect to prospective business, activities, products or services which the Company or any of its affiliates (with the Executive s knowledge or involvement) has spent significant time or resources analyzing for the purposes of assessing expansion opportunities by the Company or any of its affiliates during the twelve (12) month period immediately prior to the Termination Date, in each case except as otherwise approved by the Board at any time prior to the Termination Date (the Competitive Business ). 
 d. Non-Disparagement . During the term hereof and at all times thereafter, (I) the Executive shall not, directly or through any other person or entity, make any public or private statements (whether orally, in writing, via electronic transmission, or otherwise) that disparage, denigrate or malign (i) the Company or any of its affiliates, (ii) any of the businesses, activities, operations, affairs, reputations or prospects of the Company or any of its affiliates, or (iii) any of the officers, employees, directors, managers, partners (general and limited), agents, members or shareholders of any of the persons or entities described in any of clauses (i) or (ii) and (II) none of the members of the Board shall, and the Company shall not instruct any of its employees or employees of any of its affiliates to, directly or through any other person or entity, make any public or private statements (whether orally, in writing, via electronic transmission, or otherwise) that disparage, denigrate or malign the Executive. For purposes of clarification, and not limitation, a statement shall be deemed to disparage, denigrate or malign a person or entity if such statement could be reasonably construed to adversely affect the opinion any other person or entity may have or form of such first person or entity. No obligation under this Section 7(d) shall be violated by truthful statements (x) made to any governmental authority, (y) 
 -8- 

which are in connection with legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (z) made in performance reviews. 
 e. Confidentiality Return of Property . During the term hereof and at all times thereafter, the Executive shall not, without the prior express written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, use on the Executive s behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity, or divulge, disclose or make available or accessible to any person or entity, any Confidential Information (as defined below), other than when required to do so in good faith to perform the Executive s duties and responsibilities hereunder while employed by the Company, or when required to do so by a lawful order of a court of competent jurisdiction, any governmental authority or agency, or any recognized subpoena power. Nothing in this Section 7(e) or in this Agreement prohibits the Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable law or regulation. Further, in accordance with the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, (I) the Executive shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal, and (II) if the Executive files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, the Executive may disclose a trade secret to his attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the Executive files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret except pursuant to court order. In the event that the Executive becomes legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, request for information or documents, subpoena, criminal or civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, then prior to such disclosure, the Executive will provide the Board with prompt written notice so that the Company may seek (with the Executive s cooperation) a protective order or other appropriate remedy and or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, then the Executive will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required (as may be advised by Executive s legal counsel), and will cooperate with the Company in the Company s efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information. In addition, the Executive shall not create any derivative work or other product based on or resulting from any Confidential Information (except in the good faith performance of the Executive s duties under this Agreement while employed by the Company). The Executive shall also proffer to the Board s designee, no later than the Termination Date (or upon the earlier request of the Company), and without retaining any copies, notes or excerpts thereof, all property of the Company and its affiliates in whatever form, including, without limitation, memoranda, computer disks or other media, computer programs, diaries, notes, records, data, customer or client lists, marketing plans and strategies, and any other documents consisting of or containing Confidential Information, that are in the Executive s actual or constructive possession or which are subject to the Executive s control at such time. To the extent the Executive has retained any such property or Confidential Information on any electronic or computer equipment belonging to the Executive or under the Executive s control, the Executive agrees to so advise Company and to follow Company s instructions in permanently deleting all such property or Confidential Information and all copies. For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information shall mean all information of a sensitive, confidential or proprietary nature respecting the business and activities of the Company or any of its affiliates, including, without limitation, the terms and provisions of this Agreement (except for the terms and provisions of Section 7), and the clients, customers, suppliers, computer or other files, projects, products, computer disks or other media, computer hardware or computer software programs, marketing plans, financial information, methodologies, Inventions (as defined below), know-how, research, developments, processes, practices, approaches, projections, forecasts, formats, systems, data gathering 
 -9- 

methods and or strategies of the Company or any of its affiliates. Confidential Information also includes all information received by the Company or any of its affiliates under an obligation of confidentiality to a third party of which the Executive has knowledge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include any information that is generally available, or is made generally available, to the public other than as a result of a direct or indirect unauthorized disclosure by the Executive or any other person or entity subject to a confidentiality obligation. 
 f. Ownership of Inventions . The Executive acknowledges and agrees that all Company Inventions (as defined below) (including all intellectual property rights arising therein or thereto, all rights of priority relating to patents, and all claims for past, present and future infringement, misappropriation relating thereto), and all Confidential Information, hereby are and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company (collectively, the Company IP ). For consideration acknowledged and received, the Executive hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys and sets over to the Company all of the Executive s right, title and interest in and to all Company IP. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the compensation received by the Executive for employment or services provided to the Company is adequate consideration for the foregoing assignment. The Executive further agrees to disclose in writing to the Board any Company Inventions promptly following their conception or reduction to practice. Such disclosure shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail and appropriately illustrated by sketch or diagram to convey to one skilled in the art of which the Company Invention pertains, a clear understanding of the nature, purpose, operations, and other characteristics of the Company Invention. The Executive agrees to execute and deliver such deeds of assignment or other documents of conveyance and transfer as the Company may request to confirm in the Company or its designee the ownership of the Company Inventions, without compensation beyond that provided in this Agreement. The Executive further agrees, upon the request of the Company and at its expense, that the Executive will execute any other instrument and document necessary or desirable in applying for and obtaining patents in the United States and in any foreign country with respect to any Company Invention. The Executive further agrees, whether or not the Executive is then an employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its affiliates, upon request of the Company, to provide reasonable assistance with respect to the perfection, recordation or other documentation of the assignment of Company IP hereunder, and the enforcement of the Company s rights in any Company IP, and to cooperate to the extent and in the manner reasonably requested by the Company in any litigation or other claim or proceeding (including, without limitation, the prosecution or defense of any claim involving a patent) involving any Company IP covered by this Agreement, without further compensation, but all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Executive in satisfying the requirements of this Section 7(f) shall be paid by the Company or its designee. The Executive shall not, on or after the Commencement Date, directly or indirectly challenge the validity or enforceability of the Company s ownership of, or rights with respect to, any Company IP, including, without limitation, any patent issued on, or patent application filed in respect of, any Company Invention. For purposes of this Agreement, Company Invention shall mean any Invention that is made, conceived, invented, authored, or first actually reduced to practice, by the Executive (alone or jointly with others) (i) in the course of, in connection with, or as a result of the Executive s employment or other service with the Company or any of its affiliates (whether before, on, or after the Commencement Date, but not before the commencement of Executive s employment with the Company or its predecessor), (ii) at the direction or request of the Company or any of its affiliates (whether before, on, or after the Commencement Date), or (iii) through the use of, or that is related to, facilities, equipment, Confidential Information, other Company Inventions, intellectual property or other resources of the Company or any of its affiliates, whether or not during the Executive s work hours (and whether before, on, or after the Commencement Date, but not before the commencement of Executive s employment with the Company or its predecessor). For purposes of this Agreement, Invention shall mean any invention, formula, therapy, diagnostic technique, discovery, improvement, idea, technique, design, method, art, process, methodology, algorithm, machine, development, product, service, technology, strategy,

software, work of authorship or other Works (as defined below), trade secret, innovation, trademark, data, database, or the like, whether or not patentable, together with all intellectual property rights therein. 
 g. Works for Hire . The Executive also acknowledges and agrees that all works of authorship, in any format or medium, and whether published or unpublished, created wholly or in part by the Executive, whether alone or jointly with others, (i) in the course of, in connection with, or as a result of the Executive s employment or other service with the Company or any of its affiliates (whether before, on, or after the Commencement Date), (ii) at the direction or request of the Company or any of its affiliates (whether before, on, or after the Commencement Date), or (iii) through the use of, or that is related to, facilities, equipment, Confidential Information, other Company Inventions, intellectual property or other resources of the Company or any of its affiliates, whether or not during the Executive s work hours (and whether before, on, or after the Effective Date) Works ), are works made for hire as defined under United States copyright law, and that the Works (and all copyrights arising in the Works) are owned exclusively by the Company and all rights therein will automatically vest in the Company without the need for any further action by any party. To the extent any such Works are not deemed to be works made for hire, for consideration acknowledged and received, the Executive hereby waives any moral rights in such Works and the Executive hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, conveys and sets over to the Company or its designee, without compensation beyond that provided in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to such Works, including without limitation all rights of copyright arising therein or thereto, and further agrees to execute such assignments or other deeds of conveyance and transfer as the Company may request to vest in the Company or its designee all right, title and interest in and to such Works, including all rights of copyright arising in or related to the Works. 
 h. Cooperation . During and after the term hereof, the Executive agrees to cooperate with the Company and its affiliates in any internal investigation, any administrative, regulatory, or judicial proceeding or any dispute with a third-party concerning issues about which the Executive has knowledge or that may relate to the Executive or the Executive s employment or service with the Company or any of its affiliates (or the termination thereof). The Executive s obligation to cooperate hereunder includes, without limitation, being available to the Company and its affiliates upon reasonable notice for interviews and factual investigations, appearing in any forum at the Company s or any of its affiliates reasonable request to give testimony (without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process), volunteering to the Company and its affiliates pertinent information, and turning over to the Company and its affiliates all relevant documents which are or may come into the Executive s possession. The Company shall promptly reimburse the Executive for the reasonable pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with such cooperation. For the avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding sentence shall not require the Company to reimburse the Executive for any attorneys fees or related costs the Executive may incur absent advance written approval by the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
 i. Notification Requirement . Until the expiration of the period or periods for Restrictive Covenants (as applicable), the Executive shall, upon a reasonable request by the Company, give notice to the Company of any new business activity in which he is engaged.

The Executive shall provide the Company with such other pertinent information concerning such business activity as the Company may reasonably request in order to determine the Executive s continued compliance with the Restrictive Covenants. 
 
 -11- 

j. Enforcement of Covenants . The Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Restrictive Covenants. The Executive agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its affiliates and that each and every one of the Restrictive Covenants is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area, and otherwise. The Executive agrees that the Company and its affiliates, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to them, shall be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any of the Restrictive Covenants, without having to post bond, and to seek specific performance of each of the terms thereof. The Restrictive Covenants are intended for the benefit of the Company and each of its affiliates. Each affiliate of the Company is an intended third-party beneficiary of the Restrictive Covenants, and each affiliate of the Company, as well as any successor or assign of the Company or such affiliate, may enforce the Restrictive Covenants. The parties further agree that, in the event that any provision of the Restrictive Covenants shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities or otherwise, such provision shall be deemed to be modified by the court to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
 k. Notification of New Employer . In the event that the Executive is employed or otherwise engaged by any other person or entity following the Termination Date, the Executive agrees to notify, and consents to the notification by Company and its affiliates of, such person or entity of the Restrictive Covenants. 
 8. Excise Tax . 
 a. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise, to the extent that any payment, distribution or acceleration of vesting to or for the benefit of Executive by the Company (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder), whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the Total Payments ), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below) if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in Executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax), than if Executive received the entire amount of such Total Payments in accordance with their existing terms (taking into account federal, state, and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax). For purposes of this Agreement, the term Safe Harbor Amount means the largest portion of the Total Payments that would result in no portion of the Total Payments being subject to the Excise Tax. To effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which are payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating non-cash payments, in each case, starting with the payments to be made farthest in time from the Determination (as defined below). 
 b. The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in Section 8(a) and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company s expense by an accounting firm selected by Company from among the 10 largest accounting firms in the United States or by qualified independent tax counsel (the Determining Party provided, that Executive shall be given advance notice of the Determining Party selected by the Company, and shall have the opportunity to reject the selection, within two business days of being notified of the selection, on the basis of that Determining Party s having a conflict of interest or other reasonable basis, in which case the Company shall select an alternative firm among the 10 largest accounting firms in the United States or alternative independent qualified tax counsel, which shall become the Determining Party. Such Determining Party shall provide its determination (the Determination ), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and Executive, within 10 business days of the termination of Executive s employment or at such other time mutually agreed by the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive with respect to the Total Payments, it shall furnish Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to 
 -12- 

Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such payments and, absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that an Excise Tax would be payable, the Company shall have the right to accept the Determination as to the extent of the reduction, if any, pursuant to Section 8(a), or to have such Determination reviewed by another accounting firm selected by the Company, at the Company s expense. If the two accounting firms do not agree, a third accounting firm shall be jointly chosen by Executive and the Company, in which case the determination of such third accounting firm shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. 
 c. If, notwithstanding any reduction described in this Section 8, the Internal Revenue Service IRS determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of any of the Total Payments or otherwise, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within 30 calendar days after a final IRS determination or in the event that Executive challenges the final IRS determination, a final judicial determination, a portion of the Total Payments equal to the Repayment Amount . The Repayment Amount with respect to the payment of benefits shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that Executive s net after- tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed on the Total Payments) shall be maximized. The Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments being maximized. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 8, Executive shall pay the Excise Tax. 
 d. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, if (i) there is a reduction in the Total Payments as described in this Section 8, (ii) the IRS later determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of Executive s net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if Executive s benefits had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to Executive those payments or benefits which were reduced pursuant to this Section 8 as soon as administratively possible after Executive pays the Excise Tax (but not later than March 15 following the calendar year of the IRS determination) so that Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments are maximized. 
 e. If, following a reduction of the Total Payments pursuant to Section 8(a), the Determining Party or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Total Payments were reduced to a greater extent than required under Section 8, then the Company shall as soon as administratively possible (but not later than by March 15 following the calendar year of such determination) pay the amount of such excess reduction to or for the benefit of Executive, together with interest at the applicable federal rate (as defined in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code), from the date the amount would have otherwise been paid to Executive until the payment date. 
 f. To the extent requested by Executive, the Company shall cooperate with Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Determining Party shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by Executive (including, without limitation, Executive s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant, before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q&A-2(b) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q&A-9 and Q&A-40 to Q&A- 44 of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code and or exempt from the definition of the term parachute payment within the meaning of Q&A-2(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q&A- 5(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code. 
 9. Conflicting Agreements . The Executive hereby represents and warrants that the execution of this Agreement and the performance of his obligations hereunder will not breach or be in conflict with any other agreement to which the Executive is a party or is bound and that the Executive is not now subject to any covenants against competition or similar covenants or any court order or other legal obligation that would affect the performance of his obligations hereunder, any and all of which are superseded by this Agreement. The Executive will not disclose to or use on behalf of the Company any proprietary information of a third party without such party s consent. 
 -13- 

10. Indemnification . The Company shall indemnify the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. At the request of the Executive, and subject to the approval of the Board, the Company shall enter into an indemnification agreement with the Executive on terms at least as favorable in each respect to the Executive as the terms of any other indemnification agreement between the Company and any other director or officer of the Company. The Executive agrees to promptly notify the Company of any actual or threatened claim arising out of or as a result of his employment or other service with the Company or any of its affiliates (or the termination thereof). 
 11. Withholding . All payments made by the Company under this Agreement shall be reduced by any tax or other amounts required to be withheld by the Company under applicable law. 
 12. Assignment . Neither the Company nor the Executive may make any assignment of this Agreement or any interest herein, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other provided, however, that the Company may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement without the consent of the Executive in the event that the Company shall hereafter effect a reorganization, consolidate with, or merge into, any person or entity, transfer a substantial majority of its properties or assets to any person or entity, or engage in a similar transaction with any person or entity. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and the Executive, and their respective successors, executors, administrators, heirs and permitted assigns. 
 13. Severability . If any portion or provision of this Agreement shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such portion or provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
 14. Amendment and Waiver . This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by the Executive and the Company. No waiver of any provision hereof shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the waiving party. The failure of either party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement, shall not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach. No waiver by either of the parties of any breach by the other party hereto of any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by the other party hereto shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time. 
 15. Notices . Any and all notices, requests, demands and other communications provided for by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be effective when delivered in person or deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, registered or certified, and addressed
