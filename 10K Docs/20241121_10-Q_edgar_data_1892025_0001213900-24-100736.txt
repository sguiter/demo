Company has an equipment lease commencing on December 1, 2023 through December 1, 2026. The contract requires payments of per
month. Operating lease right-of-use asset and liability are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease

as the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Since the common area maintenance expenses are expenses that do not depend on an index or rate, they are excluded

In
view of the matters described in the preceding paragraph, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company s
ability to raise additional capital, obtain financing and to succeed in its future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date these financial statements are issued. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company has operating costs and expenses at the present time for development of its business activities. The Company, however, will be
required to raise additional capital over the next twelve months to meet its current administrative expenses, and it may do so in connection
with or in anticipation of possible acquisition transactions. This financing may take the form of additional sales of its equity securities
and/or convertible notes. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available, if required, or on terms favorable to the
Company.

Overview 

The Company is dedicated to advancing access to
clinical trial research through its portfolio company Clinical Research Alliance, Inc. CRA ), and until December 2023 when
it discontinued operations of its early stage pharmacy operation, through its portfolio company Worker s Health Rx (d/b/a Vitality
Rx ). 

Our vision for the Company is to continue to grow
by acquiring controlling interests in healthcare-related businesses with strong leadership teams, innovative products and services, and
proven technologies or processes that expand access to high quality healthcare and improve overall health outcomes and physical well-being.
Our goal at Optimus is to empower physicians and patients with the information, guidance and tools needed to make informed health care
choices. The Company seeks synergies among its portfolio companies and facilitates access to its management team which has extensive industry
experience and its network of financial and business partners to help finance growth and accelerate business market trajectories.

Clinical Research Alliance 

On December 28, 2020, the Company acquired
100 of the outstanding equity interests in Optimus Healthcare Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation Optimus ), in exchange
for 9,998,899 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock and 18,000,000 shares of its common stock. In connection with the transaction
all prior officers and directors of the Company resigned (except for Michael Pruitt) and new officers and directors were appointed as
officers and directors of the Company. On November 25, 2020, Clinical Research Alliance Acquisition Corp. CRAAC ), an entity
99 owned by Optimus, acquired 100 of the outstanding equity interests in CRA in exchange for 70 shares of its common stock. 

CRA provides services to a world-class team of
dedicated oncologists across the Tri-State area that are united by a shared commitment to conduct clinical research. CRA provides independent,
community-based oncology practices and hospitals in diverse communities with the necessary infrastructure and support to enroll their
patients in cutting edge clinical trials without the patients having to leave their physicians offices, hospitals or their local
communities. 

CRA currently supports a number of community-based
oncology practices and has signed an agreement with its first acute care hospital in Brooklyn, New York. CRA s current focus is
with oncologists in private practice, as well as rural and small hospitals in diverse communities. 

CRA contracts with pharmaceutical companies and
Contract Research Organizations CRO to conduct clinical trials (Phases I-IV) for investigational new drugs, biologics
and medical devices, and has worked with over 40 pharmaceutical companies since inception. CRA s customers consist primarily
of large and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In the last 12 years, CRA has conducted approximately 180 clinical trials.
As CRA was the highest enroller in many of these clinical trials, many of those clinical trials led to FDA approval for the trial compounds
used to treat various cancers. Depending on the clinical trial design, CRA invoices the pharmaceutical manufacturer for some or all of
the following services: startup fees, diagnostic tests, laboratory tests, patient stipends, pharmacy fees, patient visits, document storage
and the reporting of serious adverse events. 

CRA also contracts with independent community-based
oncology practices and hospitals in diverse communities to assist in the conduct of the clinical trials. CRA s services to the community-based
practices and hospitals in diverse communities include: 

(1) 
 maintaining the documentation necessary for the conduct of the clinical trial; 

(2) 
 obtaining Internal Review Board IRB approval; 

(3) 
 collecting data required by the trial protocol; 

(4) 
 filing regulatory and compliance related documentation; and 

(5) 
 dispensing drugs necessary to conduct the clinical trial. 

Our contracts with the community-based oncology
practices and hospitals include specific budgets for particular services rendered. The contracts may range in duration from a few months
to several years or longer depending on the nature of the work performed. In some cases, a portion of the contract fee is paid at the
time the contract is executed with the balance of the contract fee payable either monthly or in installments upon the achievement of milestones
over the study duration. Our contracts generally may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon short notice. Our contracts
with our community-based oncology practices and hospitals result in the payment of fees for services rendered to the principal investigator
that is conducting a particular clinical trial. The COVID-19 pandemic did not impact any open trials that were ongoing as CRA was able
to conduct business remotely instead of through on-site visits. However, it did impact the number of new trials that were initiated in
2020 and 2021. The number of oncology trials rebounded in 2022 and 2023. 

29 

CRA employs experienced Clinical Research Coordinators
that travel to the community-based oncology practices and hospitals for required study visits. Additionally, CRA s principal investigator
for a specific clinical trial is in contact with the oncology practices and hospitals to provide the necessary oversight. Community-based
oncology practices and hospitals choose CRA because we provide the opportunity to conduct and conveniently enroll their patients in important
clinical trials often unavailable to those community-based oncology practices and hospitals. In addition, CRA is committed to increasing
clinical trial access to patients from diverse and underserved communities that will better represent the real-world population. Although
CRA s historical focus has been in the area of oncology, in the future we intend to expand our therapeutic reach into other therapeutic
areas, including possibly gastroenterology, dermatology, cardiology, urology and ophthalmology. The National Institutes of Health estimate
that there are currently 126,164 active clinical studies in these therapeutic areas. 

The clinical research industry is fragmented,
consisting of many small, niche service providers, a number of medium-sized providers and a number of large CROs that are differentiated
by the scale of their global operations, breadth of service portfolios and supporting technology infrastructure. Companies like CRA
generally compete on the basis of previous product experience, the ability to recruit patients, the depth of therapeutic and scientific
expertise, the strength of project teams, price and increasingly on the ability to apply new innovation that can drive significant time
and cost savings throughout the development process. 

Vitality Rx 

On January 28, 2022, the Company entered into
a stock purchase agreement with Worker s Health Rx, Inc., d/b/a Vitality Rx Vitality Rx and Marc Wiener, the sole
shareholder, who was also our President, until his resignation on April 26, 2023, pursuant to which we acquired 100 of the outstanding
equity interests of Vitality Rx in exchange for the issuance of 250,000 shares of our common stock and 350,000. The cash portion of the
purchase price has been paid in full. 

Vitality Rx was an early-stage
pharmacy dedicated to serving the pharmacy needs of patients in the community and residing in Assisted Living and Independent Living facilities
throughout the tristate area. In addition, Vitality Rx was exploring the possibility of providing IVIG to a number of physician
offices in the community: including but not limited to: neurologists, Ob/Gyn infectious disease. This offering was in
a preliminary stage until the Company decided to discontinue its operations in December 2023.

notes and in June 2022, the Company issued an additional 2.2 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes on the same terms
as the Notes issued in May 2021. Any outstanding amounts of these convertible notes mature on May 25, 2024 and June 7, 2024, respectively.

All loans are interest bearing and are subordinated to the Convertible Notes Payable (see Note 12). 

Substantial additional financing will continue
to be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to commercially develop its services. Management is currently evaluating different
strategies to obtain the required funding for future operations. These strategies may include but are not limited to: private offerings
of Common Stock, public offerings of equity and/or debt securities, payments from potential strategic research and development and licensing
and/or marketing arrangements. Management believes that these ongoing and planned financing endeavors, if successful, may provide adequate
financial resources to continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months from the date the financial statements are issued;
however, there can be no assurance in this regard. If the Company is unable to secure adequate additional funding, its business, operating
results, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, which could include curtailing, halting or selling
its operations.

42 

Each share of Preferred Stock shall have a stated

exercise price of 0.075. The Investor may exercise the Warrants on a cashless basis at any time after issuance. In the event the Investor

Company for a period of one year from the time the securities are registered, as well as customary adjustments provisions for stock splits,

The Investor has contractually agreed to restrict
their ability to exercise the Warrants and convert the Preferred Stock such that the number of shares of the Company common stock held

convert into the Preferred Stock sold to the Investor. 

The closing of the above
transaction was to be paid no later than November 11, 2024. The Company has not received the proceeds under this subscription agreement
by November 11, 2024 and as such is in default of its second amendment to the forbearance agreement
(the Amendment by and among the Company and Arena Investors, LP, as agent Agent for the purchasers of the
Company s senior secured convertible notes (collectively, the Purchasers issued in May 2021 (the May 2021
Notes and June 2022 (the June 2022 Notes and collectively with the May 2021 Notes, the Notes (see
Note 12). The Company will not have sufficient funds to operate its business, and as such is in process of taking legal action against
the accredited investor, as well as seeking other alternatives to raise cash in the interim, including a potential sale of its business
or potentially curtailing or ceasing operations. 

On
November 13, 2024, the Company received 150,000 governed by a subscription agreement under the same prorata terms as noted in the above
 2 million subscription agreement. The Company entered into this subscription agreement (the Agreement with an accredited
investor (the Investor pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell 150 shares of the Company s series
C convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Stock for aggregate gross proceeds of 150,000. In connection with the Agreement,
the Company also agreed to issue the Investor warrants (the Warrants to purchase 2,742,900 shares of the Company s
common stock. No assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to refinance, restructure or repay our indebtedness or to
continue as a going concern. 

The independent auditors report
accompanying our December 31, 2023 and 2022 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going-concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue in existence. The Company has incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and
has an accumulated deficit of 33,814,142 as of September 30, 2024. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such
time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales or revenue from its services. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

43 

As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 152,357 and 100,319, respectively. Our working capital (deficit) at September 30, 2024 was 9,424,229).
We will, however, in the future require additional cash resources to fund operating losses, due to changing business conditions, implementation
of our strategy to expand our business, or other investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources are
insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities. The sale of additional equity
securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations
and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available
in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could
limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects. 

The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans for the Company s
operating businesses provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we had net cash flow used in operating activities of 281,772. The cash flow used in operating activities resulted primarily from the
net loss and noncash stock based compensation for the period, as partially offset by amortization of debt discounts, increases in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in accounts and notes receivable. 

We had no net cash flow provided by investing
activities as we had closed our investing account in April 2023 and also had no purchases of fixed assets. 

We had net cash flow provided by financing activities
of 333,810 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of proceeds
from bridge loans in the amount of 340,000. 

As a result of the foregoing, the Company had
a net increase in cash of 52,038 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Inflation 

We believe that inflation has not had a material
adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK. 

The Company is not required to provide the information
required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end
of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide
absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date,
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

45 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, we may become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an
adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such
legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or operating results. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Our business,
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control,
including those set forth in our other filings with the SEC, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on
our actual results. There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors previously disclosed in our other filings with the SEC.
