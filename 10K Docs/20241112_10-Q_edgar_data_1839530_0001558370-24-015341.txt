Unbilled receivables are accrued and represent work performed in accordance with the terms of contracts with customers. Deferred revenues relate to payments received in advance of performance under a contract. A significant portion of this balance relates to maintenance contracts or other service contracts where the Company received payments for upfront conversions or implementation activities which do not transfer a service to the customer but rather are used in fulfilling the related performance obligations that transfer over time. The advance consideration received from customers

 million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, that had been deferred as of December 31, 2023. The Company recognized revenue of million during the year ended December 31, 2023 that had been deferred as of January 1, 2023. Costs incurred to obtain and fulfill contracts are deferred and presented as part of intangible assets, net and expensed on a straight-line basis over the estimated benefit period. These costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition or fulfillment and can be separated into two principal categories: contract commissions and fulfillment costs. Applying the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4, the incremental costs of obtaining contracts are recognized as an expense when incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The effect of applying this practical expedient was not material. Customer deposits consist primarily of amounts received from customers in advance for postage. These advanced postage deposits are used to cover the costs associated with postage, with the corresponding postage revenue being recognized as services are performed. Performance Obligations At the inception of each contract, the Company assesses the goods and services promised in the Company s contracts and identifies each distinct performance obligation. The majority of the Company s contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts. For the majority of the Company s business and transaction processing service contracts, revenues are recognized as services are provided based on an appropriate input or output method, typically based on the related labor or transactional volumes. Certain of the Company s contracts have multiple performance obligations, including contracts that combine software implementation services with post-implementation customer support. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which the Company estimates the expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and adds an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service. The adjusted market approach is also used whereby the Company estimates the price that customers in the market would be willing to pay. In assessing whether to allocate variable consideration to a specific part of the contract, the Company considers the nature of the variable payment and whether it relates specifically to its efforts to satisfy a specific part of the contract. Certain of the Company s software implementation performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time, typically when customer acceptance is obtained. When evaluating the transaction price, the Company analyzes, on a contract-by-contract basis, all applicable variable considerations. The nature of the Company s contracts gives rise to variable consideration, including volume discounts, contract penalties, and other similar items that generally decrease the transaction price. These amounts are estimated based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized. The Company does not anticipate significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration. Reimbursements from customers, such as postage costs, are included in revenue, while the related costs are included in cost of revenue.

 industries and geographies. We believe our business ultimately advances digital transformation, improves market-wide liquidity, and encourages sustainable business practices. The Company s digital foundation was developed to deliver fully outsourced solutions to address current and evolving client needs. The Company hosts its products both on client premises and as a SaaS offering in the cloud. These offerings, along with several hybrid solutions are available to clients based on the client s needs and preferences. When distributing its licenses, the Company offers a flexible model, whereby clients may choose among licenses covering a maximum number of transactions, multi-year term licenses with flexible renewal options, perpetual licenses, or per user subscriptions. The Company s primary source of revenue stems from transactions processed by its products, including bills and payments processing and constitutes the dominant part of revenue in our larger, Bills Payments reporting segment. Other sources of revenue include the sale of recurring software licenses and professional services, perpetual software licenses, as well as hardware solutions and related maintenance and constitute our other, Technology reporting segment. The Company offers an industry-agnostic and cross-departmental suite of products, which center around finance and accounting F A solutions and services comprised of the XBP Platform, Request to Pay, enterprise information management, Digital Mailroom, business process management and workflow automation, and integrated communication services. The Company also offers core industry solutions for the banking and financial services sector, and has, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, rolled out a suite of Work From Anywhere WFA applications with enterprise software for connectivity and productivity to enable remote work. The continued success of the Company s business is driven by its people. Its operation centers are located in areas where the value proposition the Company offers is attractive relative to other local opportunities, resulting in an engaged, educated multi-lingual workforce that is able to make a meaningful global contribution from their local marketplace. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 1,500 employees (of which 147 were part-time employees) across 16 countries (14 across Europe and in Morocco as well as the U.S., where our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are located).

 Our Segments Our two reportable segments are Bills Payments and Technology. These segments are comprised of significant strategic business units that align our products and services with how we manage our business, approach our key markets and interact with our clients based on their respective industries. Bills and Payments: The Bills Payments business unit primarily focuses on optimizing how bills and payments are processed by businesses of all sizes and industries. The Company offers automation of AP and AR processes and through an integrated platform, seeks to integrate buyers and suppliers across Europe. This business unit also includes our digital transformation revenue, which is both project based and recurring. Technology : The Technology business unit primarily focuses on sales of recurring and perpetual software licenses and related maintenance, hardware solutions and related maintenance and professional services. Key Performance Indicators We use a variety of operational and financial measures to assess our performance. Among the measures considered by our management are the following: Revenue by segment; Gross profit by segment; and Adjusted EBITDA (which is a non-GAAP financial measure). 
 Revenue by segment We analyze our revenue by comparing actual monthly revenue to internal projections and prior periods across our operating segments in order to assess performance, identify potential areas for improvement, and determine whether segments are meeting management s expectations. Gross profit by segment The Company defines Gross Profit as revenue less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). The Company uses Gross Profit by segment to assess financial performance at the segment level. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its financial data presented on a basis consistent with GAAP, this report contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are financial measures used by management to evaluate the Company s core operating performance and trends, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. These measures exclude certain expenses that are required under GAAP. The Company excludes these items because they are non-recurring or non-cash expenses that are determined based in part on the Company s underlying performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA We define EBITDA as net income (loss), plus taxes, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus restructuring and related expenses, related party management fee and royalties, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in fair value of warrant liability, and non-recurring transaction costs incurred in connection with the Business Combination.

 Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial performance and results of operations as our board of directors and management use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance, because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of our management team. Net income/loss is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not required to be uniformly applied, are not audited and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following tables present a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

SG A expenses increased as a percentage of revenue at 18.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 18.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Related Party Expense Related party expense was 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the cost optimization initiatives taken during the current period, partially offset by increase in related party service fees. Depreciation and Amortization Total depreciation and amortization expense was 2.4 million and 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in total depreciation and amortization expense by 0.2 million was primarily due to an increase in amortization expense related to outsource contract costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Interest Expense Interest expense was 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to higher pension interest cost and an increase in borrowing costs due to an increase in relevant borrowing reference rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Related Party Interest Expense (Income), Net Related party interest expense, net was less than 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to related party interest income, net of 1 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Foreign Exchange Losses, net Foreign exchange losses were 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to foreign exchange losses of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a higher unrealized exchange losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Changes in fair value of warrant liability The change in fair value of warrant liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a gain of 45 thousand. The change in fair value of warrant liability resulted from the remeasurement of the Private Warrant liability between December 31, 2023 and the end of the reporting period, September 30, 2024. Pension Income, net Pension income, net was 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to pension income, net of 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in pension income was primarily due to an increase in pension-related income recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Income Tax Expense The Company had an income tax expense of 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income tax expense of 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the income tax expenses for the current period is higher than the same period last year due to a remeasurement of existing uncertain tax positions in Germany. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 cash and cash equivalents totaled 7.8 million and 6.5 million, respectively. The Company currently expects to spend approximately 1.5 to 2.5 million on total capital expenditures and capitalizable contracts set-up cost over the next twelve months. The Company will continue to evaluate additional capital expenditure needs that may arise. As of September 30, 2024, and in comparison to December 31, 2023, total debt increased by 14.8 million primarily due borrowings under the 2024 Senior Credit Facilities, partially offset by repayments of Revolving Credit Facilities and 2022 Committed Facility Agreement (See Indebtedness below). The Company has utilized COVID-19 relief measures in various European jurisdictions, including permitted deferrals of certain payroll, social security and value added taxes. At the end of the third quarter 2024, the Company paid

Table of Contents 
 a significant portion of these deferred payroll taxes, social security and value added taxes. The remaining balance of deferred payroll taxes, social security and value added taxes is expected to be paid by April 2027, or later, as per deferment timeline as established by local laws and regulations. The Company believes the current cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from financing activities are sufficient to meet the Company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months. To the extent existing cash, cash from operations, and amounts available for borrowing are insufficient to fund future activities, the Company may need to raise additional capital. The Company may require funding for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, cost overruns for reasons outside of its control and it may experience slower sales than anticipated. If the Company s current cash on hand is not sufficient to meet its financing requirements for the next twelve months, it may have to raise funds to allow it to continue to operate its business and execute on its business plan. The Company cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all particularly given the amount of Company securities being offered, the terms of such securities and the potential duration of any offering. To the extent that the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact the Company s ability to conduct business or return capital to investors. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, it may have to significantly scale back, delay or discontinue certain businesses, restrict its operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms. Cash Flows Our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include cash flows related to the disposable group. Significant non-cash items and capital expenditures of discontinued operations related to our disposable group are presented separately in Note 3 - Discontinued Operations of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report.

Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The cash outflow of 1.4 million in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to additions to property, plant and equipment during the period.

 September 30, 2024 was primarily due to borrowings under the 2024 Senior Credit Facilities, partially offset by repayments of Revolving Credit Facilities and 2022 Committed Facility Agreement, and reduction in net borrowing under the securitization facility due to the entry into the Amended Factoring Agreement on September 15, 2023, which resulted in an off-balance sheet treatment of the Secured Borrowing Facility. Indebtedness Secured Borrowing Facility On August 25, 2020, certain entities entered into an agreement wherein amounts due from clients were pledged to a third party, in exchange for a borrowing facility in amounts up to a total of 31.0 million (the Secured Borrowing Facility ). The proceeds from the Secured Borrowing Facility were determined by the amounts invoiced to our clients. The amounts due from clients were recorded in accounts receivable and the amount due to the third party as a liability, presented under current portion of long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The cost of the Secured Borrowing Facility was 0.10 of newly assigned receivables with minimum of 0.1 million in annual fees and the Secured Borrowing Facility bore interest at Euribor rate plus 0.70 on the unpaid principal amount. The Company incurred interest expense of 0 and 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0 and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the Secured Borrowing Facility.

The relevant entities shall have no continuing involvement in the transferred accounts receivable, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable shall no longer be available to satisfy creditors of the relevant entities. The Company accounted for the transactions under the Amended Factoring Agreement as a sale under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing , and treats it as an off-balance sheet arrangement. Net funds received from the transfers reflect the face value of the account less a fee, which is recorded as an increase to cash and a reduction to accounts receivable outstanding in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports the cash flows attributable to the sale of account receivables to the Factor and the cash receipts from collections made on behalf of and paid to the Factor under the Amended Factoring Agreement, on a net basis as trade accounts receivables in cash flows from operating activities in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s outstanding factored accounts receivable amounted to 9.2 million pursuant to the Amended Factoring Agreement, representing the face value of the invoices. The Company recognizes factoring costs upon disbursement of funds.

 December 31, 2023 and related liabilities are recorded within accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023. The Company periodically evaluates and, if necessary, adjusts its estimates based on currently available information. Potential Future Transactions We may, from time to time, explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions, which may include joint ventures, as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets. In order to pursue certain of these opportunities, additional funds will likely be required. Subject to applicable contractual restrictions, to obtain such financing, we may seek to use cash on hand, or we may seek to raise additional debt or equity financing through private placements or through underwritten offerings. There can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances, nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for transactions that require additional funds on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement that we entered into in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, certain of our stockholders have the right to demand underwritten offerings of our Common Stock. We may from time to time in the future explore, with certain of those stockholders the possibility of an underwritten public offering of our Common Stock held by those stockholders. There can be no assurance as to whether or when an offering may be commenced or completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates. The critical accounting policies provide a better understanding of how the Company develops its assumptions and judgments about future events and related estimations and how they can impact the Company s financial statements. A critical accounting estimate is one that requires subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the Company s results of operations. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company believes the current assumptions, judgments and estimates used to determine amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate; however, actual results may differ under different conditions. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Refer to "Critical Accounting Estimates" contained in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K for a complete discussion of critical accounting estimates. There have been no material changes to 2023 Form 10-K. Emerging Growth Company Status The Jumpstart our Business Startups Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act and has elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards, although it may decide to early adopt such new or revised accounting standards to the extent permitted by such standards. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare the Company s financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company s market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of the Company s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the 2023 Form 10-K. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such review and evaluation, our CEO and our CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our internal controls were not effective due to material weaknesses identified. The material weakness identified related to ineffective review controls over the financial statement closing process and order-to cash process including the review of new agreements and work orders. In light of these material weaknesses and subsequent to the recent completion of the Business Combination, we have enhanced our review controls, added experienced people across order to cash sub-processes for managing critical control activities, and rationalized the controls framework to remove duplicate and redundant controls. We have also established a Center of Excellence (COE) by consolidating financial processes to strengthen the controls framework. The COE s mission is to create appropriate finance structures, formalize lines of reporting and appoint competent personnel with defined roles and responsibilities to strengthen internal controls. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. We believe our efforts will enhance our controls relating to financial reporting, but we can offer no assurance that our controls will not require additional review and modification in the future as industry accounting practice may evolve over time. Notwithstanding such material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss and stockholders deficit for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of our operations and our cash flows for the periods presented in this Annual Report, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.

 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting Other than as disclosed above, there was no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Subsidiary Litigation A group of 71 former employees brought a claim against a subsidiary of the Company related to their dismissal resulting from the closure of two production sites in France in 2020. The employees filed complaints with the Labor Court on June 9, 2022. Conciliation hearings at the Labor Court were held on September 27, 2022, December 13, 2022, March 7, 2023, September 5, 2023 and November 14, 2023. In March 2023, 67 claimants (after the in principle settlement was agreed with the first 4 claimants) filed an application for summary proceedings in respect of part of the claim for a total claim of 1.1 million. The summary proceedings hearing was held on April 11, 2023 and the court issued its decision on May 9, 2023 upholding all of the plaintiffs claims for a total amount of 1.1 million, however the court s decision does not increase the Company s anticipated exposure for the overall claim. The Company has appealed against the decision (and paid the amount of 1.1 million on November 10, 2023 pending the appeal), the appeal hearing was scheduled for September 9, 2024 and was held on November 4, 2024. The next hearing, pertaining only to 15 remaining claimants who have not concluded settlement agreements with the Company, is scheduled for January 13, 2025. The substantive hearing was held on February 16, 2024 and a decision was made at the end of June 2024. The Company reached a number of settlements with a certain number of claimants prior to the decision of the court and approximately 1.8 million was paid to such claimants in addition to the amounts paid as part of the summary proceedings. The court awarded 1.2 million to the claimants who had not settled before the court s decision and, after the deduction of the amounts already paid to such claimants, 1.0 million remain to be paid by the Company. The Company will also be responsible for up to three months unemployment allowance paid to these claimants by the unemployment fund, which is not expected to significantly increase the Company s total costs. The Company has appealed the decision. The Company accrued 1.1 million and 2.2 million in accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, based on the estimate of the range of possible losses. Other We are, from time to time, involved in other legal proceedings, inquiries, claims and disputes, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Although our management cannot predict the outcomes of these matters, our management believes these actions will not have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this quarterly report, you should carefully consider the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in those Risk Factors are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
