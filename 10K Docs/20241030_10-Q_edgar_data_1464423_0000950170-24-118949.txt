SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FO RWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, potential, intend, expect, seek, anticipate, estimate, approximately, believe, could, project, predict, continue, plan or other similar words or expressions. 
 Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions, discuss future expectations, future plans and strategies, contain financial and operating projections or state other forward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include the following: 
 projections of our revenues, income, earnings per share, capital structure or other financial items; 

descriptions of our plans or objectives for future operations, products or services; 

forecasts of our future economic performance, interest rates, profit margins and our share of future markets; and 

descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing expectations regarding the timing of generating any revenues. 

Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future events, actions, plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations. Some of these factors are discussed below. 
 You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Report and the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 22, 2024.

changes in government support of home ownership and home affordability programs; 

changes in our investment objectives or investment or operational strategies, including any new lines of business or new products and services that may subject us to additional risks;

Accordingly, under the agreement, PLS currently purchases loans saleable in accordance with the Ginnie Mae MBS Guide as is and without recourse of any kind from the Company at cost less any administrative fees paid by the correspondent to the Company plus accrued interest and a sourcing fee. The Company may also sell conventional loans to PLS under the same arrangement subject to mutual agreement between the parties. Sourcing fees range from to basis points of the loans' UPBs, generally based on the average number of calendar days the loans are held by PMT before purchase by PLS . The mortgage banking services ag reement expires, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, on , subject to automatic renewal for additional -month periods, unless terminated in accordance with its terms. The Company may purchase newly originated conforming balance non-government insured or guaranteed loans from PLS under a mortgage loan purchase and sale agreement.

Management Fees The Company has a management agreement with PCM pursuant to which PMT pays PCM management fees as follows: A base management fee that is calculated quarterly and is equal to the sum of (i) per year of average shareholders equity up to billion, (ii) per year of average shareholders equity in excess of billion and up to billion, and (iii) per year of average shareholders equity in excess of billion. 

 A performance incentive fee that is calculated quarterly at a defined annualized percentage of the amount by which net income, on a rolling four-quarter basis and before deducting the incentive fee, exceeds certain levels of return on equity. 

14 

of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds (i) an return on equity plus the high watermark , up to (ii) a return on equity plus 

 of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds (i) a return on equity plus the high watermark , up to (ii) a return on equity plus 

of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds a return on equity plus the high watermark. 

 For the purpose of determining the amount of the performance incentive fee: Net income is defined as net income or loss attributable to the Company s common shares of beneficial interest Common Shares calculated in accordance with GAAP, and adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges after discussion between PCM and the Company s independent trustees and after approval by a majority of the Company s independent trustees. Equity is the weighted average of the issue price per Common Share of all of the Company s public offerings, multiplied by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding (including restricted share units) in the rolling four-quarter period. High watermark is the quarterly adjustment that reflects the amount by which the net income (stated as a percentage of return on "equity") exceeds or falls short of the lesser of and the average Fannie Mae - year MBS yield (the "Target Yield") for the rolling four quarters then ended. The high watermark starts at zero and is adjusted quarterly. If the net income is lower than the Target Yield, the high watermark is increased by the difference. If the net income is higher than the Target Yield, the high watermark is reduced by the difference. Each time a performance incentive fee is earned, the high watermark returns to zero. As a result, the threshold amounts required for PCM to earn a performance incentive fee are adjusted cumulatively based on the performance of PMT s net income over (or under) the Target Yield, until the net income in excess of the Target Yield exceeds the then-current cumulative high watermark amount. The base management fee and the performance incentive fee are both payable quarterly in arrears. The performance incentive fee may be paid in cash or a combination of cash and the Company s Common Shares (subject to a limit of no more than paid in Common Shares), at the Company s option. In the event of termination of the management agreement between the Company and PCM, PCM may be entitled to a termination fee in certain circumstances.

Expense Reimbursement Under the management agreement, PCM is entitled to reimbursement of its organizational and operating expenses, including third-party expenses, incurred on the Company s behalf, it being understood that PCM and its affiliates shall allocate a portion of their personnel s time to provide certain legal, tax and investor relations services for the direct benefit of the Company. PCM is reimbursed per fiscal quarter for these services, such amount to be reviewed annually and to not preclude reimbursement for any other services performed by PCM or its affiliates. The Company is required to pay PCM and its affiliates a portion of the rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of PCM and its affiliates required for the Company s and its subsidiaries operations. These expenses are allocated based on the ratio of the Company s and its subsidiaries proportion of gross assets compared to all remaining gross assets managed or owned by PCM and/or its affiliates as calculated at each fiscal quarter end.

As the UPB of the underlying loans subject to each CRT arrangement decreased through repayments, the percentage exposure to losses of each CRT arrangement increased to maximums ranging from to of outstanding UPB, although the total dollar amount of exposure to losses did not increase. The Company has concluded that the subsidiary trust entities holding its CRT arrangements are VIEs and the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as it is the holder of the primary beneficial interests which absorb the variability of the trusts income. For CRT arrangements where losses are triggered based on the loans delinquency status, the Company recognizes its IO ownership interests and recourse obligations on the consolidated balance sheets as CRT Derivatives in Derivative assets and Derivative and credit risk transfer strip liabilities. For CRT securities where losses are absorbed when the reference loans realize credit losses, the Company recognizes its IO ownership interests and recourse obligations as CRT strips which are included on the consolidated balance sheet in Derivative and credit risk transfer strip liabilities. Gains and losses on the derivatives and strips (including the IO ownership interest sold to a nonaffiliate) included in the CRT arrangements are included in Net gains (losses) on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of income.

Subordinate Mortgage-Backed Securities The Company retains or purchases subordinate MBS in transactions sponsored by PMC or a nonaffiliate. Cash inflows from the loans underlying these securities are distributed to investors and service providers in accordance with the respective securities' contractual priorities of payments and, as such, most of these inflows must be directed first to service and repay the senior securities. The rights of holders of subordinate securities to receive distributions of principal and/or interest, as applicable, are subordinate to the rights of holders of senior securities. After the senior securities are repaid, substantially all cash inflows will be directed to the subordinate securities, including those held by the Company, until they are fully repaid.

Financing of Mortgage Servicing Assets The Company entered into financing transactions in which VIEs issued variable funding notes, term notes and term loans backed by beneficial interests in Fannie Mae MSRs. The Company acts as guarantor of the variable funding notes, term notes and term loans. The Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because, as the holder of the variable funding notes and issuer of performance guarantees, it holds the variable interests in the VIEs. Therefore, the Company consolidates the VIEs. For financial reporting purposes, the MSRs financed by the consolidated VIEs are included in Mortgage servicing rights at fair value, the variable funding notes sold under agreements to repurchase are included in Assets sold under agreements to repurchase and the term notes and term loans are included in Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The financing is described in Note 15 Long Term Debt .

The Company remeasures its REO based on fair value when it evaluates the REO properties for impairment. The Company evaluates its REO for impairment with reference to the respective properties fair values less costs to sell. REO may be revalued after acquisition due to the Company receiving greater access to the property, the property being held for an extended period or receiving indications that the property s fair value may not be supported by developing market conditions. Any subsequent change in fair value to a level that is less than or equal to the property s cost is recognized in Results of real estate acquired in settlement of loans in the Company s consolidated statements of income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Amortized Cost Most of the Company s borrowings are carried at amortized cost. The Company s Assets sold under agreements to repurchase , Mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements, Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets and the Exchangeable Notes, defined in Note 15 Long-Term Debt , are classified as Level 3 fair value liabilities due to the Company s reliance on unobservable inputs to estimate these instruments fair values. The Company classifies the 2028 Senior Notes, defined in Note 15 Long-Term Debt , as Level 2 fair value liabilities. The Company has concluded that the fair values of these borrowings other than term notes and term loans included in Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets and the Unsecured senior notes approximate the agreements carrying values due to the borrowing agreements variable interest rates and short maturities. The Company estimates the fair values of the term notes and term loans included in Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets using indications of fair value provided by nonaffiliate brokers for the term notes, internal estimates of fair value for the term loans, and pricing services for the Unsecured senior notes. 

Unsecured senior notes 

Valuation Governance Most of the Company s assets, its Asset-backed financings at fair value, Interest-only security payable at fair value and Derivative and credit risk transfer strip liabilities at fair value are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. A substantial portion of these items are Level 3 fair value assets and liabilities which require the use of unobservable inputs that are significant to the estimation of the fair values of the assets and liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own judgments about the factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability and are based on the best information available under the circumstances. Due to the difficulty in estimating the fair values of Level 3 fair value assets and liabilities, the Company has assigned responsibility for estimating the fair values of these assets and liabilities to specialized staff within PFSI's capital markets group and subjects the valuation process to significant senior management oversight. With respect to Level 3 valuations other than IRLCs, the capital markets valuation staff reports to PFSI s senior management valuation committee, which oversees the valuations. The capital markets valuation staff monitors the models used for valuation of the Company s Level 3 fair value assets and liabilities other than IRLCs, including the models performance versus actual results, and

 Derivative and Credit Risk Transfer Strip Assets and Liabilities CRT Derivatives The Company categorizes CRT derivatives as Level 3 fair value assets and liabilities. The fair values of CRT derivatives are based on indications of fair value provided to the Company by nonaffiliate brokers for the certificates representing the beneficial interests in the trusts holding the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors , the recourse obligations and the IO ownership interests. Together, the recourse obligation and the IO ownership interest comprise the CRT derivative. Fair values of the CRT derivatives are derived by deducting the balances of the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors from the fair values of the certificates. The Company assesses the fair values it receives from nonaffiliate brokers using the discounted cash flow approach. The significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in its review and approval of the valuation of CRT derivatives are the discount rates, voluntary and involuntary prepayment speeds and the remaining loss expectations of the reference loans. Changes in fair value of CRT derivatives are included in Net gains (losses) on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of income.

Interest Rate Lock Commitments The Company categorizes IRLCs as Level 3 fair value assets and liabilities. The Company estimates the fair values of IRLCs based on quoted Agency MBS prices, the probability that the loans will be purchased under the commitments (the pull-through rate and the Company s estimate of the fair values of the MSRs it expects to receive upon sale of the loans. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s IRLCs are the pull-through rates and the estimated MSRs attributed to the mortgage loans subject to the commitments. Significant changes in the pull-through rates or the MSR components of the IRLCs, in isolation, may result in a significant change in the IRLCs fair values. The financial effects of changes in these inputs are generally inversely correlated as increasing interest rates have a positive effect on the fair value of the MSR component of an IRLC s fair value, but also increase the pull-through rate for the loan principal and interest payment cash flow component that has decreased in fair value. Changes in fair value of IRLCs are included in Net gains on loans acquired for sale in the consolidated statements of income.

Mortgage Servicing Rights The Company categorizes MSRs as Level 3 fair value assets. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair values of MSRs. The fair values of MSRs are derived from the net positive cash flows associated with the servicing agreements. The Company receives a servicing fee based on the remaining UPB of the loans subject to the servicing agreements and generally has the right to receive other remuneration including various mortgagor-contracted fees such as late charges and collateral reconveyance charges, and is generally entitled to retain any placement fees earned on certain custodial funds held pending remittance of mortgagor principal, interest, tax and insurance payments. The key inputs used in the estimation of the fair value of MSRs include the applicable pricing spreads, the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, and the annual per-loan costs to service the loans, all of which are unobservable. Significant changes to any of those inputs in isolation could result in significant changes in the MSR fair value measurements. Changes in these key inputs are not directly related. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are included in Net loan servicing fees From nonaffiliates Change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights in the consolidated statements of income.

Real Estate Acquired in Settlement of Loans REO is measured based on its fair value on a nonrecurring basis and is categorized as a Level 3 fair value asset. Fair value of REO is established by using a current estimate of fair value from either a broker s price opinion, a full appraisal, or the price given in a pending contract of sale. REO fair values are reviewed by PLS staff appraisers when the Company obtains multiple indications of fair value and there is a significant difference between the indications of fair value. PLS staff appraisers will attempt to resolve the difference between the indications of fair value. In circumstances where the staff appraisers are not able to generate adequate data to support a fair value conclusion, the staff appraisers obtain an additional appraisal to determine fair value. Recognized changes in the fair value of REO are included in Results of real estate acquired in settlement of loans in the consolidated statements of income.

Derivative liabilities 

Credit risk transfer strip liabilities 

The Company records all derivative and CRT strip assets and liabilities at fair value and records changes in fair value in current period income. Derivative Activities The Company holds and issues derivative financial instruments in connection with its operating, investing and financing activities. Derivative financial instruments are created as a result of the Company s operations and the Company also enters into derivative transactions as part of its interest rate risk management activities. Derivative financial instruments created as a result of the Company s operations include: IRLCs that are created when the Company commits to purchase loans acquired for sale; and 

 Certain of the CRT arrangements whereby the Company retained recourse obligations relating to loans it sold into Fannie Mae guaranteed securitizations as part of the retention of IO ownership interests in such loans. 

 The Company engages in interest rate risk management activities in an effort to reduce the variability of earnings caused by the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair values of certain of its assets and liabilities. The Company bears price risk related to its mortgage production, servicing assets and MBS financing activities due to changes in market interest rates as discussed below: The Company is exposed to losses if market mortgage interest rates increase, because market interest rate increases generally cause the fair values of MBS, IRLCs and loans acquired for sale to decrease. 

 The Company is exposed to losses if market mortgage interest rates decrease, because market interest rate decreases generally encourage increased mortgage refinancing activities, which causes the fair values of MSRs to decrease. 

 To manage the price risk resulting from these interest rate risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments with the intention of moderating the risk that changes in market interest rates will result in unfavorable changes in the fair values of the

Mortgage Loan Participation Purchase and Sale Agreement One of the borrowing facilities secured by loans acquired for sale is in the form of a mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreement. Participation certificates, each of which represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a pool of loans that have been pooled with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, are sold to the lender pending the securitization of such loans and the sale of the resulting security. The commitment between the Company and a nonaffiliate to sell such security is also assigned to the lender at the time a participation certificate is sold. The purchase price paid by the lender for each participation certificate is based on the trade price of the security, plus an amount of interest expected to accrue on the security to its anticipated delivery date, minus a present value adjustment, any related hedging costs and a holdback amount. The holdback amount is based on a percentage of the purchase price and is not required to be paid to the Company until the settlement of the security and its delivery to the lender.

Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company may be involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The amount, if any, of ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, but despite the inherent uncertainties of litigation, management believes that the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings and exposure will not have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, income, or cash flows of the Company. Litigation On June 14, 2024, a purported shareholder of the Company s Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares (each, as defined hereafter) filed a complaint in a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, captioned Roberto Verthelyi v. PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust and PNMAC Capital Management, LLC, Case No. 2:24-cv-05028 (the Verthelyi Action ). The Verthelyi Action alleges, among other things, that the Company (and its external investment advisor, PCM), committed unlawful and unfair acts in violation of California s Unfair Competition Law by replacing its floating three-month London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") dividend rate for the Series A and Series B Preferred Shares with a fixed rate, in violation of the LIBOR Act, 12 U.S.C. 5801 et seq., and the LIBOR Rule, 12 C.F.R. 253 et seq. The Verthelyi Action seeks injunctive relief requiring the Company to implement SOFR as a replacement to the three-month LIBOR rate and damages for the putative class in the form of restitution, interest, disgorgement and other relief. The Company believes it has interpreted the Articles Supplementary to its Series A and Series B Preferred Shares consistent with their terms and, more specifically, the interest rate fallback provisions contained therein, as applied under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR rules, and that the Verthelyi Action is without merit. Accordingly, while no assurance can be provided as to the ultimate outcome of this claim, the Company and PCM plan to vigorously defend the matter. Pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2020, by and between the Company and PCM, the Company has assumed the defense of PCM in the Verthelyi Action. The Company and PCM each filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on August 20, 2024.

The Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares will not be redeemable before August 24, 2026, except in connection with the Company s qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or upon the occurrence of a change of control. On or after the date the preferred shares become redeemable, or 120 days after the first date on which such change of control occurs, the Company may, at its option, redeem any or all of the preferred shares at per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date. preferred shares were redeemed during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

and with consolidated pretax income of million and million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s taxable REIT subsidiary TRS recognized a tax benefit of million on a pretax loss of million and tax benefit of million on a pretax loss of million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the same periods in 2023, the TRS recognized a tax expense of million on pretax income of million and tax expense of million on pretax income of million. The Company s reported consolidated pretax income was million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The primary difference between the Company s effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is generally attributable to nontaxable REIT income resulting from the dividends paid deduction. The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, the valuation allowance remains . The conclusion was primarily based on the fact that the TRS has reported cumulative GAAP income over the last three-year period ended September 30, 2024. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods based on future income. In general, cash dividends declared by the Company will be considered ordinary income to the shareholders for income tax purposes. Some portion of the dividends may be characterized as capital gain distributions or a return of capital. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (subject to certain limitations) provides a deduction from taxable income for ordinary REIT dividends.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Report are made as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking statements. 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated income and financial condition. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this Report to the words we, us, our and the Company refer to PMT and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Our Co mpany 
 We are a specialty finance company that invests in mortgage-related assets. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. A significant portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage-related assets that we have created through our correspondent production activities, including mortgage servicing rights MSRs ), subordinate mortgage-backed securities MBS ), and credit risk transfer CRT arrangements, which absorb credit losses on certain of the loans we have sold. We also invest in Agency and senior non-Agency MBS, subordinate credit-linked MBS and interest-only ("IO") and principal-only ("PO") stripped MBS. We have also historically invested in distressed mortgage assets (distressed loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans REO )), which we have substantially liquidated. 
 We are externally managed by PNMAC Capital Management, LLC PCM ), an investment adviser that specializes in and focuses on U.S. mortgage-related assets. Our loans and MSRs are serviced by PennyMac Loan Services, LLC PLS ). PCM and PLS are both wholly-owned subsidiaries of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. PFSI ), a publicly-traded mortgage banking and investment management company separately listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 We operate our business in four segments: Credit sensitive strategies, Interest rate sensitive strategies, Correspondent production and our Corporate operations, as described below: 
 The credit sensitive strategies segment represents our investments in CRT arrangements referencing loans from our own correspondent production and subordinate MBS. 

The interest rate sensitive strategies segment represents our investments in MSRs, Agency and senior non-Agency MBS and the related interest rate hedging activities. 

The correspondent production segment represents our operations aimed at serving as an intermediary between lenders and the capital markets by purchasing, pooling and reselling newly originated prime credit quality loans either directly or in the form of MBS, using the services of PCM and PLS. 

We primarily sell the loans we acquire through our correspondent production activities to government-sponsored entities ("GSEs") such as the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac or to PLS for sale into securitizations guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"), or the GSEs. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae are each referred to as an Agency and, collectively, as the Agencies. 
 The corporate segment includes management fees, corporate expense amounts and certain interest income and expense. 

Our Investment Activities 
 Credit Sensitive Investments 
 CRT Arrangements 
 We have previously entered into loan sales arrangements with Fannie Mae pursuant to which we accepted credit risk relating to the loans sold in exchange for a portion of the interest earned on such loans. These arrangements absorb scheduled or realized credit losses on those loans and comprise the Company s investments in CRT arrangements. 
 57 

We held net CRT-related investments (comprised of deposits securing CRT arrangements, CRT derivatives, CRT strips and an interest-only security payable) totaling approximately 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 Subordinate Credit-Linked Mortgage-Backed Securities 
 Subordinate credit-linked MBS provide us with a higher yield than senior MBS securities. However, we incur credit risk in the subordinate credit-linked MBS since they are the first securities to absorb credit losses relating to the underlying loans. We sold approximately 111.0 million of our holdings of subordinate credit-linked MBS during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We held subordinate credit-linked MBS with fair values totaling approximately 196.3 million at September 30, 2024. 
 As the result of the Company s consolidation of the variable interest entities that issued certain of the subordinate MBS as described in Note 6 Variable Interest Entities Subordinate Mortgage-Backed Securities to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report, we include loans underlying these and similar transactions with unpaid principal balances UPBs totaling approximately 1.6 billion on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Sensitive Investments 
 Our interest rate sensitive investments include: 
 Mortgage servicing rights. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received approximately 159.5 million of MSRs as proceeds from sales of loans acquired for sale. We held approximately 3.8 billion of MSRs at fair value at 

September 30, 2024. 
 REIT-eligible Agency, senior non-Agency, and Agency IO and PO stripped MBS. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased approximately 516.0 million of Agency PO stripped and IO stripped MBS and sold 869.4 million of fixed-rate pass-through securities and IO stripped MBS. We held Agency fixed-rate pass-through, senior non-Agency, and Agency IO stripped and PO stripped MBS with fair values totaling approximately 4.0 billion at September 30, 2024. 

Correspondent Production 
 Our correspondent production activities involve the acquisition and sale of newly originated prime credit quality residential loans. Correspondent production has served as the source of our investments in MSRs, private label non-Agency securitizations and CRT arrangements. Our correspondent production and resulting investment activity are summarized below:

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased newly originated prime credit quality residential loans with fair values totaling 67.9 billion as compared to 63.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in our correspondent production business. To the extent that we purchase loans that are insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through the Federal Housing Administration, or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or U.S. Department of Agriculture, we and PLS have agreed that PLS will fulfill and purchase such loans, as PLS is a Ginnie Mae approved issuer and we are not. This arrangement has enabled us to compete with other correspondent aggregators that purchase both government and conventional loans. We may also sell conventional loans that we purchase to PLS subject to our and PLS's mutual agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 30.2 billion and 26.3 billion UPB of government guaranteed or insured loans and conventional loans, respectively, to PLS in order to optimize our use and allocation of capital. 
 Our purchase volume included 57.5 billion and 50.8 billion of loans we sold to PLS during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We receive a sourcing fee from PLS based on the UPB of each loan that we sell to PLS under such arrangement, and earn interest income on the loan for the period we hold it before the sale to PLS. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received sourcing fees totaling 5.6 million, relating to 56.5 billion, in UPB of loans that we sold to PLS. 
 58 

Taxation 
 We believe that we qualify to be taxed as a REIT and as such will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our income that is distributed to shareholders as long as we meet applicable REIT asset, income and share ownership tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our profits will be subject to income taxes and we may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the four tax years following the year we lose our REIT qualification. 
 A portion of our activities, including our correspondent production business, is conducted in our taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ), which is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes. Accordingly, we make a provision for income taxes with respect to the operations of our TRS. We expect that the effective rate for the provision for income taxes may be volatile in future periods. Our goal is to manage the business to take full advantage of the tax benefits afforded to us as a REIT. 
 We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence using a more-likely-than-not standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. Our evaluation considers, among other factors, taxable loss carryback availability, expectations of sufficient future taxable income, trends in earnings, existence of taxable income in recent years, the future reversal of temporary differences, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented, if required. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which the related deferred tax assets become deductible. 
 Non-Cash Investment Income 
 A substantial portion of our net investment income is comprised of non-cash items, including fair value adjustments and recognition of the fair value of assets created and liabilities incurred in loan sales transactions. Because we have elected, or are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), to record certain of our financial assets (comprised of MBS, loans acquired for sale at fair value, loans at fair value and CRT strips), our derivatives, our MSRs, and our asset-backed financings and interest-only security payable at fair value, a substantial portion of the income or loss we record with respect to such assets and liabilities results from non-cash changes in fair value. 
 The amounts of net non-cash investment income items included in net investment income are as follows:

Results of Operations 
 Business Trends 
 The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun to reduce the federal funds rate from its highest level since 2007 as inflationary pressures have abated, and longer term interest rates have declined slightly from their most elevated levels in recent years. Elevated interest rates have constrained growth in the size of the mortgage origination market from 1.5 trillion in 2023 to an estimated 1.7 trillion in 2024, but forecasted declining interest rates are projected to increased the refinancing activity and are projected to drive the origination market higher to 2.3 trillion in 2025, according to mortgage origination economists. 
 Declining interest rates and increasing opportunity for refinancing in recent periods have driven increased mortgage production activity in the most recent quarter, and also led to increasing prepayment speeds on our mortgage servicing portfolio from the historically slow prepayment speeds experienced earlier in the year. Higher interest rate levels have increased the costs of floating rate borrowings and interest income from placement fees we receive relating to custodial funds that we manage on deposits and loans held for sale as compared to the same period in the prior year, although we would expect these to begin declining as well as if the Federal Reserve reduces the federal funds rate as expected. We have also continued our sales of conventional loans to PLS during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we intend to continue to sell a portion of our conventional loans to PLS throughout the remainder of 2024 to optimize our use and allocation of capital. 
 The recent period of inflationary pressure and elevated interest rates may also lead to a reduction in economic activity and slowing home price growth or depreciation, which could lead to increasing mortgage delinquencies or defaults and increased losses. If these effects are realized, they could negatively affect the performance of our credit-sensitive assets such as our CRT arrangements or subordinate credit-linked notes and increase losses from our representations and warranties. However, many of the loans underlying our assets have favorable credit characteristics including low loan-to-value ratios, which are likely to help moderate the negative effects of credit performance in an economic downturn. 
 We are aggregating Agency eligible non-owner occupied loans and evaluating investment opportunities in the private label securitization market.

(1) Includes net gains on sales of loans and loan origination fees. 

Our consolidated net income decreased by 20.0 million and 32.3 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflecting the fair value performance of our MSRs and reduced CRT-related investment gains, offset by increased gains on MBS and benefits from income taxes. 
 
 The decreases in the quarterly and nine months pretax results are summarized below: 
 Our credit sensitive strategies segment recognized a 9.3 million and 47.8 million decrease in net gains on our CRT arrangements during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as market credit spreads tightened less compared to the same periods in 2023. 

Our interest rate sensitive strategies segment recognized a 366.4 million and 309.3 million decrease in net servicing fees during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, resulting from increased net MSR valuation losses compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, caused by a decrease in market interest rates during the periods in 2024. These decreases were partially offset by a 277.7 million and 218.4 million increase in valuation gains on MBS and hedging derivatives during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as well as a 20.1 million and 31.6 million decrease in net interest expense. 

Our correspondent production segment recognized a 6.5 million and 22.3 million increase in our net gains on sales of loans during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, reflecting increased gain on sale margins for mortgage loans and a reduction of our liability for representations and warranties due to the effects of certain loans reaching specified performance histories identified by the Agencies as sufficient to limit repurchase claims relating to such loans.

The increase in net gains on investments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to improved performance from our investments in MBS as interest rates decreased, partially offset by reduced gains in our CRT arrangements as credit spreads did not tighten as much as during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities 
 During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net valuation gains of 123.4 million and 50.3 million, respectively, as compared to net valuation losses of 144.0 million and 127.4 million for the same periods in 2023. 
 The increased gains recognized during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 reflect decreasing interest rates during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to increasing interest rates during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Loans at Fair Value Held in VIEs and Asset-Backed Financings at Fair Value 
 Loans at fair value held in VIEs and Asset-backed financings at fair value recorded combined net valuation gains of 2.4 million and 7.2 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net valuation gains of 4.4 million and 4.8 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net gain during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects the effect of credit spread tightening (a decrease in the interest rate premium demanded by investors for instruments over those that are considered risk free ), on our net investments secured by jumbo loans and investment properties, as well as the effect of decreasing interest rates.

The changes in Net gains on loans acquired for sale during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, reflect increased gain on sale margins for mortgage loans supplemented by the effect of a reduction in our liability for representations and warranties. 
 Non-cash elements of gain on sale of loans: 
 Interest Rate Lock Commitments 
 Our Net gains on loans acquired for sale include our estimates of gains or losses we expect to realize upon the sale of mortgage loans we have committed to purchase but have not yet purchased or sold. Therefore, we recognize a substantial portion of our net gains before we purchase the loans. These gains are reflected on our balance sheet as IRLC derivative assets and liabilities. We adjust the fair values of our IRLCs as the loan acquisition process progresses until we complete the acquisitions or the commitments are canceled. Such adjustments are included in our Net gains on loans acquired for sale . The fair values of our IRLCs becomes part of the carrying values of our loans when we complete the purchases of the loans. The methods and key inputs we use to measure the fair values of IRLCs are summarized in Note 7 Fair value Valuation Techniques and Inputs to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 64 

The MSRs and liabilities for representations and warranties we recognize represent our estimate of the fair value of future benefits and costs we will realize for years in the future. These estimates change as circumstances change, and changes in these estimates are recognized in our income in subsequent periods. Subsequent changes in the fair value of our MSRs significantly affect our income. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights 
 The methods we use to measure and update the measurements of our MSRs as well as the effect of changes in valuation inputs on MSR fair value are detailed in Note 7 Fair value Valuation Techniques and Inputs to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 Liability for Losses Under Representations and Warranties 
 We recognize liabilities for losses we expect to incur relating to the representations and warranties we provide to purchasers in our loan sales transactions. The representations and warranties we provide require adherence to purchaser and insurer origination and underwriting guidelines, including but not limited to the validity of the lien securing the loan, property eligibility, borrower credit, income and asset requirements, and compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. 
 In the event of a breach of our representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loans with the identified defects or indemnify the investor or insurer against credit losses attributable to the loans with indemnified defects. In such cases, we bear any subsequent credit losses on the loans. Our credit losses may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent sellers that, in turn, had sold such loans to us and breached similar or other representations and warranties. In such event, we have the right to seek a recovery of those repurchase losses from that correspondent seller. 
 We recorded a provision for losses relating to representations and warranties relating to loan sales of 459,000 and 917,000, respectively, for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 448,000 and 2.1 million, respectively, for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

65 

The losses on representations and warranties we have recorded to date have been moderated by our ability to recover most of the losses inherent in the repurchased loans from the correspondent sellers. As the outstanding balance of loans we purchase and sell subject to representations and warranties increases, as the loans outstanding season, as our investors and guarantors loss mitigation strategies change and as our correspondent sellers ability and willingness to repurchase loans change, we expect that the level of repurchase activity and associated losses may increase. 
 The method we use to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of our estimates of future defaults, loan repurchase rates, severities of loss in the event of default and the probabilities of reimbursement by the correspondent loan sellers. We establish a liability at our estimate of its fair value at the time loans are sold and review our liability estimate on a periodic basis and adjust the liability for estimated losses in excess of the recorded liability. 
 The amount of the liability for representations and warranties is difficult to estimate and requires considerable judgment. The level of loan repurchase losses is dependent on economic factors, investor loss mitigation strategies, our ability to recover any losses inherent in the repurchased loan from the correspondent seller and other external conditions that change over the lives of the underlying loans. We may be required to incur losses related to such representations and warranties for several periods after the loans are sold or liquidated. 
 We record adjustments to our liability for losses on representations and warranties as economic fundamentals change, as investor and Agency evaluations of their loss mitigation strategies (including claims under representations and warranties) change and as economic conditions affect our correspondent sellers ability or willingness to fulfill their recourse obligations to us. Such adjustments may be material to our financial position and income in future periods. 
 Adjustments to our liability for representations and warranties are included as a component of our Net gains on loans acquired for sale at fair value . We recorded 5.2 million and 18.6 million reductions in the liability for representations and warranties during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 4.4 million and 7.9 during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to the effects of certain loans reaching specified performance histories identified by the Agencies as sufficient to limit repurchase claims relating to such loans. 
 Loan Origination Fees 
 Loan origination fees represent fees we charge correspondent sellers relating to our purchase of loans from those sellers. Loan origination fees increased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, as we purchased more loans for sale to nonaffiliates during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Loan origination fees decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting the overall decrease in our purchase volume of loans for sale to nonaffiliates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net Loan Servicing Fees 
 Our net loan servicing fees have two primary components: fees earned for servicing loans and the effects of MSR valuation changes, net of hedging results, as summarized below:

Loan servicing fees that relate to our MSRs are primarily related to servicing we provide for loans included in Agency securitizations. These fees are contractually established at an annualized percentage of the UPB of the loans serviced and we collect 
 66 

these fees from borrower payments. Other loan servicing fees are comprised primarily of borrower-contracted fees, such as late charges and reconveyance fees, and incentive fees we receive from the Agencies for loss mitigation activities as well as fees we charge to correspondent lenders for loans repaid by the borrower shortly after purchase. 
 The change in contractually-specified fees during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, is due primarily to a slight reduction in our MSR servicing portfolio, reflecting the shift of a portion of our loan sales from third party sales with servicing rights retained to sales to PLS which include the transfer of servicing rights to PLS. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights and Hedging 
 We have elected to carry our servicing assets at fair value. Changes in fair value have two components: changes due to realization of the servicing cashflows and changes due to changes in inputs used to estimate fair value. We endeavor to moderate the effects of changes in fair value attributable to changes in fair value inputs (market conditions) primarily by entering into derivatives transactions. 
 Changes in fair value of MSRs and hedging results are summarized below:

Changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs used in our valuation model during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect the effects of expectations for faster future prepayments of the underlying loans. 
 The decrease in loan recapture income from PFSI reflects the decrease in refinancing activity in our MSR portfolio during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. We have an agreement with PFSI that allows us to receive a recapture fee when PFSI refinances a loan for which we held the MSRs. The MSR recapture agreement is summarized in Note 4 Transactions with Related Parties Operating Activities to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 Hedging results reflect valuation losses in hedges against interest rate changes during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that are attributable to the effects of interest rate volatility and elevated hedge costs on the fair value of the hedging instruments. Hedging results reflect valuation losses in hedges against interest rates during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, that are attributable to the effects of interest rate volatility and elevated hedge costs on the fair value of the hedging instruments. PMT s hedging activities are intended to manage its net exposure across all interest rate sensitive strategies, which include MSRs, MBS and related tax impacts. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the loss in net loan servicing fees due to changes in valuation inputs to the valuation model and hedging results due to interest rate decreases and volatility, along with related tax impacts, were largely offset by gains on mortgage-backed securities recorded in net investment income also due to the effect of decreasing interest rates. 
 Changes in realization of cash flows are influenced by changes in the level of servicing assets and liabilities and changes in estimates of remaining cash flows to be realized.

The decrease in net interest expense during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, is due to yields on our interest-earning assets increasing more than the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities and the increase in earnings from placement fees relating to custodial funds managed for borrowers and investors.

Income Taxes 
 We have elected to treat PennyMac Corp. PMC ), as a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ). Income from a TRS is only included as a component of REIT taxable income to the extent that the TRS makes dividend distributions of income to us. A TRS is subject to corporate federal and state income tax. Accordingly, a provision for income taxes for PMC is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
 The Company s effective tax rate was (56.1) and (30.8) with consolidated pretax income of 26.5 million and 87.5 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s TRS recognized a tax benefit of 15.5 million on a pretax loss of 64.7 million and tax benefit of 27.5 million on a pretax loss of 115.6 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the same periods in 2023, the TRS recognized a tax expense of 57.1 million on pretax income of 234.0 million and a tax expense of 56.5 million on pretax income of 221.9 million. The Company s reported consolidated pretax income was 118.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The primary difference between the Company s effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is generally attributable to nontaxable REIT income resulting from the dividends paid deduction. 
 The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, the valuation allowance remains zero as a result of cumulative GAAP income at the TRS for the three-year period ended September 30, 2024. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods based on future income. 
 In general, cash dividends declared by the Company will be considered ordinary income to the shareholders for income tax purposes. Some portion of the dividends may be characterized as capital gain distributions or a return of capital. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (subject to certain limitations) provides a 20 deduction from taxable income for ordinary REIT dividends.

Our acquisitions during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were financed through the use of a combination of proceeds from borrowings and liquidations of existing investments. We continue to identify additional means of increasing our investment portfolio through cash flow from our business activities, existing investments, borrowings, and transactions that minimize current cash outlays. However, we expect that, over time, our ability to continue our investment portfolio growth will depend on our ability to raise additional equity capital.

Cash flows from loans acquired for sale primarily reflect changes in the level of inventory from the beginning to end of the periods presented. Our inventory of loans held for sale increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a decrease during the same period in 2023. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash provided by our investing activities was 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by our investing activities of 60.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our net sale of MBS. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash provided by our financing activities was 67.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in our financing activities of 743.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change primarily reflects relative stability in the size of our balance sheet during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources , our Manager continually evaluates and pursues additional sources of financing to provide us with future investing capacity. We do not raise equity or enter into borrowings for the purpose of financing the payment of dividends. We believe that our cash earnings are adequate to fund our operating expenses and dividend payment requirements. However, we manage our liquidity in the aggregate and are reinvesting our cash flows in new investments as well as using such cash to fund our dividend requirements. 
 76 

Liquidity and Ca pital Resources 
 Our liquidity reflects our ability to meet our current obligations (including the purchase of loans from correspondent sellers, our operating expenses and, when applicable, retirement of, and margin calls relating to, our debt and derivatives positions), make investments as our Manager identifies them, pursue our share repurchase program and make distributions to our shareholders. We generally need to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income each year (subject to certain adjustments) to our shareholders to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. This distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital to support our activities. 
 We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flows from our investment portfolio, including cash earnings on our investments, cash flows from business activities, liquidation of existing investments and proceeds from borrowings and/or additional equity offerings. When we finance a particular asset, the amount borrowed is less than the asset s fair value and we must provide the cash in the amount of such difference. Our ability to continue making investments is dependent on our ability to invest the cash representing such difference. 
 On March 15, 2024, the Company, PMT ISSUER TRUST-FMSR and PMT CO-ISSUER TRUST-FMSR (together, the "Issuer Trusts"), PMT and PennyMac Holdings, LLC PMH entered into a Series 2024-VF1 Note with Goldman Sachs Bank, USA, as part of the structured finance transaction that PMC uses to finance Fannie Mae mortgage servicing rights and related excess servicing spread and servicing advance receivables. The initial two-year term of the Series 2024-VF1 Note is set to expire on March 15, 2026, at which point the Series 2024-VF1 Note amortizes over 12 months prior to termination. 
 On April 4, 2024, we issued in a private offering 247 million aggregate principal amount of CRT term notes that mature on March 29, 2027 at a rate of 3.35 over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. 
 On May 24, 2024 and June 4, 2024, PMC issued in a private offering 216.5 million aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Exchangeable Notes that mature on June 1, 2029 at a rate of 8.500 per year. The 2029 Exchangeable Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PMT. Upon exchange, PMC will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be exchanged and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, PMT s common shares of beneficial interest Common Shares ), or a combination thereof, at PMT s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be exchanged. The exchange rate initially equals 63.3332 Common Shares per 1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Exchangeable Notes. 
 On June 27, 2024, the Company, the Issuer Trusts, PMC and PMH issued an aggregate principal amount of 355 million in secured term notes (the Series 2024-FT1 Term Notes as part of the structured finance transaction that PMC and PMH use to finance Fannie Mae mortgage servicing rights and related excess servicing spread and servicing advance receivables. The initial 3.5 year term of the Series 2024-FT1 Term Notes is set to mature on December 27, 2027, unless the Company exercises a six-month optional extension. 
 Debt Financing 
 Our current debt financing strategy is to finance our assets where we believe such borrowing is prudent, appropriate and available. We make collateralized borrowings in the form of sales of assets under agreements to repurchase, loan participation purchase and sale agreements and notes payable, including secured term financing for our MSRs and our CRT arrangements that have allowed us to match the term of our borrowings more closely to the expected lives of the assets securing those borrowings. We have also borrowed money by issuing unsecured senior notes.

Sales of Assets Under Agreements to Repurchase 
 Our repurchase agreements represent the sales of assets together with agreements for us to buy back the assets at a later date. Following is a summary of the activities in our repurchase agreements financing:

6,020,716 

The difference between the maximum and average daily amounts outstanding is primarily due to timing of loan purchases and sales in our correspondent production business. The total facility size of our Assets sold under agreements to repurchase was approximately 11.3 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 Because a significant portion of our current debt facilities consists of short-term borrowings, we expect to either renew these facilities in advance of maturity in order to ensure our ongoing liquidity and access to capital or otherwise allow ourselves sufficient time to replace any necessary financing. 
 As discussed above, all of our repurchase agreements, and mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements have short-term maturities: 
 The transactions relating to loans and REO under agreements to repurchase generally provide for terms of approximately one to two years; 

The transactions relating to loans under mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements provide for terms of approximately one year; 

The transactions relating to assets under notes payable provide for terms ranging from two to five years; and 

All repurchase agreements that matured between September 30, 2024 and the date of this Report have been renewed, extended or replaced.

Unsecured Senior Notes 
 In September 2023, we issued 53.5 million principal amount of our unsecured 8.50 senior notes due September 30, 2028 (the 2028 Senior Notes ). The 2028 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.50 per year payable quarterly. 
 On or after September 30, 2025, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2028 Senior Notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund will be provided for the 2028 Senior Notes. 
 The 2028 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PMC, including the due and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the 2028 Senior Notes, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise (the PMC Guarantee ). PMC s operations and investing activities are centered in residential mortgage-related assets, including the creation of and investment in MSRs. 
 Under the terms of the PMC Guarantee, holders of the 2028 Senior Notes will not be required to exercise their remedies against us before they proceed directly against PMC. PMC s obligations under the guarantee are limited to the maximum amount that will not, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of PMC, result in the guarantee constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. The PMC Guarantee will: 
 rank equal in right of payment to any of PMC s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and guarantees of PMC; 

be effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of PMC s existing and future secured indebtedness and secured guarantees to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness or guarantees; and 

be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) and (to the extent not held by PMC) preferred stock, if any, of PMC s subsidiaries and of any entity PMC accounts for using the equity method of accounting.

Debt Covenants 
 Our debt financing agreements require us and certain of our subsidiaries to comply with various financial covenants. As of the filing of this Report, these financial covenants include the following: 
 a minimum of 75 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents among the Company and/or our subsidiaries; a minimum of 75 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents among our Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries; a minimum of 25 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents between PMC and PMH; a minimum of 25 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at PMC; and a minimum of 10 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at PMH; 

a minimum tangible net worth for the Company of 1.25 billion; a minimum tangible net worth for our Operating Partnership of 1.25 billion; a minimum tangible net worth for PMH of 250 million; and a minimum tangible net worth for PMC of 300 million; 

a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to tangible net worth of less than 10:1 for PMC and PMH and 10:1 for the Company and our Operating Partnership; and 

at least two warehouse or repurchase facilities that finance amounts and assets similar to those being financed under our existing debt financing agreements. 

Although these financial covenants limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur and impact our liquidity through minimum cash reserve requirements, we believe that these covenants currently provide us with sufficient flexibility to successfully operate our business and obtain the financing necessary to achieve that purpose. 
 80 

PLS is also subject to various financial covenants, both as a borrower under its own financing arrangements and as our servicer under certain of our debt financing agreements. The most significant of these financial covenants currently include the following: 
 a minimum in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 100 million; 

a minimum tangible net worth of 1.25 billion; 

a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to tangible net worth of 10:1; and 

at least one other warehouse or repurchase facility that finances amounts and assets that are similar to those being financed under certain of our existing secured financing agreements. 

Many of our debt financing agreements contain a condition precedent to obtaining additional funding that requires us to maintain positive net income for at least one (1) of the previous two consecutive quarters, or other similar measures. For the most recent fiscal quarter, the Company is compliant with all such conditions. However, we may be required to obtain waivers from certain lenders in the future if this condition precedent is not met. 
 Our debt financing agreements also contain margin call provisions that, upon notice from the applicable lender at its option, require us to transfer cash or, in some instances, additional assets in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. A margin deficit will generally result from any decline in the market value (as determined by the applicable lender) of the assets subject to the related financing agreement, although in some instances we may agree with the lender upon certain thresholds (in dollar amounts or percentages based on the market value of the assets) that must be exceeded before a margin deficit will arise. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice. 
 Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements 
 In addition to the financial covenants imposed upon us and PLS as our servicer under our debt financing agreements, we, through PMC and/or PLS, as applicable, are also subject to liquidity and net worth requirements established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA for Agency seller/servicers and Ginnie Mae for single-family issuers. FHFA and Ginnie Mae have established minimum liquidity and net worth requirements for their approved non-depository single-family sellers/servicers in the case of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae for its approved single-family issuers. 
 Ginnie Mae has issued risk-based capital requirements which will be effective December 31, 2024. We believe that our servicer is in compliance with the Agency's pending requirements as of September 30, 2024. 
 We continue to explore a variety of additional means of financing our business, including debt financing through bank warehouse lines of credit, repurchase agreements, term financing, securitization transactions and unsecured debt and equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance as to how much additional financing capacity such efforts will produce, what form the financing will take or that such efforts will be successful. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Our management, servicing, and loan fulfillment fee agreements are described in Note 4 Transactions with Related Parties to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 All debt financing arrangements that matured between September 30, 2024 and the date of this Report have been renewed, extended or replaced. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain of these estimates significantly influence the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies primarily relate to our fair value estimates. 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies, which utilize relevant critical accounting estimates. 
 81 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, real estate values and other market-based risks. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, inflation risk and market value risk. 
 Our primary trading asset is our inventory of loans acquired for sale. We believe that such assets fair values respond primarily to changes in the market interest rates for comparable recently-originated loans. Our other market-risk assets are a substantial portion of our investments and are primarily comprised of MSRs, CRT arrangements and MBS. We believe that the fair values of MSRs and MBS also respond primarily to changes in the market interest rates for comparable loans or yields on MBS. Changes in interest rates are reflected in the prepayment speeds underlying these investments and in the pricing spread (an element of the discount rate) used in their valuation. We believe that the primary market risks to the fair values of our investment in CRT arrangements are changes in market credit spreads and the fair value of the real estate securing the loans underlying such arrangements. 
 The following sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time; only contemplate the movements in the indicated variables; do not incorporate changes to other variables; are subject to the accuracy of various models and assumptions used; and do not incorporate other factors that would affect our overall financial performance in such scenarios, including operational adjustments made by management to account for changing circumstances. For these reasons, the following estimates should not be viewed as earnings forecasts. 
 Mortgage-backed securities at fair value

Sectio n 2.02	 Procedure for Entering into Transactions .

Each Transaction Notice on any Purchase Date shall be in an amount equal to at least 500,000. 
 (b)	If a Seller shall deliver a Transaction Notice to the Buyers that satisfies the requirements of Section 2.02(a) and all applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article V have been satisfied or waived by each Buyer on or prior to the Purchase Date, then subject to the foregoing, on the Purchase Date, each Buyer shall remit its Pro Rata Share of the requested Purchase Price in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds to Administrative Agent at the account specified in Schedule 3 (or such other account designated in writing by Administrative Agent) no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date specified in the Transaction Notice as the Purchase Date, and upon satisfaction or waiver of all applicable conditions set forth herein, Administrative Agent shall deposit such proceeds into the account of the applicable Parent specified in Schedule 5 of the Base Indenture (or such other account designated by Sellers in the Transaction Notice) not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Purchase Date. 
 (c)	The failure of any Buyer to advance the proceeds of its Pro Rata Share of any Transaction required to be advanced hereunder shall not relieve any other Buyer of its obligation to advance the proceeds of its Pro Rata Share of any such Transaction required to be advanced hereunder. 
 (d)	If a Buyer does not intend to fund its Pro Rata Share of the requested Purchase Price, such Buyer shall, within one (1) Business Day of the related Purchase Date, notify Administrative Agent, the other Buyers and Sellers of its intent not to fund together with a description of the reason for not remitting its Pro Rata Share of the requested Purchase Price. 
 (e)	The liabilities and obligations of each Buyer hereunder shall be several and not joint, and neither Administrative Agent nor any Buyer shall be responsible for the performance by any other Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Each Buyer shall be liable to Sellers only for the amount of its respective Committed Amount.

 - 17 - 

but only to the extent that (x) such non Defaulting Buyer has consented to such reallocation, (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Committed Amount held by any non Defaulting Buyer to exceed such non Defaulting Buyer s Committed Amount and (z) to the extent required in writing by Administrative Agent, Sellers shall confirm that the conditions set forth in this Section 2.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation. 
 (f)	To the extent that the Defaulting Buyer thereafter funds such Defaulting Buyer Deficiency with Price Differential thereon, if applicable, then upon the agreement between Sellers and the Administrative Agent, such Buyer shall no longer be a Defaulting Buyer. If Sellers and Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Buyer is no longer a Defaulting Buyer, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Buyer will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Purchase Price of the other Buyers or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Purchase Prices to be held on a pro rata basis by the Buyers in accordance with their Committed Amount, whereupon such Buyer will cease to be a Defaulting Buyer; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Sellers while that Buyer was a Defaulting Buyer; provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Buyer to Buyer will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Buyer s having been a Defaulting Buyer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Base Indenture, no Event of Default shall arise in connection with any breach by a Seller of the foregoing sentence unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have provided written notice of such 
 - 18 - 

breach to each Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing stated in this Section 2.03(d) , (i) limits the Sellers obligations to pay Repurchase Price, any Margin Calls or other obligations as set forth in this Agreement from funds other than Collections on the Participation Certificates or (ii)(a) obligates the Administrative Agent to monitor Sellers adherence to the above limitation, (b) limits the obligation of the Sellers to deposit all collections, payments and proceeds in respect of the Note into the Administrative Agent Account as required by Section 2.06 or (c) restricts or limits the right of the Administrative Agent to apply funds in the Administrative Agent Account in accordance with Section 2.07 , to the extents amounts due and payable are not otherwise paid directly by the Sellers with funds that do not constitute Collections.

 Sec tion 2.05	 Margin Maintenance . 
 (a)	If at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of the Purchase Price of the Note is greater than the Margin Market Value or the Maximum Purchase Price for the related Transaction (such excess, a Margin Deficit ), then Administrative Agent shall, unless waived by all Buyers, by notice to Sellers require Sellers to transfer to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Buyers, cash in an amount at least equal to the Margin Deficit (such requirement, a Margin Call ).

waive Administrative Agent s rights under this Agreement or otherwise existing by law or in any way create additional rights for the Sellers. 
 (c)	In the event that a Margin Deficit exists, Administrative Agent may retain any funds received by it to which the Sellers would otherwise be entitled hereunder, which funds (i) may be held by Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Buyers, against the related Margin Deficit or (ii) may be applied by Administrative Agent against the Purchase Price.

 Sect ion 11.13	 Intent . 
 (a)	The parties recognize that each Transaction is a master netting agreement as that term is defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended and a securities contract as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended and that all payments hereunder are deemed margin payments or settlement payments as defined in Title 11 of the United States Code. 
 (b)	It is understood that either party s right to liquidate Purchased Assets delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to Section 4.07 , 7.03 or 11.12 hereof is a contractual right to liquidate such Transaction as described in Sections 555 and Section 561 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended. 
 (c)	The parties agree and acknowledge that if a party hereto is an insured depository institution, as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended FDIA ), then each Transaction hereunder is a qualified financial contract, as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable). 
 (d)	It is understood that this Agreement constitutes a netting contract as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 FDICIA and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a covered contractual payment entitlement or covered contractual 
 - 78 - 

payment obligation , respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as one or both of the parties is not a financial institution as that term is defined in FDICIA). 
 (e)	This Agreement is intended to be a securities contract, within the meaning of Section 555 under the Bankruptcy Code, and a master netting agreement, within the meaning of Section 561 under the Bankruptcy Code. 
 (f)	It is the intention of the parties that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes and for accounting purposes, each Transaction constitute a financing, and that Sellers be (except to the extent that Administrative Agent shall have exercised its remedies following an Event of Default) the owner of the Purchased Assets for such purposes. Unless prohibited by applicable Law, Administrative Agent, Seller Parties and Buyers shall treat the Transactions as described in the preceding sentence (including on any and all filings with any U.S. federal, state, or local taxing authority and agree not to take any action inconsistent with such treatment). 
 Sect ion 11.14	 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs . To the extent that the Program Agreements provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for derivative contracts or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support QFC Credit Support and each such QFC a Supported QFC ), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the U .S. Special Resolution Regime in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Transaction Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): 
 In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Program Agreements that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Program Agreements were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Buyer shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
