components a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and incentive fee is ultimately borne by the Company s stockholders. 
 Base Management Fee 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average adjusted gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds. For services rendered under the Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of its two most recently completed calendar quarters. Such amount is appropriately adjusted (based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter) for any share issuances or repurchases during a calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro-rated. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee, which provides the Adviser with a share of the income it generates for the Company, consists of components net investment income and net capital gains which are largely independent of each other, and may result in one component being payable in a given period even if the other is not payable. 
 Under the investment income component, the Company pays the Adviser each quarter of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the quarter exceeds a hurdle rate of annualized) of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a catch-up provision pursuant to which the Adviser receives all of such income in excess of but less than , subject to a total return requirement. The effect of the catch-up provision is that, subject to the total return provision discussed below, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter, the Adviser receives of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent that of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC. In other words, any investment income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the hurdle, subject to the catch-up provision and (ii) (x) of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the sum of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC. The Company elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act on March 5, 2014. 
 Under the capital gains component of the incentive fee, the Company pays the Adviser at the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement) of the Company s aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of that year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement), computed net of aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized losses through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the foregoing purpose, the Company s aggregate cumulative realized capital gains does not include any unrealized gains. It should be noted that the Company accrues an incentive fee for accounting purposes taking into account any unrealized gains in accordance with GAAP. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee is payable for such year. Additionally, if the Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee.

of the total dollar value of the Company s investment portfolio will receive valuation recommendations from an independent third-party valuation firm each quarter, as selected in accordance with the Company s valuation policy. Each new portfolio investment will be reviewed by an independent third-party valuation firm within months of the date of investment, and thereafter will be reviewed by an independent third-party valuation firm no later than the fourth quarter following its most recent inclusion in such review process. However, a valuation review by an independent third-party valuation firm is not required for an investment whose total dollar value is less than of the total dollar value of the Company s aggregate investment portfolio (up to an aggregate of of the total dollar value of the Company s aggregate investment portfolio) or for those assets that the Board and/or Valuation Committee has agreed to waive from such requirement. 
 The Adviser and the independent third-party valuation firms, if applicable, then present their proposed valuations to the Valuation Committee and Board, and the Board makes a fair valuation determination for each portfolio investment that is to be fair valued. 
 Debt Investments 
 The debt investments identified on the consolidated schedules of investments are loans made to venture growth stage companies focused in technology and other high growth industries which are backed by a select group of leading venture capital investors. These investments are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 as there is no known or accessible market or market indices for these types of debt instruments and thus the Company must estimate the fair value of these investment securities based on models utilizing unobservable inputs. 
 To estimate the fair value of debt investments, the Company compares the cost basis of each debt investment, including any OID, to the resulting fair value determined using a discounted cash flow model, unless another model is more appropriate based on the circumstances at the measurement date. The discounted cash flow approach entails analyzing the interest rate spreads for recently completed financing transactions which are similar in nature to these debt investments, in order to determine a comparable range of effective market interest rates. The range of interest rate spreads utilized is based on borrowers with similar credit profiles. All remaining expected cash flows of the investment are discounted using this range of interest rates to determine a range of fair values for the debt investment. 
 The valuation process includes, among other things, evaluating the underlying investment performance of the portfolio company s current financial condition and ability to raise additional capital, as well as macro-economic events that may impact valuations. These events include, but are not limited to, current market yields and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. Changes in these unobservable inputs could result in significantly different fair value measurements.

 Credit Facility 
 In February 2014, the Company, along with its Financing Subsidiary as borrower, entered into a credit agreement with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch acting as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto, which provided the Company with a million commitment, subject to borrowing base requirements (as amended and restated from time to time, the Credit Facility ). On July 22, 2022, the Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, extend the revolving period from November 30, 2022 to May 31, 2024 and the scheduled maturity date from May 31, 2024 to November 30, 2025 (unless otherwise terminated earlier pursuant to its terms), as well as change the floating rate from LIBOR to SOFR. On April 29, 2024, the Company and the Financing Subsidiary amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the revolving period to August 31, 2024. On August 6, 2024, the Company and the Financing Subsidiary amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) further extend the revolving period from August 31, 2024 to November 30, 2025, (ii) extend the scheduled maturity date from November 30, 2025 to May 30, 2027, (iii) adjust the advance rates based on the underlying asset type, (iv) revise certain events of default provisions and affirmative and negative covenants; and (v) reduce the total commitments to million from million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million in total commitments available under the Credit Facility, which includes an accordion feature that allows the Company to increase the size of the Credit Facility to up to million under certain circumstances. 
 As of September 30, 2024 borrowings under the Credit Facility bore interest at the sum of (i) a floating rate based on certain indices, including SOFR and commercial paper rates (subject to a floor of ), plus (ii) a margin of if facility utilization is greater than or equal to , if utilization is greater than or equal to but less than , if utilization is less than and during the amortization period. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured only by the assets of the Financing Subsidiary. The Company agreed to pay Deutsche Bank AG a syndication fee and to pay to Deutsche Bank AG a fee to act as administrative agent under the Credit Facility as well as to pay each lender (i) a commitment fee based on each lender s commitment and (ii) a fee of per annum for any unused borrowings under the Credit Facility on a monthly basis. The Credit Facility contains affirmative and restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, an advance rate of up to of the applicable balance of net assets held by the Financing Subsidiary, maintenance of minimum net worth, a ratio of total assets to total indebtedness of not less than the greater of 3:2 and the amount so required under the 1940 Act, a key man clause relating to the Company s Chief Executive Officer, James P. Labe, and the Company s President and Chief Investment Officer, Sajal K. Srivastava, and eligibility requirements, including but not limited to geographic and industry concentration limitations and certain loan grade classifications. Furthermore, events of default under the Credit Facility include, among other things, (i) a payment default; (ii) a change of control; (iii) bankruptcy; (iv) a covenant default; and (v) failure by the Company to maintain its qualification as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.

million and million, respectively, excluding deferred credit facility costs of million and million, respectively, which is included in the Company s consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The book value of the Credit Facility approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity, cash repayments and market interest rates of the instrument. The fair value of the Credit Facility would be categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy if determined as of the reporting date. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of million and million, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate, inclusive of unused fees, of and , respectively 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of million and million, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate, inclusive of unused fees, of and , respectively.

 2025 Notes 
 On March 19, 2020, the Company completed a private debt offering of million in aggregate principal amount of its unsecured notes due March 19, 2025 (the 2025 Notes in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semiannually on March 19 and September 19 each year. 
 The 2025 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option at par plus accrued interest to the prepayment date and, if applicable, a make-whole premium.

 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include, without limitation, our ability to originate new loans and investments, borrowing costs and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved.

 Overview 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE under the symbol TPVG . 
 We were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC s investment platform. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespans. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology and other high growth industries.

 Portfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality 
 Portfolio Composition 
 We originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are generally used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) on a select basis, equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are typically used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrant investments as part of the transaction that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 309 investments in 107 companies. Our investments included 137 debt investments, 110 warrant investments, and 62 direct equity and related investments. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were 739.0 million and 721.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, six of our portfolio companies were publicly traded. As of September 30, 2024, the 137 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of 604.7 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 7.6 . Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.

 Asset Quality 
 Consistent with TPC s existing policies, our Adviser maintains a credit watch list which places borrowers into five risk categories based on our Adviser s senior investment team s judgment, where 1 is the best rating and all new loans are generally assigned a rating of 2. 
 Category Category Definition Action Item Clear (1) Performing above expectations and/or strong financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Review quarterly. White (2) Performing at expectations and/or reasonably close to it. Reasonable financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Generally, all new loans are initially graded White (2). Contact portfolio company periodically; in no event less than quarterly. Yellow (3) Performing generally below expectations and/or some proactive concern due to industry, business, financial and/or related factors. Adequate financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Contact portfolio company monthly or more frequently as determined by our Adviser s Investment Committee; contact venture capital investors. Orange (4) Needs close attention due to performance materially below expectations, weak financial and/or enterprise profile, concern regarding additional capital or exit equivalent. Contact portfolio company weekly or more frequently as determined by our Adviser s Investment Committee; contact venture capital investors regularly; our Adviser forms a workout group to minimize risk of loss. Red (5) Serious concern/trouble due to pending or actual default or equivalent. May experience partial and/or full loss. Maximize value from assets. 
 The following table shows the credit rankings for the portfolio companies that had outstanding debt obligations to us as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average investment ranking of our debt investment portfolio was 2.17 and 2.14, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, portfolio company credit category changes, excluding fundings and repayments, consisted of the following: one portfolio company with a principal balance of 20.0 million was upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1), one portfolio company with a principal balance of 5.9 million was upgraded from Yellow (3) to White (2), one portfolio company with a principal balance of 26.7 million was upgraded from Orange (4) to Yellow (3), and one portfolio company with a principal balance of 10.0 million was downgraded from Clear (1) to White (2). 
 57 

As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in three portfolio companies which were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate cost and fair value of 28.9 million and 17.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had investments in five portfolio companies which were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate cost and fair value of 41.7 million and 29.0 million, respectively. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 An important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 22.6 million, which was comprised of 13.8 million of net investment income and 8.8 million of net realized and unrealized gains. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 2.1 million, which was comprised of 19.1 million of net investment income and 17.0 million of net realized and unrealized losses. On a per share basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 0.35 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was 0.57 per share, as compared to net investment income of 0.54 per share and a net increase in net assets from operations of 0.06 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 39.2 million, which was comprised of 41.9 million of net investment income and 2.7 million of net realized and unrealized losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was 11.0 million, which was comprised of 56.5 million of net investment income and 67.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses. On a per share basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 1.08 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was 1.01 per share, as compared to net investment income of 1.59 per share and a net decrease in net assets from operations of 0.31 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Investment Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment and other income was 26.5 million as compared to 35.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in total investment and other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 period, is primarily due to a lower weighted average principal amount outstanding on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total investment and other income was 82.9 million as compared to 104.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in total investment and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 period, is primarily due to a lower weighted average principal amount outstanding on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 0.6 million in other income consisting of 0.1 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and 0.4 million from the realization of certain fees paid and accrued from portfolio companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 1.7 million in other income consisting of 0.7 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and 1.0 million from the realization of certain fees paid and accrued from portfolio companies. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 1.8 million in other income consisting of 0.4 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and 1.4 million from the realization of certain fees paid and accrued from portfolio companies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 3.7 million in other income consisting of 1.7 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and 2.0 million from the realization of certain fees paid and accrued from portfolio companies and other income related to prepayment activity. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Total operating expenses consist of our base management fee, income incentive fee, capital gains incentive fee, interest expense and amortization of fees, administration agreement expenses, and general and administrative expenses. We anticipate operating expenses would increase over time to the extent that our investment portfolio grows. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of total assets and net assets, would generally decrease over time to the extent that our portfolio and capital base expand. We expect that base management and income incentive fees would increase to the extent that we grow our asset base and our earnings. The capital gains incentive fee depends on realized gains and losses and unrealized losses. Interest expenses will generally increase as we borrow greater amounts under the Credit Facility, issue additional debt securities, and if interest rates increase. We generally expect expenses under the administration agreement and general and administrative expenses to increase over time to the extent that our investment portfolio grows, to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio. 
 58 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses were 12.7 million as compared to 16.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses were 41.0 million as compared to 48.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Base management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 3.4 million and 4.6 million, respectively. Base management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 11.6 million and 13.4 million, respectively. Base management fees decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to decreases in the average size of our portfolio during the applicable periods used in the calculations. 
 There were no income incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income incentive fee was reduced by 2.8 million and 8.4 million, respectively, due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase in net investment income of 2.8 million and 8.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 our income incentive fee was reduced by 3.8 million and 11.3 million, respectively, due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase in net investment income of 3.8 million and 11.3 million, respectively. 
 There were no capital gains incentive fee expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Interest expense and amortization of fees totaled 7.1 million and 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to a lower weighted-average outstanding principal balance under the Credit Facility. Interest expense and amortization of fees totaled 22.9 million and 28.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to a lower weighted-average outstanding principal balance under the Credit Facility. 
 Administration Agreement and general and administrative expenses totaled 2.2 million and 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which includes 0.4 million and 0.6 million of excise tax accruals, respectively. The decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to a reduction in legal fee expenses and excise tax accruals. Administration Agreement and general and administrative expenses totaled 6.6 million and 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which includes 1.1 million and 1.0 million of excise tax accruals, respectively. The increase for the 2024 periods, as compared to the 2023 periods, was primarily due to higher excise tax accruals and other professional fee expenses. 
 Net Realized Gains and Losses and Net Unrealized Gains and Losses 
 Realized gains and losses are included in net realized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net realized losses on investments of 5.0 million, resulting primarily from the acquisition of one portfolio company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net realized losses on investments of 32.7 million, consisting primarily of 33.6 million of net realized losses on debt investments from the write-off and restructures of investments, partially offset by 0.9 million of net warrant and equity gains from the sale and dispositions of investments. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized net realized losses on investments of 25.6 million, resulting primarily from the write-off of a debt investment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized net realized losses on investments of 23.7 million. 
 Unrealized gains and losses are included in net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Net change in unrealized gains during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.9 million, consisting of 9.4 million of net unrealized gains on the existing warrant and equity portfolio resulting from fair value adjustments and 5.2 million of net unrealized gains from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized losses from investments realized during the period, offset by 0.7 million of net unrealized losses on the debt investment portfolio resulting from fair value adjustments. Net change in unrealized gains during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.0 million, consisting of 27.5 million of net unrealized gains on the warrant and equity portfolio resulting from fair value adjustments and 12.7 million of net unrealized gains from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized losses from investments realized during the period, offset by 10.1 of net unrealized losses on the debt investment portfolio resulting from fair value adjustments. 
 Net change in unrealized gains during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 8.6 million, consisting of 17.6 million of net unrealized gains from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized losses from investments realized during the period, offset by 6.2 million of net unrealized losses on the existing debt investment portfolio and 2.8 million of net unrealized losses on the warrant and equity portfolio resulting from fair value adjustments. Net change in unrealized losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 43.8 million, consisting of 33.0 million of net unrealized losses on the debt investment portfolio and 10.8 million of net unrealized losses on the warrant and equity portfolio resulting from fair value adjustments. 
 Net change in realized and unrealized gains or losses in subsequent periods may be volatile as such results depend on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and other market factors.

Portfolio Yield and Total Return 
 Investment income includes interest income on our debt investments utilizing the effective yield method including cash interest income as well as the amortization of any purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the end-of-term EOT payments. 
 The following table shows the weighted average annualized portfolio yield on our debt investments, comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrant investments received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments:

 (1) Weighted average portfolio yields on debt investments for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period. The calculation of weighted average portfolio yields on debt investments excludes any non-income producing debt investments, but includes debt investments on non-accrual status. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. 
 (2) The weighted average portfolio yields on debt investments reflected above do not represent actual investment returns to our stockholders. 
 Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments may be higher than an investor s yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us and, thus, by our stockholders. In addition, our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Total return based on NAV is the change in ending NAV per share plus distributions per share paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning NAV per share for such period. Total return based on stock price is the change in the ending stock price of our common stock plus distributions paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning stock price of our common stock for such period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our total return during the periods based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 7.6 and 0.7 , respectively, and our total return during the periods based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was (8.1) and (7.6) , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our total return during the period based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 13.5 and (2.7) , respectively, and our total return during the period based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was (25.3) and 11.8 , respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates, including with respect to the valuation of our investments, could cause actual results to differ. 
 Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management s judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. We have identified the valuation of our investment portfolio, including our investment valuation policy (which has been approved by the Board), as our critical accounting policy and estimates. The critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Investment Valuation 
 Investment transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis. Our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 946 and measured in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the FASB. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market s participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity-specific measure. When market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that the Adviser believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instruments on the measurement date. 
 The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a variety of factors. To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Our valuation methodology is approved by the Board, and the Board is responsible for the fair values determined. As markets change, new types of investments are made, or pricing for certain investments becomes more or less observable, management, with oversight from the Board, may refine our valuation methodologies to best reflect the fair value of our investments appropriately. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with our Board-approved valuation policy, represented 92.6 of our total assets, as compared to 81.9 of our total assets as of December 31, 2023. 
 See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024 and Note 4. Investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our valuation process. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, as may be extended or renewed from time to time, and our anticipated cash flows from operations, including from net cash proceeds from our Current ATM Program (described below), as may be extended or renewed from time to time, and contractual monthly portfolio company payments and cash flows, prepayments, and the ability to liquidate publicly traded investments, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations, including to fund our unfunded commitment obligations. 
 From time to time, including at or near the end of each fiscal quarter, we consider using various temporary investment strategies for our business. One strategy includes taking proactive steps by utilizing cash equivalents as temporary assets with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility pursuant to Section 55 of the 1940 Act. More specifically, from time to time we may purchase U.S. Treasury bills or other high-quality, short-term debt securities at or near the end of the quarter and typically close out the position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. We may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions, including drawing down on the Credit Facility, as deemed appropriate. 
 Cash Flows 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations, was 106.3 million, and net cash used in financing activities was 229.3 million due primarily to net repayments under the Credit Facility of 205.0 million and 40.7 million in distributions paid, partially offset by 19.4 million from the issuance of common stock under the Current ATM Program and the Prior ATM Program. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was 48.6 million. 
 61 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations, was 63.0 million, and net cash provided by financing activities was 0.2 million due primarily to net borrowings under the Credit Facility of 35.0 million and 6.2 million from the issuance of common stock under the Prior ATM Program, partially offset by 40.8 million in distributions paid. As of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was 122.5 million. 
 Capital Resources and Borrowings 
 As a BDC, we generally have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. As a result, we expect, from time to time, to access the debt and equity markets when we believe it is necessary and appropriate to do so. In this regard, we continue to explore various options for obtaining additional debt or equity capital for investments. This may include expanding or extending the Credit Facility or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, including through our Current ATM Program, as may be extended or renewed, or debt securities. If we are unable to obtain leverage or raise equity capital on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to grow our portfolio could be substantially impacted. 
 million in total commitments available under the Credit Facility, subject to various covenants and borrowing base requirements. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature, which allows us to increase the size of the Credit Facility to up to 400.0 million under certain circumstances. The revolving period under the Credit Facility is scheduled to expire on November 30, 2025, and the scheduled maturity date of the Credit Facility is May 30, 2027 (unless otherwise terminated earlier pursuant to its terms). Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the sum of (i) a floating rate based on certain indices, including SOFR and commercial paper rates (subject to a floor of 0.50 ), plus (ii) a margin of 3.20 if facility utilization is greater than or equal to 75 , 3.35 if utilization is greater than or equal to 50 but less than 75 , 3.50 if utilization is less than 50 and 4.5 during the amortization period. See Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of 10.0 million and 215.0 million, respectively, excluding deferred credit facility costs of 4.6 million and 2.7 million, respectively, which is included in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. We had 290.0 million and 135.0 million of remaining capacity on our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and received net proceeds of 69.1 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs.

The maturity date of the 2025 Notes is scheduled for March 19, 2025. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2025 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of 69.9 million and 69.7 million, respectively. See Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2025 Notes.

The maturity date of the 2027 Notes is scheduled for February 28, 2027. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2027 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of 124.3 million and 124.1 million, respectively.

ATM Programs 
 On May 2, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Sales Agreement with the Adviser, the Administrator and the Sales Agent, providing for the issuance from time to time in the Current ATM Program of up to an aggregate of 75.0 million in shares of our common stock. Subject to the terms of the 2024 Sales Agreement, the Sales Agent is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of securities but will act as our sales agent using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the Sales Agent s normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between us and the Sales Agent. Concurrently upon entry into the 2024 Sales Agreement, we, the Adviser, the Administrator and the Sales Agent agreed to the termination of the 2022 Sales Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 56.5 million in shares remained available for sale under the Current ATM Program. 
 Asset Coverage Requirements 
 On June 21, 2018, our stockholders voted at a special meeting of stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize us to be subject to a reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150 under the 1940 Act. As a result of the stockholder approval at the special meeting, effective June 22, 2018, our applicable minimum asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act has been decreased to 150 from 200 . Thus, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 190 . 
 Contractual Obligations

Unfunded Commitments 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our unfunded commitments totaled 74.0 million and 118.1 million, respectively, of which 5.0 million and 29.2 million, respectively, was dependent upon the portfolio companies reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available to them. 
 The following table shows our unfunded commitments by portfolio company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 (1) Does not include backlog of potential future commitments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our unfunded commitments to nine companies totaled 74.0 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 5.4 million and 61.9 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our unfunded commitments to 14 companies totaled 118.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 112.2 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated. 
 Our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions that allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying portfolio company experiences material adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the portfolio company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. We generally expect 50 - 75 of our unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods. 
 64 

The fair value at the inception of the delay draw credit agreements with our portfolio companies is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the relevant counterparty s credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value for these unfunded commitments totaled 0.7 million and 1.6 million, respectively, and was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 
 Distributions 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90 of our net ordinary income and net realized short-term capital gains in excess of our net realized long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid a non-deductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, we would need to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (a) 98 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for such calendar year; (b) 98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and (c) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. For the tax years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we were subject to a 4 U.S. federal excise tax and we may be subject to this tax in future years. In such cases, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for the year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. Our Adviser monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a return of capital may occur for the year. We estimate the source of our distributions as required by Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act to determine whether payment of dividends are expected to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for the current period or certain cumulative periods, but we will not be able to determine whether any specific distribution will be treated as made out of our taxable earnings or as a return of capital until after the end of our taxable year. Any amount treated as a return of capital will reduce a stockholder s adjusted tax basis in his or her common stock, thereby increasing his or her potential gain or reducing his or her potential loss on the subsequent sale or other disposition of his or her common stock. On a quarterly basis, for any payment of dividends estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for the current period or certain cumulative periods based on the Section 19(a) requirement, we post a Section 19(a) notice through the Depository Trust Company s Legal Notice System and our website, as well as send our registered stockholders a printed copy of such notice along with the dividend payment. The estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on GAAP that are subject to revision, and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year. Therefore, these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes. 
 The following table shows our cash distributions per share that have been authorized by our Board since our initial public offering to September 30, 2024. From March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2015, and during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, 2018 and 2017 distributions represent ordinary income as our earnings exceeded distributions. Approximately 0.24 per share of the distributions during the year ended December 31, 2016 represented a return of capital. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, distributions represent ordinary income and long term capital gains. Any future distributions to our stockholders may be for amounts less than our historical distributions, may be made less frequently than historical practices, and may be made in part cash and part stock (as per each stockholder s election), subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20 of the aggregate declared distribution.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). This change is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, allowing financial statement users to better understand the components of a segment's profit or loss and assess potential future cash flows for each reportable segment and the entity as a whole. The amendments expand a public entity's segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM ), clarifying when an entity may report one or more additional measures to assess segment performance, requiring enhanced interim disclosures and providing new disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, among other new disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance with respect to the consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Income Incentive Fee Waiver 
 Commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2025, until and including the quarter ending December 31, 2025, the Adviser has agreed to waive the portion of the income incentive fee payable for a quarter under the Advisory Agreement if and to the extent that, after payment of such income incentive fee, our net investment income per share for such quarter is below the quarterly distribution per share for such quarter. 
 Distribution 
 On October 30, 2024, the Board declared a 0.30 per share regular quarterly distribution payable on December 27, 2024 to stockholders of record on December 13, 2024. 
 Recent Portfolio Activity 
 From October 1, 2024 through November 5, 2024, TPC s direct originations platform entered into 70.0 million of additional non-binding signed term sheets with venture growth stage companies. These investment opportunities for us are subject to due diligence, definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with the Adviser s allocation policy. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. We are also subject to risks relating to the capital markets; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; conditions affecting the general economy; legislative reform; and local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability. U.S. and global capital markets and credit markets have recently been experiencing an increase in the level of volatility across such markets and in the values of publicly-traded securities. Any continuation of the stresses on capital markets and credit markets, or a further increase in volatility, could result in a contraction of available credit for us and/or an inability by us to access the equity or debt capital markets, or could otherwise cause an inability or unwillingness of our lenders to fund their commitments to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings and in the relative values of our portfolio that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates or reference rates to the extent that any debt investments include floating interest rates. Debt investments are made with either floating rates that are subject to contractual minimum interest rates for the term of the investment or fixed interest rates. 
 A prolonged reduction in interest rates could reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in interest rates are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over the Prime Rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities. 
 67 

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 60.0 , or 364.1 million in principal balance, of the debt investments in our portfolio bore interest at floating rates, which generally are Prime-based, and all of which have interest rate floors of 3.25 or higher. Substantially all of our unfunded commitments float with changes in the Prime Rate from the date we enter into the commitment to the date of the actual draw. In addition, our interest expense will be affected by changes in the interest rate in connection with our Credit Facility to the extent it remains above the interest rate floor; however, our 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate (subject to a 1.00 increase in the fixed rate in the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement (as modified by the First Supplement with respect to the 2026 Notes and the Second Supplement with respect to the 2027 Notes)) occurs). 
 As of September 30, 2024, our floating rate borrowings totaled 10.0 million, which represented 2.5 of our outstanding debt. As of September 30, 2024, all of our floating rate debt investments were subject to interest-rate floors set at 3.25 or higher. Because the Prime Rate as of September 30, 2024 was 8.00 , which is at or above the interest-rate floors applicable to our floating rate debt investments, decreases in interest rates will impact our interest income to a limited extent until the Prime Rate reaches 3.25 , while increases in interest rates will increase our interest income to the extent that such rates exceed the applicable interest-rate floor. In addition, with respect to interest expense on our floating rate borrowings under the Credit Facility, we will benefit from any decreases in interest rates up to the point that the SOFR rate decreases to 0.50 , which is the SOFR interest-rate floor under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. However, because current interest rates exceed the SOFR interest-rate floor under our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, our interest expense on floating rate borrowings will increase if rates rise. The following table illustrates the annual impact on our net investment income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure from the September 30, 2024 consolidated statement of assets and liabilities: 
 Change in Interest Rates (in thousands) Increase (decrease) in interest income (Increase) decrease in interest expense Net increase (decrease) in net investment income Up 300 basis points 10,649 (300) 10,349 Up 200 basis points 7,055 (200) 6,855 Up 100 basis points 3,462 (100) 3,362 Up 50 basis points 1,665 (50) 1,615 Down 50 basis points (1,654) 50 (1,604) Down 100 basis points (3,209) 100 (3,109) Down 200 basis points (5,860) 200 (5,660) Down 300 basis points (7,796) 300 (7,496) 
 This analysis is indicative of the potential impact on our investment income as of September 30, 2024, assuming an immediate and sustained change in interest rates as noted. It should be noted that we anticipate growth in our portfolio funded in part with additional borrowings and such additional borrowings, all else being equal, will increase our investment income sensitivity to interest rates to the extent such borrowings have floating interest rates, and such changes could be material. In addition, this analysis does not adjust for potential changes in our portfolio or our borrowing facilities after September 30, 2024 nor does it take into account any changes in the credit performance of our loans that might occur should interest rates change. 
 Because it is our intention to hold loans to maturity, the fluctuating relative value of these loans that may occur due to changes in interest rates may have an impact on unrealized gains and losses during quarterly reporting periods. Based on our assessment of the interest rate risk, as of September 30, 2024, we had no hedging transactions in place as we deemed the risk acceptable, and we did not believe it was necessary to mitigate this risk at that time. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We may also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with certain investments. Such investments are translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at the relevant balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in the exchange rate. Based on our assessment of the foreign currency exchange rate risk, as of September 30, 2024, we had no hedging transactions in place as we deemed the risk acceptable, and we did not believe it was necessary to mitigate this risk at that time. 
 While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency forward contracts, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to our portfolio investments. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively hedge our interest rate risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors drive our performance more directly than does inflation. Changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not necessarily correlate with changes in inflation rates.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management has not identified any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1A. 
 
 The amount and frequency of any distributions we may make is uncertain. You may not receive distributions or our distributions may not grow over time. 
 We intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of equity investments in portfolio companies and fee and expense reimbursement or fee waivers from the Adviser, if any. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Any distributions made from sources other than cash flow from operations or relying on fee waivers or expense reimbursement, if any, from the Adviser are not based on our investment performance, and can be sustained only if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Adviser continues to waive such fees or make such expense reimbursements, if any. The extent to which we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations will depend on various factors, including the performance of our investments, the level of participation in our distribution reinvestment plan and how quickly we invest the proceeds from any offering. Stockholders should also understand that any future repayments to the Adviser, if applicable, will reduce the distributions that stockholders would otherwise receive. There can be no assurance that we will achieve such performance in order to sustain our distributions, or be able to pay distributions at all. Except with respect to its agreement to waive all or a portion of the quarterly income incentive fee under certain circumstances through the quarter ending December 31, 2025, the Adviser has no obligation to waive fees. 
 Our ability to pay distributions might be materially and adversely affected by the impact of one or more of the risks described in our SEC filings, including herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024). Due to the asset coverage test applicable to us under the 1940 Act as a BDC, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of RIC status and covenants under our borrowing arrangements, compliance with applicable BDC, SBA regulations (when and if applicable) and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that we will make distributions to our stockholders in the future.

 We did not sell any equity securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that were not registered under the Securities Act. Similarly, we did not repurchase any shares of our equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 96,312 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan. These issuances were not subject to the registration requirements under the Securities Act. The cash paid for shares of common stock issued under our dividend reinvestment plan during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.6 million. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities

Item 5. Other Information 
 Income Incentive Fee Waiver 
 Commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2025, until and including the quarter ending December 31, 2025, the Adviser has agreed to waive the portion of the income incentive fee payable for a quarter under the Advisory Agreement if and to the extent that, after payment of such income incentive fee, the Company s net investment income per share for such quarter is below the Company s quarterly distribution per share for such quarter. 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. 
 Fees and Expenses 
 The information in the following table is being provided to update, as of September 30, 2024, certain information in the Company s effective shelf registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-277680), declared effective by the SEC on April 18, 2024, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement relating to our Current ATM Program. The information is intended to assist you in understanding the costs and expenses that an investor in our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. We caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary. Except where the context suggests otherwise, whenever this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or any filing under the Securities Act into which this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated by reference, contains a reference to fees or expenses paid by you, us or the Company, or that we will pay fees or expenses, our stockholders will indirectly bear such fees or expenses as investors in us. 
 Except as noted below, the following annualized percentages were calculated based on actual expenses incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and net assets as of September 30, 2024, and do not include events occurring subsequent thereto. The table and examples below include all fees and expenses of our consolidated subsidiaries. 
 (1) 
 Offering expenses (as a percentage of offering price) (2) 
 Dividend reinvestment plan expenses (3) 
 Total Stockholder Transaction Expenses (as a percentage of offering price) Annual Expenses (as a percentage of net assets attributable to common stock): Base management fee payable under the Advisory Agreement (4) 
 Incentive fee payable under the Advisory Agreement (20 of net investment income and realized capital gains) (5) 
 Interest payments on borrowed funds (6) 
 Other expenses (7) 
 Total annual expenses 
 __________ 
 (1) The amounts set forth in this table do not reflect the impact of any sales load, sales commission or other offering expenses borne by us and our stockholders. The maximum agent commission with respect to the shares of our common stock sold by us in the Current ATM Program is 2.0 of gross proceeds, with the exact amount of such compensation to be mutually agreed upon by us and the Sales Agent from time to time. In the event that securities are sold to or through underwriters or agents, a corresponding prospectus or prospectus supplement will disclose the applicable sales load or commission.

Example 
 You would pay the following expenses on a 1,000 investment, assuming a 5 annual return entirely from realized capital gains 160 430 643 1,002 
 __________________ 
 (1) Assumes no return from net realized capital gains or net unrealized capital appreciation. 
 While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5 annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5 . As noted, the example includes the realized capital gains fee from the Advisory Agreement but does not include the income incentive fee under the Advisory Agreement, which, assuming a 5 annual return, would either not be payable or have an immaterial impact on the expense amounts shown above. If we achieve sufficient returns on our investments to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our expenses, and returns to our investors, would be higher. 
 Further, while the example assumes reinvestment of all distributions at NAV, participants in our dividend reinvestment plan will receive a number of shares of our common stock determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to a participant by (a) 95 of the market price per share of our common stock at the close of trading on the payment date fixed by the Board in the event that newly issued shares of our common stock are used to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, or (b) the average purchase price of all shares of common stock purchased by the plan administrator in the event that shares are purchased in the open market to implement the requirements of the dividend reinvestment plan, which may be at, above or below NAV. 
 This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual expenses (including the cost of debt, if any, and other expenses) may be greater or less than those shown.

 On November 5, 2024, the reported closing sales price of our common stock was per share. As of November 5, 2024, we had 7 stockholders of record, which did not include stockholders for whom shares are held in nominee or street name . 
 Shares of BDCs may trade at a market price that is less than the value of the net assets attributable to those shares. The possibility that shares of our common stock will trade at a discount from NAV or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term are separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether the shares offered hereby will trade at, above or below NAV.
