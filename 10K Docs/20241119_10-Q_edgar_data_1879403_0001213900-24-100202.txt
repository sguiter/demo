As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
there was no unrecognized expense related to warrants. 

The valuation methodology used to determine the
fair value of the warrants was the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of a number of assumptions
including volatility of the stock price, the average risk-free interest rate, and the weighted average expected life of the warrant. 

Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount
by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award. The Company s
estimated volatility is an average of the historical volatility of peer entities over the shorter of i) the period equal to the expected
life of the award or ii) the period over which the peer company was publicly traded. The Company uses the historical volatility of peer
entities due to the lack of sufficient historical data of its stock price. 

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based
upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of the award at the
grant date.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS . 

The following discussion and analysis are
intended to help investors understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources. You
should read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As discussed in the section titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions
that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), which include information relating to future events, future financial performance, financial projections, strategies, expectations,
competitive environment and regulation. Words such as may, should, could, would, 
 predicts, potential, continue, expects, anticipates, future, 
 intends, plans, believes, estimates and similar expressions, as well as statements
in the future tense, identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance
or results and may not be accurate indications of when such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based
on information we have when those statements are made or management s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future
events and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from
those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are
not limited to: 

our expectations regarding
 consumer trends in residential real estate transactions; 

our expectations regarding
 overall economic and demographic trends, including the continued growth of the U.S. residential real estate market; 

our ability to grow our
 business organically in the various local markets that we serve; 

our ability to attract
 and retain additional qualified agents and other personnel; 

our ability to expand our
 franchises in both new and existing markets; 

our ability to increase
 the number of closed transactions sides and sides per agent; 

our ability to cross-sell
 our services among our subsidiaries; 

our ability to maintain
 compliance with the law and regulations of federal, state, foreign, county and local governmental authorities, or private associations
 and governing boards; 

our ability to expand,
 maintain and improve the information technologies and systems that we rely upon to operate; 

our ability to prevent
 security breaches, cybersecurity incidents and interruptions, delays and failures of our technology infrastructure; 

our ability to retain our
 founder and current executive officers and other key employees; 

our ability to identify
 quality potential acquisition candidates in order to accelerate our growth; 

23 

our ability to manage our
 future growth and dependence on our agents; 

our ability to maintain
 the strength of our brands; 

our ability to maintain
 and increase our financial performance; 

the market price for our
 common stock may be particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly traded public
 float, and minimal profits, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price; 

there have recently been
 recent instances of extreme stock price run-ups followed by rapid price declines and stock price volatility seemingly unrelated to
 company performance following a number of recent initial public offerings, particularly among companies, like ours, that have had
 relatively smaller public floats; 

sales of our common stock
 by us or our stockholders, which may result in increased volatility in our stock price; and 

other factors, including
 the risks contained in the section entitled Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
 December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission SEC or Commission on April 16,
 2024, relating to our industry, our operations, and results of operations. 

The foregoing does not represent an exhaustive
list of matters that may be covered by the forward-looking statements contained herein or risk factors that we are faced with that may
cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements. 

Moreover, new risks regularly emerge, and it
is not possible for our management to predict or articulate all risks we face, nor can we assess the impact of all risks on our business
or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. All forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on information available to us on
the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except to the extent required by applicable laws or rules, we undertake no obligation
to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent
written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety
by the cautionary statements contained above and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Business Overview 

We are a holding company for five agent-centric,
technology-integrated, cloud-based, multi-service real estate segments. Our primary business, La Rosa Realty, LLC, has been listed in
the Top 75 Residential Real Estate Firms in the United States from 2016 through 2020 by the National Association of Realtors,
the leading real estate industry trade association in the United States. 

In addition to providing person-to-person residential and commercial
real estate brokerage services to the public, we cross sell ancillary technology-based products and services primarily to our sales agents
and the sales agents associated with our franchisees. Our business is organized based on the services we provide internally to our agents
and to the public, which are residential and commercial real estate brokerage, franchising, real estate brokerage education and coaching,
and property management. Our real estate brokerage business operates primarily under the trade name La Rosa Realty, which we own, and,
to a lesser extent, under the trade name Better Homes Realty which we license. We have 24 La Rosa Realty corporate real estate brokerage
offices and branches located in Florida, California, Texas, Georgia, and Puerto Rico. We have 8 La Rosa Realty franchised real estate
brokerage offices and branches and 3 affiliated real estate brokerage offices that pay us fees in three states in the United States and
Puerto Rico. Our real estate brokerage offices, both corporate and franchised, are staffed with 2,647 licensed real estate brokers and
sales associates as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9 since December 31, 2023. In addition to our real estate brokerage offices,
we also have a wholly owned title services company that was acquired during the quarter. 

We have built our business by providing the home
buying public with well trained, knowledgeable realtors who have access to our proprietary and third-party in-house technology tools
and quality education and training, and valuable marketing that attracts some of the best local realtors who provide value-added services
to our home buyers and sellers that are attracted to our brands. We give our real estate brokers and sales agents who are seeking financial
independence a turnkey solution and support them in growing their brokerages while they fund their own businesses. This enables us to
maintain a low fixed-cost business with several recurring revenue streams, yielding relatively high margins and cash flow. 

Our agent-centric commission model enables our
sales agents to obtain higher net commissions than they would otherwise receive from many of our competitors in our local markets. We
believe that agents who join our Company from the major real estate brokerage firms have increased their income by an average of approximately
forty percent (40 ). They can then use this additional income to reinvest in their businesses or as take-home profit. This is a strong
incentive for them to compete against the discount, flat fee and internet brokerages that have sprung up in the past several years. Instead
of us taking a greater share of their income, our agents pay what we believe to be reduced rates for training and mentorship and our
proprietary technology. Our franchise model has a similar pricing methodology, permitting the franchise owner the freedom to operate
their business with minimal control and lower expense than other franchise offerings. 

Moreover, we believe that our proprietary technology,
training, and the support that we provide to our agents at a minimal cost to them is one of the best offered in the industry. 

24 

In March 2024, the Company officially launched
Final Offer. Final Offer is available to real estate brokers on the Company s platform in key markets across Florida, California
and Georgia, with plans to expand the offering across the organization. 

In February 2023, we launched our proprietary
technology system - JAEME, part of My Agent Account. JAIME is a real estate AI assistant created to support and inspire
our agents with personalized content to drive marketing, efficiency, and sales. This advanced technology can help agents to provide services
to their clients in a more efficient way - even from their mobile devices. In October 2024, the Company launched My Agent Account version
3.0, a significant upgrade to its proprietary platform, which now includes a new module specifically designed for property management
disbursements. This update is expected to improve operational efficiency for agents across the Company. 

In June 2024, the Company recruited a high-performing
group of team leaders in Florida, who closed over 425 transactions and achieved sales exceeding 100 million in the past 12 months. 

In the first nine months of 2024, we acquired
majority ownership of the following franchisees of the Company: La Rosa Realty Georgia, LLC, La Rosa Realty California, La Rosa Realty
Lakeland LLC, La Rosa Realty Success LLC and 100 ownership of La Rosa Realty Winter Garden LLC, BF Prime LLC, and Nona Title Agency LLC.
In November 2024, we acquired 49 membership interests of our subsidiary, La Rosa Realty Premier, LLC, which became our wholly owned subsidiary. 

We intend to continue growing our business organically and by acquisition. 

It is management s intention to acquire
additional franchisees and other entities through the remainder of 2024 and in 2025. We continuously look to search for potential acquisition
targets. Management is in discussions with several franchisees; however, any future agreements may have terms that are materially different
than the terms of completed acquisitions. We cannot guarantee that the Company will actually enter into any binding acquisition agreements
with any of those companies. If we do, we cannot assure you that the terms of such acquisitions will be substantially the same or better
for the Company than those of completed acquisitions. 

Description of Our Revenues 

Our financial results are primarily driven by
the total number of sales agents in our Company, the number of sales agents closing residential real estate transactions, the number
of sales agents utilizing our coaching services, the number of agents who work with our franchisees, and the number of properties under
management. We increased our agent count by just over 6 , from 2,493 at September 30, 2023 to 2,647 at September 30, 2024. 

The majority of our revenue is derived from a
stable set of fees paid by our brokers, franchisees, and consumers. We have multiple revenue streams, with the majority of our revenue
derived from commissions paid by consumers who transact business with our and our franchisees agents, royalties paid by our franchisees,
dues and technology fees paid by our sales agents, our franchisees, and our franchisees agents. Our major revenue streams come
from such sources as: (i) residential real estate brokerage revenue, (ii) revenue from our property management services, (iii) franchise
royalty fees, (iv) fees from the sale or renewal of franchises and other franchise revenue, (v) coaching, training and assistance fees,
(vi) brokerage revenue generated transactionally on commercial real estate, (vii) fees from our events and forums, and (viii) revenue
from title services. 

The majority of our revenue is derived from fees
and dues based on the number of agents working under the La Rosa Realty brand. Due to the low fixed cost structure of both our Company
and franchise models, the addition of new sales agents generally requires little incremental investment in capital or infrastructure.
Accordingly, the number of commission producing sales agents in our Company and our franchisees is the most important factor affecting
our results of operations and the addition of new agents can favorably impact our revenue and our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization EBITDA ). Historically, the number of agents in the residential real estate industry has been highly correlated
with overall home sale transaction activity. We believe that the number of agents and those that produce commissions in our network is
the primary statistic that drives our revenue. Another major factor is the cyclicality of the real estate industry that has peaks and
valleys depending on macroeconomic conditions that we cannot control. And finally, our revenues fluctuate based on the changes in the
aggregate fee revenue per sales agent as a significant portion of our revenue is tied to various fees that are ultimately tied to the
number of agents, including annual dues, continuing franchise fees, and certain transaction or service-based fees. Our revenue per agent
also increases in other ways including when transaction sides and transaction sizes increase since a portion of our revenue comes from
fees tied to the number and size of real estate transactions closed by our agents.

Key factors affecting our performance 

As a result of a number of factors, our historical
results of operations may not be comparable to our results of operations in future periods, and our results of operations may not be
directly comparable from period to period. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting our results of operations. 

Seasonality 

Our business is affected by the seasons and weather.
The spring and summer seasons, when school is out, have typically resulted in higher sales volumes compared to fall and winter seasons.
With the slowdown in the later months, we have experienced slower listing activity, fewer transaction closings and lower revenues and
have seen more agent turnover as well. Bad weather or natural disasters also negatively impact listings and sales which reduces our operating
income, net income, operating margins and cash flow. While this pattern is fairly predictable, there can be no assurance that it will
continue. Moreover, with the impact of climate change, we expect more business disruptions in the coming years, many of which could be
unpredictable and extreme. 

Our revenues and operating margins will fluctuate
in successive quarters due to a wide variety of factors, including seasonality, weather, health exigencies, holidays, national or international
emergencies, the school year calendar s impact on timing of family relocations, and changes in mortgage interest rates. This fluctuation
may make it difficult to compare or analyze our financial performance effectively across successive quarters. 

Inflation and Market Interest Rates 

The U.S. Federal Reserve continues to take action
intended to address the increases in inflation. The Federal Reserve Board maintained the federal funds rate at 533 basis points from
August of 2023 through mid-September 2024, when it was then reduced to 483 basis points. The fluctuations impact interest rates, which
significantly contribute to mortgage rate adjustments. During the second half of 2022, the benchmark 30 year fixed conforming
mortgage rate rose above 6 for the first time since 2008, according to Freddie Mac data, and reached a peak of about 8 during the second
half of 2023. That interest rate sat in between 6.1 and 6.9 during Q3 of 2024. Consequently, housing demand has softened, prices are
rising, consumer sentiment has weakened, and home sales are declining. In September of 2024, the existing home sales market declined
3.5 compared to September of 2023 according to the National Association of Realtors. This decline had an adverse impact on consumer
demand for our services, as consumers weighed the financial implications of selling or purchasing a home. Continuing poor housing market
conditions would adversely affect our operating performance and results of operations. 

Recent Legal Challenges to Sales Agents 
Commission Structure 

Recent developments in the real estate industry
have seen increased scrutiny and legal challenges related to the structure of real estate agent commissions. Legal actions and regulatory
inquiries have been initiated to examine the fairness, transparency, and potential anticompetitive practices associated with the traditional
commission model. Courts and regulatory bodies may be increasingly focused on ensuring transparency in commission structures, potentially
leading to reforms that impact the earnings and business models of real estate professionals. Changes in legislation or legal precedents
could impact the standard practices of commission-sharing between listing agents and buyer s agents and may adversely affect our
business model and revenues. On October 31, 2023, a federal jury in Missouri found that NAR and certain companies conspired to artificially
inflate brokerage commissions, which violates federal antitrust law. The judgment was appealed on October 31, 2023, while these and other
plaintiffs have filed similar lawsuits against a number of other large real estate brokerage companies. We have not, as of the date hereof,
been named as a defendant in any antitrust litigation. On or about March 15, 2024, NAR agreed to settle these lawsuits, by agreeing to
pay 418 million over approximately four years, and changing certain of its rules surrounding agent commissions. This settlement resolves
claims against NAR and nearly every NAR member; all state, territorial and local REALTOR associations; all association-owned MLSs;
and all brokerages with an NAR member as principal whose residential transaction volume in 2022 was 2 billion or below and is subject
to court approval. Due to this litigation, there will be rule changes for the NAR. In the settlement, effective mid-July 2024, NAR has
agreed to put in place a new rule prohibiting offers of compensation on the MLS, as well as adopt new rules requiring written agreements
between buyers and buyers agents. However, the direct and indirect effects, if any, of the judgment upon the real estate industry
are not yet entirely clear. 

There could also be further changes in real estate
industry practices. All of this has prompted discussion of changes to rules established by local or state real estate boards or multiple
listing services. All of this may require changes to many brokers business models, including changes in agent and broker compensation.
For example, we will likely have to develop mechanisms and a plan that enable buyers and sellers to negotiate commissions. The Company
will continue to monitor ongoing and similar antitrust litigation against our competitors. However, the litigation and its ramifications
could cause unforeseen turmoil in our industry, the impacts of which could have a negative effect on us as an industry participant.

Cybersecurity 

Our business faces cybersecurity risks that could
have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, and reputation. Key factors contributing to cybersecurity
risks include, but are not limited to: 

Constantly Evolving
 Threat Landscape : The landscape of cybersecurity threats is constantly evolving, with new attack vectors, malware, and vulnerabilities
 emerging regularly. We may not be able to anticipate or mitigate all potential threats effectively. 

Data Vulnerability :
 We collect, store, and process sensitive customer and corporate data, making us a target for cybercriminals seeking to steal or exploit
 this information. A data breach could lead to financial and legal liabilities, including regulatory fines and customer trust erosion. 

Third-Party Risks :
 Our reliance on third-party service providers exposes us to risks associated with their cybersecurity practices. A breach or security
 failure in a third-party system could impact our operations and data. 

Phishing and Social
 Engineering : Employees and individuals connected to our organization may be susceptible to phishing attacks or social engineering
 tactics that compromise security. Human error or manipulation can lead to breaches. 

Regulatory Compliance :
 We are subject to various data protection and privacy regulations, and non-compliance could result in legal and financial penalties.
 Adhering to these regulations requires ongoing efforts and resources. 

Business Interruption :
 A cyberattack or system breach may disrupt our operations, affecting our ability to serve customers, fulfill orders, and maintain
 revenue, resulting in financial losses. 

Reputation Damage :
 A publicized cybersecurity incident can significantly damage our brand and reputation, leading to customer churn and reduced market
 confidence. 

Additionally, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted
new cybersecurity disclosure rules for public companies that require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management (including the
corporate board s role in overseeing cybersecurity risks, management s role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity
risks, and processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks) in annual reports. These new cybersecurity disclosure
rules also require the disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents in a Form 8-K, generally within four days of determining an incident
is material. We have included respective disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed
with the Commission on April 16, 2024. Since June 15, 2024, we are subject to such Form 8-K disclosure requirements. 

We may at times fail (or be perceived to have
failed) in our efforts to comply with our privacy and data security obligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third
parties on whom we rely on may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. 

Any failure or perceived failure by us or third
parties upon whom we rely to comply with obligations, relating to privacy and data security may result in significant consequences including
but not limited to governmental investigations and enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections,
and similar), litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, and orders to destroy
or not use personal information. 

Any of these events could have a material adverse
effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to loss of customers; interruptions or stoppages
in our business operations; inability to process personal information; limited ability to develop or commercialize our products; expenditure
of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or substantial changes to our business model or operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial
condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts
reported. Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the condensed consolidated
financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 describe the significant accounting policies and methods
used in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the
Company s critical accounting estimates since the Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2023.

Three Months Ending September 30 

Franchising services revenue decreased by approximately 152 thousand,
or 70 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributable
from the six acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the seven acquisitions completed in the first nine months
of fiscal year 2024, which no longer contribute to franchising royalties fees, which would have totaled approximately 163 thousand in
the third quarter of 2024. Our remaining franchisees saw a similar decrease in volume related to the same market conditions in our residential
services, which negatively impacted our franchising royalty fee revenue. 

Costs of revenue for franchising services increased
by approximately 4 thousand, or 3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023, related to the increase costs of the external software that supports the Company s franchises. The gross profit (loss) of
franchising services has moved to a loss position for the three-month period ending September 30, 2024 over the comparable prior year
period, which is attributable to the reduction in the cost of revenue due to the acquisitions of the thirteen franchises in the fourth
quarter of 2023 and the first three quarters of 2024.

of fiscal year 2024, which no longer contribute to franchising royalties fees, which would have totaled approximately 505 thousand in
the third quarter of 2024. Our remaining franchisees saw a similar decrease in volume related to the same market conditions in our residential
services, which negatively impacted our franchising royalty fee revenue.

Selling, general and administrative costs, excluding stock-based compensation,
increased by approximately 2.0 million, or 203 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. A portion of the increase was driven by 1.1 million of additional costs from the six acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter
of fiscal year 2023 and the seven acquisitions completed in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2024. The remaining increase is primarily
attributable to approximately 441 thousand in public company costs, including listing costs, printer costs, transfer agent fees, and
investor relation costs and related professional fees, since our initial public offering in October 2023 as well as approximately 286
thousand of amortization of the intangible assets incurred through the acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first three
quarters of 2024 and an increase in personnel costs of 680 thousand.

Selling, general and administrative costs, excluding stock-based compensation,
increased by approximately 5.6 million, or 192 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. A portion of the increase was driven by 2.4 million of additional costs from the six acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter
of fiscal year 2023 and the seven acquisitions completed in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2024. The remaining increase is primarily
attributable to approximately 1.9 million in public company costs, including listing costs, printer costs, transfer agent fees, D O
insurance and investor relation costs and related professional fees as well as approximately 726 thousand of amortization of the intangible
assets incurred through the acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first three quarters of 2024, an increase in personnel
costs of 1.6 million, and additional events and technology costs of 341 thousand. 

Stock-based compensation 

We incurred stock-based compensation of approximately
 390 thousand and 4.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to option grants to
our CEO pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement 2.1 million), other employees 1.0 million), and investors and consultants
who provided various services to the company 1.0 million). We incurred stock-based compensation of approximately 5 thousand and 79
thousand in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to option grants given to the non-management
directors of our board of directors in February 2022. 

33 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was
approximately 645 thousand compared to other income, net, of approximately 74 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The expense in 2024 was due to interest expense and the amortization of financing fees related to the debt raise in February, April and
July 2024, the loss on extinguishment related to the same three notes in September 2024 and the Advances on Future Receipts in May 2024,
partially offset by a 219 thousand decrease in the revaluation of the derivative liabilities associated with the convertible debt. The
income in 2023 was due to an IRS employee retention credit received for prior tax years, net of legal costs to obtain the credit, partially
offset by amortization of financing fees. 

Other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was
approximately 1.152 million compared to other expense, net, of approximately 612 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The expense in 2024 was due to interest expense and the amortization of financing fees related to the debt raise in February, April and
July 2024, the loss on extinguishment related to the same three notes in September 2024 and the Advances on Future Receipts in May 2024,
partially offset by an decrease in the value of the derivative liabilities associated with the convertible debt. The 2023 expense was
due to costs related to the amortization of financing fees related to convertible debt instruments with embedded equity elements issued
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 along with an increase in interest expense associated with new debt issuances during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2022, partially offset by a decrease in the revaluation of the derivative liabilities and the IRS employee retention
credit received for prior tax years, net of legal costs to obtain the credit. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
we had cash of approximately 1.8 million and 1.0 million, respectively, on hand. 

We are subject to the risks and challenges associated
with companies at a similar stage of development. These include dependence on key individuals, successful development and marketing of
its offerings, and competition with larger companies with greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than us. 

Since our inception in 2021, we have funded our
operations through our revenues and the sale of equity and debt securities. 

In October 2023, we raised gross proceeds of
 5,000,000 through our sale of 1,000,000 shares of common stock in the initial public offering for 5.00 per share, with net proceeds
of 4,360,000. 

In February 2024, we received 1,000,000 in
net proceeds, excluding debt issuance costs of 188 thousand, through our private sale of a 13 OID secured promissory note in the principal
amount of 1,052,632 for a purchase price of 1,000,000 to an accredited investor. 

In April 2024, we received 1,250,200 in net
proceeds, excluding debt issuance costs of 139 thousand, through our private sale of a 13 OID senior secured promissory note in the
principal amount of 1,316,000 for a purchase price of 1,250,200 to the same accredited investor in our February 2024 private placement. 

In May 2024, we entered into a standard merchant cash advance agreement
where we sold in the aggregate 761,250 in future receipts of the Company for 500,000. Until the purchase price has been repaid, the
Company agreed to pay Cedar 23,000 per week. 

In July 2024, we received 444,600 in net proceeds,
excluding debt issuance costs of approximately 25 thousand, through our private sale of a 13 OID senior secured promissory note in
the principal amount of 468,000 for a purchase price of 444,600 to the same accredited investor in our February 2024 and April 1 private
placements. 

In August 2024, we received 725,000 in net proceeds,
excluding equity issuance costs of approximately 25 thousand, by issuing 761,689 shares of common stock and a pre-funded warrant to
purchase 509,498 shares of common stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with an institutional accredited investor, Brown
Stone Capital Ltd., at a price equal to 0.59 per share. 

On September 26, 2024, we entered into a promissory note for the principal
amount of 200,000. The promissory note bears interest at 12.5 per annum. The note is payable in three monthly installments of 75,000,
beginning on November 1, 2024, with subsequent payments due on December 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025. 

Furthermore, during the period required to achieve
substantially higher revenue in order to become profitable, we will require additional funds that might not be readily available or might
not be on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Until such time that we fully implement our growth strategy, we expect to continue
to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future, mostly due to corporate overhead and costs of being a public company. As such,
we anticipate that our existing working capital, including cash on hand and cash generated from operations, will not be sufficient to
meet projected operating expenses for the foreseeable future through at least twelve months from the issuance of this quarterly report
on Form 10-Q. We will be required to raise additional capital to service the three promissory notes issued in the first half of 2024,
to repay the principal balance of each of the notes, and to fund ongoing operations. 

We have incurred recurring net losses, and our
operations have not provided net positive cash flows. In view of these matters, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. We plan on continuing to expand via acquisition, which will help achieve future profitability, and we have plans
to raise capital from outside investors, as we have done in the past, to fund operating losses and to provide capital for further business
acquisitions. We cannot provide any assurance that we can successfully raise the capital needed on favorable terms, if at all.

On November 24, 2023, the Company received written
notification from the staff (the Staff of Nasdaq indicating that the Company no longer meets Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2)
requiring the Company to maintain a minimum market value of listed securities MVLS of 35 million. The notice was based
on a review of the Company s MVLS for the past 30 consecutive business days. Nasdaq s listing rules provided the Company
with a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until May 22, 2024, in which to regain compliance. On April 18, 2024, the Company received
a written notification from the Staff informing the Company that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq Continue Listing Rules by satisfying
Nasdaq s Equity Standard under Listing Rule 5550(b) based on the Company s stockholders equity reported on the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2023 and the matter is now closed. 

On October 10, 2024, the Company received a letter
from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was no longer in compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing
on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Rule ). Nasdaq has granted the Company 180 calendar days, or
until April 8, 2025, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by
April 8, 2025, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180-day period to regain compliance.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities
consumed 1.9 million of our cash on hand, which was primarily attributable to the net loss of 9.3 million, excluding stock-based compensation,
amortization and depreciation, non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and provision for credit losses, partially
offset by changes in working capital of 1.2 million, mostly due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, security deposit
payables, partially offset by an increase in payments on lease liabilities. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we completed seven acquisitions with capital stock and three of the seven with additional cash payments totaling 240 thousand. Each of
the seven acquisitions had an aggregate amount of 265 thousand of cash. See Note 2, Business Combinations of the Notes

from issuance of common stock of 1.9 million offset by deferred debt issuance costs, payments on notes payable, and payments to advances

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by
Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore
are not required to provide the information requested by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures
designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, as we are a newly publicly traded company
with limited resources in our finance department, and we are in the process of establishing our procedures around our disclosure controls. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(t) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits,
claims, investigations, and proceedings, including pending opposition proceedings involving patents that arise in the ordinary course
of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial
condition, or cash flows, except as set forth below. 

The occurrence of an unfavorable outcome in any specific period could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period or future periods. Other than as previously reported Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31,
2024 our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 and as described herein, we have not been and we are
not presently a party to any material pending or threatened legal proceedings. Except as described below there have not been any material
developments in our pending legal proceedings in the third quarter of 2024. 

As previously disclosed, on September 5, 2023, Mr. Anthony Freites,
who was an alleged independent contractor of La Rosa Realty, LLC from January 13, 2013 until June of 2021, filed an amended complaint
in the Circuit Court of Osceola County, Florida, seeking a jury trial and claiming that the Company breached his contract and is looking
for payment of commissions on alleged closed real estate sales as an independent contractor in the amount unspecified but allegedly including
actual damages, compensatory damages, attorney s fees, costs, and prejudgment interest. On October 12, 2023, the Company filed a
motion to dismiss Mr. Freites complaint, which is still pending. A mediation occurred on September 6, 2024. On September 10, 2024,
the case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice. 

As previously disclosed on July 19, 2024, LPT Realty, LLC commenced
a civil action in the Ninth Judicial Circuit in Orange County, Florida against La Rosa Holdings Corp; Joseph La Rosa a/k/a Joe La Rosa;
La Rosa Realty Lake Nona, Inc. n/k/a Nona Legacy Powered By La Rosa Realty, Inc.; La Rosa Realty, LLC, seeking damages, reasonable
royalty of all real estate transactions conducted by all the La Rosa defendants and injunctive relief for misappropriation of trade secrets
as to all the defendants. The court ordered a mediation to take place within 45 days. The defendants filed a response to the complaint
in the form of a motion to strike as sham, which is still pending.

Nona Legacy Powered by La Rosa Realty, Inc. commenced a civil action in the Ninth Judicial Circuit in Orange County, Florida against Olga
Norkis Fernandez Valdez a/k/a Norkis Fernandez and LPT Realty, LLC. The plaintiff seeks monetary damages caused by Norkis Fernandez due
to the breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty by Ms. Fernandez as well as injunctive relief against Ms. Fernandez. The plaintiff
also seeks damages against LPT Realty, LLC for tortious interference with a contractual relationship. The parties have signed a Mediated
Settlement Agreement dated October 18, 2024, whereby the plaintiffs agreed to have the case dismissed with prejudice.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

Other than described below, there have been no
material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed
with the SEC on April 16, 2024. 

Our failure to maintain our compliance with Nasdaq s continued
listing standards or other requirements could result in our common stock being delisted from Nasdaq, which could adversely affect our
liquidity and the trading volume and market price of our common stock and decrease or eliminate your investment. 

Our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq
Capital Market on Nasdaq under the symbol LRHC. Nasdaq requires listed issuers to comply with certain standards in order
to remain listed on its exchange. If, for any reason, Nasdaq should delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable
to obtain listing on another reputable national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which
could materially adversely affect our stockholders. 

If we violate Nasdaq s listing requirements,
or if we fail to meet any of Nasdaq s listing standards, our common stock may be delisted. A delisting of our common stock from
Nasdaq may materially impair our stockholders ability to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the
market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. The delisting of our common stock could significantly
impair our ability to raise capital and the value of your shares. 

On October 10, 2024, we received a letter from
Nasdaq notifying us that we were no longer in compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq
under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Rule ). Although Nasdaq has granted us 180 calendar days, or until April
8, 2025, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule, there can be no assurance that we will regain such compliance, and Nasdaq could
make a determination to delist our common stock. 

Any delisting determination by Nasdaq could seriously
decrease or eliminate the value of an investment in our common stock and other securities linked to our common stock. While a listing
on an over-the-counter exchange could maintain some degree of a market in our common stock, we could face substantial material adverse
consequences, including, but not limited to, the following: limited availability for market quotations for our common stock; reduced liquidity
with respect to and decreased trading prices of our common stock; a determination that shares of our common stock are penny stock 
under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, subjecting brokers trading our common stock to more stringent rules on disclosure
and the class of investors to which the broker may sell the common stock; limited news and analyst coverage for our Company, in part due
to the penny stock rules; decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future;
and potential breaches under or terminations of our agreements with current or prospective large stockholders, strategic investors and
banks. The perception among investors that we are at heightened risk of delisting could also negatively affect the market price of our
securities and trading volume of our common stock. 

Furthermore, on November 14, 2024, the closing price of our common
stock was 0.7571. Pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii), if the closing price of our common stock is 0.10 or less for 10 consecutive
trading days, we will be issued a Staff Delisting Determination by Nasdaq. If we receive a Staff Delisting Determination Letter resulting
from our common stock trading at or below 0.10 for 10 consecutive trading days, we will have 7 calendar days to request a hearing before
a Nasdaq hearings panel to review the Staff Delisting Determination, which will determine the delisting of our common stock by Nasdaq.
A hearing would then take place within 45 days of the hearing request to determine whether or not our common stock would be delisted.
If, in the future, we receive a Staff Delisting Determination there can be no assurance that we would be successful in preventing a determination
by the Nasdaq hearing panel that our stock will be delisted.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED
SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

In addition to the issuances of unregistered securities described in
the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC, in the third quarter of 2024 the Company issued the following securities
which were not registered under the Securities Act. 

On August 19, 2024, the Company issued 230,202
unregistered shares of common stock to its legal counsel, Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel LLP, in exchange for a part of amounts payable
for services rendered to the Company. 

On August 27, 2024, the Company issued 225,000
unregistered shares of common stock to a consultant as consideration for services rendered in connection with a consulting agreement,
dated February 20, 2024. 

On September 23, 2024, the Company issued 230,769
unregistered shares of common stock to a consultant for services rendered pursuant to the marketing services agreement, dated September
19, 2024. 

On September 27, 2024, the Company issued to an
unaffiliated private investor a promissory note in the principal amount of 200,000, that we used for our general corporate purposes. 

Unless otherwise noted, the securities above
were issued pursuant to the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) and/or Rule 506 of Regulation
D promulgated under the Securities Act, in light of the fact that none of the issuances involved a public offering of securities and
no solicitation or advertisements for such securities were made by any party.

equal to or more than 50 of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition
or acquisitions provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (iii), the following will not constitute a change in the

3. Stock Subject to the Plan. 

(a) Stock Subject to the Plan. Subject to adjustment

in Section 3 (e) of the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be awarded and sold under the Plan is equal to 12,000,000
Shares. In addition, Shares may become available for issuance under Sections 3 (b) and 3 (e) of the Plan. The Shares may be authorized,

become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right

Shares or Performance Units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company, such Shares will become available for future
grant under the Plan. Shares used to pay the tax and/or exercise price of an Award will become available for future grant or sale under
the Plan. To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing
the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3(b), subject to
adjustment provided in Section 14 hereof, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options
will equal the aggregate Share number stated in Section 3(a) above, plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code, any Shares
that become available for issuance under the Plan under this Section 3(b). 

(c) Share Reserve. The Company, during the term
of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of
the Plan. 

(d) Limitation on Number of Shares Subject to
Awards. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the maximum aggregate amount of cash that may be paid in cash during
any calendar year (measured from the date of any payment) with respect to one or more Awards payable in cash shall be 100,000. 

(e) Automatic Share Reserve Increase. Subject
to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company as provided in Section 15, the number of Shares available for issuance under
the Plan will be increased on the first day of each Fiscal Year beginning with the 2025 Fiscal Year, in an amount equal to the least of
(a) 500,000 Shares, (b) a number of Shares equal to four percent (4 of the total number of shares of all classes of common stock of
the Company outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding Fiscal Year, or (c) such number of Shares determined by the Administrator
no later than the last day of the immediately preceding Fiscal Year.

4. Administration of the Plan. 

(a) Procedure. 

(i) Multiple Administrator. The Administrator
of this Plan shall be a Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

(ii) Section 162(m). To the extent that the Administrator
determines it to be desirable to qualify Awards granted hereunder as performance-based compensation within the meaning of
Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan will be administered by a Committee of two (2) or more outside directors within the
meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. 

(iii) Rule 16b-3. To the extent desirable to qualify
transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated hereunder will be structured to satisfy the requirements
for exemption under Rule 16b-3. 

(b) Powers of the Administrator. Subject to the
provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator
will have the authority, in its discretion: 

(i) to determine the Fair Market Value 

(ii) to select the Service Providers to whom Awards
may be granted hereunder 

(iii) to determine the number of Shares to be
covered by each Award granted hereunder 

(iv) to approve forms of Award Agreements for
use under the Plan 

(v) to determine the terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Award granted hereunder 

(vi) to institute an Exchange Program and to determine
the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, for (1) the surrender or cancellation of outstanding Awards in
exchange for Awards of the same type, Awards of a different type, and/or cash, (2) the transfer of outstanding Awards to a financial institution
or other person or entity, or (3) the reduction of the exercise price of outstanding Awards 

(vii) to construe and interpret the terms of the
Plan and Awards granted pursuant to the Plan 

(viii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable
foreign laws or for qualifying for favorable tax treatment under applicable foreign laws 

(ix) to modify or amend each Award (subject to
Section 20(c) hereof), including but not limited to the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of
Awards 

(x) to allow Participants to satisfy withholding
tax obligations in a manner described in Section 16 hereof 

(xi) to authorize any person to execute on behalf
of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator 

(xii) to allow a Participant to defer the receipt
of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award pursuant to such procedures
as the Administrator may determine and 

Amended and Restated La Rosa Holdings Corp. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan 

6 

(xiii) to make all other determinations deemed
necessary or advisable for administering the Plan. 

(c) Effect of Administrator s Decision.
The Administrator s decisions, determinations, and interpretations will be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders
of Awards. 

5. Eligibility. Non-statutory Stock Options, Restricted
Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Units, Performance Shares, and such other cash or stock awards as
the Administrator determines may be granted to Service Providers. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees. 

6. Stock Options. 

(a) Limitations. 

(i) Each Option will be designated in the Award
Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-statutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent
that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by
the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds 100,000 (U.S.), such Options
will be treated as Non-statutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account
in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect
to such Shares is granted. 

(ii) The Administrator will have complete discretion
to determine the number of Shares subject to an Option granted to any Participant. 

(b) Term of Option. The Administrator will determine
the term of each Option in its sole discretion provided, however, that the term will be no more than ten (10) years from the date
of grant thereof. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option
is granted, owns stock representing more than 10 of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent
or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided
in the Award Agreement. 

(c) Option Exercise Price and Consideration. 

(i) Exercise Price. The per share exercise price
for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option will be determined by the Administrator, but will be no less than 100 of
the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. In addition, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who,
at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than 10 of the voting power of all classes of stock of
the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110 of the Fair Market Value per Share on
the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(c), Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price
of less than 100 of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent
with, Section 424(a) of the Code. 

(ii) Waiting Period and Exercise Dates. At the
time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions
that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised. 

Amended and Restated La Rosa Holdings Corp. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan 

7 

(iii) Form of Consideration. The Administrator
will determine the acceptable form(s) of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Laws. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration at
the time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of: (1) cash (2) check (3) promissory note, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Laws, (4) other Shares, provided that such Shares have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate
exercise price of the Shares as to which such Option will be exercised and provided further that accepting such Shares will not result
in any adverse accounting consequences to the Company, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion (5) consideration
received by the Company under cashless exercise program (whether through a broker or otherwise) implemented by the Company in connection
with the Plan (6) by net exercise, (7) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted
by Applicable Laws, or (8) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. In making its determination as to the type of consideration
to accept, the Administrator will consider if acceptance of such consideration may be reasonably expected to benefit the Company. 

(d) Exercise of Option. 

(i) Procedure for Exercise Rights as a Stockholder.
Any Option granted hereunder will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined
by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. 

An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company
receives: (i) notice of exercise (in such form as the Administrator specifies from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise
the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (together with any applicable withholding
taxes). Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award
Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the
Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry
on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other
rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares subject to an Option, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company
will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other
right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 15 hereof. 

(ii) Termination of Relationship as a Service
Provider. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant s termination as the result of the Participant s
death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement
to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option
as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for
three (3) months following the Participant s termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination
the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to
the Plan. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the
Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant s Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within
such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event
later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award
Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for six (6) months following the Participant s termination. Unless otherwise provided
by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by
the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within
the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

(iv) Death of Participant. If a Participant dies
while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent
that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such
Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant s designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated
prior to Participant s death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant,
then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant s estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option
is transferred pursuant to the Participant s will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of
a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for six (6) months following Participant s death. Unless
otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares
covered by the unvested portion of the Option will continue to vest in accordance with the Award Agreement. If the Option is not so exercised
within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period)
or in a combination thereof. 

(f) Cancellation of Performance Units/Shares.
On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned or unvested Performance Units/Shares will be forfeited to the Company, and
again will be available for grant under the Plan. 

(g) Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions. For
purposes of qualifying grants of Performance Units/Shares as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the
Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals
will be set by the Administrator on or before the Determination Date. In granting Performance Units/Shares which are intended to qualify
under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate
to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals). 

11. Performance-Based Compensation Under Code
Section 162(m). 

(a) General. If the Administrator, in its discretion,
decides to grant an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), the provisions
of this Section 11 will control over any contrary provision in the Plan provided, however, that the Administrator may in its discretion
grant Awards that are not intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code to such
Participants that are based on Performance Goals or other specific criteria or goals but that do not satisfy the requirements of this
Section 11. 

(b) Performance Goals. The granting and/or vesting
of Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units and other incentives under the Plan may
be made subject to the attainment of performance goals relating to one or more business criteria within the meaning of Code Section 162(m)
and may provide for a targeted level or levels of achievement Performance Goals including (i) earnings per Share, (ii)
operating cash flow, (iii) operating income, (iv) profit after-tax, (v) profit before-tax, (vi) return on assets, (vii) return on equity,
(viii) return on sales, (ix) revenue, and (x) total stockholder return. Any Performance Goals may be used to measure the performance of
the Company as a whole or a business unit of the Company and may be measured relative to a peer group or index. The Performance Goals
may differ from Participant to Participant and from Award to Award. Prior to the Determination Date, the Administrator will determine
whether any significant element(s) will be included in or excluded from the calculation of any Performance Goal with respect to any Participant. 

Amended and Restated La Rosa Holdings Corp. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan 

12 

(c) Procedures. To the extent necessary to comply
with the performance-based compensation provisions of Code Section 162(m), with respect to any Award granted subject to Performance Goals,
within the first twenty-five percent (25 of the Performance Period, but in no event more than ninety (90) days following the commencement
of any Performance Period (or such other time as may be required or permitted by Code Section 162(m)), the Administrator will, in writing,
(i) designate one or more Participants to whom an Award will be made, (ii) select the Performance Goals applicable to the Performance
Period, (iii) establish the Performance Goals, and amounts of such Awards, as applicable, which may be earned for such Performance Period,
and (iv) specify the relationship between Performance Goals and the amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Participant
for such Performance Period. Following the completion of each Performance Period, the Administrator will certify in writing whether the
applicable Performance Goals have been achieved for such Performance Period. In determining the amounts earned by a Participant, the Administrator
will have the right to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account
additional factors that the Administrator may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance
Period. A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals
for such period are achieved. 

(d) Additional Limitations. Notwithstanding any
other provision of the Plan, any Award which is granted to a Participant and is intended to constitute qualified performance based compensation
under Code Section 162(m) will be subject to any additional limitations set forth in the Code (including any amendment to Section 162(m))
or any regulations and ruling issued thereunder that are requirements for qualification as qualified performance-based compensation as
described in Section 162(m) of the Code, and the Plan will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements. 

12. Compliance with Code Section 409A. Awards
will be designed and operated in such a manner that they are either exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of
Code Section 409A, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. The Plan and each Award Agreement under
the Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A and will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent,
except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. To the extent that an Award or payment, or the settlement
or deferral thereof, is subject to Code Section 409A the Award will be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will meet the
requirements of Code Section 409A, such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral will not be subject to the additional tax or interest
applicable under Code Section 409A. 

13. Leaves of Absence. Unless the Administrator
provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. A Service Provider will
not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company, or (ii) transfers between locations of the
Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed three
(3) months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of
a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then six (6) months and one day following the commencement of such leave
any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes
as a Non-statutory Stock Option. 

14. Transferability of Awards. Unless determined
otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other
than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant.
If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award may only be transferred (i) by will, (ii) by the laws of descent and distribution,
(iii) to a revocable trust, or (iii) as permitted by Rule 701 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

15. Adjustments Dissolution or Liquidation 
Merger or Change in Control. 

(a) Adjustments. In the event that any dividend
or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse
stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities
of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to
prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, will adjust the
number and class of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan and/or the number, class, and price of Shares covered by each outstanding
Award, and the numerical Share limits set forth in Sections 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 hereof. 

(b) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution
or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such
proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation
of such proposed action. 

(c) Change in Control. In the event of a merger
of the Company with or into another corporation or other entity or a Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be treated as the
Administrator determines (subject to the provisions of the proceeding paragraph) without a Participant s consent, including, without
limitation, that (i) Awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent Awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation
(the Successor Corporation (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and
prices (ii) upon written notice to a Participant, that the Participant s Awards will terminate upon or immediately prior to
the consummation of such merger or Change in Control (iii) outstanding Awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable, or payable,
or restrictions applicable to an Award will lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon consummation of such merger or Change in Control,
and, to the extent the Administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such merger or Change in
Control (iv) (A) the termination of an Award in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that
would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant s rights as of the date of the occurrence
of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the Administrator determines
in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant s rights,
then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment), or (B) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property
selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion or (v) any combination of the foregoing. In taking any of the actions permitted
under this subsection (c), the Administrator will not be obligated to treat all Awards, all Awards held by a Participant, or all Awards
of the same type, similarly. 

In the event that the Successor Corporation does
not assume or substitute for the Award, the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions
on Restricted Stock will lapse, and, with respect to Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units, all Performance
Goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an Option
or Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted for in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant
in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of time determined
by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period. 

Amended and Restated La Rosa Holdings Corp. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan 

14 

For the purposes of this subsection (c), an Award
will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject
to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or,
in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Performance Share or
Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger
or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered
a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares) provided, however,
that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the Successor Corporation, the Administrator
may, with the consent of the Successor Corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock
Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case
of Performance Units, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Performance Units by the per share consideration
received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the Successor Corporation equal in fair market
value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 15(c)
to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered
assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant s consent provided,
however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the Successor Corporation s post-Change in Control corporate structure
will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption. In the case of an Award providing for the payment of deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, any payment of such deferred compensation by reason of a Change in Control shall be made only if
the Change in Control is one described in subsection (a)(2)(A)(v) of Section 409A and the guidance thereunder and shall be paid consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A. If any deferred compensation that would otherwise be payable by reason of a Change in Control cannot
be paid by reason of the immediately preceding sentence, it shall be paid as soon as practicable thereafter consistent with the requirements
of Section 409A, as determined by the Administrator. 

16. Tax Withholding. 

(a) Withholding Requirements. Prior to the delivery
of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold,
or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including
the Participant s FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof). 

(b) Withholding Arrangements. The Administrator,
in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax
withholding obligation, in whole or in part by (without limitation) (i) paying cash, (ii) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise
deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld, (iii) delivering to the Company
already- owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, or (iv) selling a sufficient number of Shares
otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through
a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld. The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include
any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using
the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that
the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined
as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld. 

17. No Effect on Employment or Service. Neither
the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant s relationship as a Service
Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant s right or the Company s right to terminate
such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws. 

18. Date of Grant. The date of grant of an Award
will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as
is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the
date of such grant. 

Amended and Restated La Rosa Holdings Corp. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan

19. Term of the Plan. The La Rosa Holdings Corp.
2022 Equity Incentive Plan was originally adopted by the Board and approved by the stockholders of the Company on the Original Effective
Date. It will continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years, i.e. until January 10, 2032, unless terminated earlier under Section 20
hereof. 

20. Amendment and Termination of the Plan. 

(a) Amendment and Termination. The Administrator
may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan. Any Plan amendment that increases the total number of Shares reserved for
issuance pursuant to incentive awards or reduces the minimum exercise price for options or exchange of options for other incentive awards,
shall be authorized by the stockholders of the Company within one (1) year. 

(b) Stockholder Approval. The Company will obtain
stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws. 

(c) Effect of Amendment or Termination. No amendment,
alteration, suspension, or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between
the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of
the Plan will not affect the Administrator s ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted
under the Plan prior to the date of such termination. 

21. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. 

(a) Legal Compliance. Shares will not be issued
pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable
Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. 

(b) Investment Representations. As a condition
to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such
exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if,
in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required. 

(c) Restrictive Legends. All Award Agreements
and all securities of the Company issued pursuant thereto shall bear such legends regarding restrictions on transfer and such other legends
as the appropriate officer of the Corporation shall determine to be necessary or advisable to comply with applicable securities and other
laws. 

22. Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability
of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company s counsel
to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure
to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained. 

23. Stockholder Approval. The Plan will be subject
to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. Such stockholder
approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws. In the event that stockholder approval is not
obtained within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board, the Plan and all Awards granted hereunder shall be
void ab initio and of no effect. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no Awards shall be exercisable until the date of such
stockholder approval. 

23. Notification of Election Under Section 83(b)
of the Code. If any Service Provider shall, in connection with the acquisition of Shares under the Plan, make the election permitted under
Section 83(b) of the Code, such Service Provider shall notify the Company of such election within ten (10) days of filing notice of the
election with the Internal Revenue Service and provide the Company with a copy thereof, in addition to any filing and a notification required
pursuant to regulations issued under the authority of Section 83(b) of the Code. A Service Provider shall not be permitted to make a Section
83(b) election with respect to an Award of a Restricted Stock Unit. 

24. Notification Upon Disqualifying Disposition
Under Section 421(b) of the Code. Each Service Provider shall notify the Company of any disposition of Shares issued pursuant to the exercise
of an Incentive Stock Option under the circumstances described in Section 421(b) of the Code (relating to certain disqualifying dispositions),
within ten (10) days of such disposition. 

25. Choice of Law. The Plan and all rules and
determinations made and taken pursuant hereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada, to the extent not preempted by federal
law, and construed accordingly.

may sell, and may, in the Compensation Committee s absolute discretion, grant, shares of the Company s common stock or Restricted
Stock Units RSU to all agents and brokers in good standing with the Company, including each of the Company s
majority owned subsidiaries (the Majority Subsidiaries ), who are defined as consultants under the 2022
Plan Participants as a part of their, or as additional, compensation. This Agent Plan has two components: the (i)
Agent Equity Program and the (ii) Discretionary Bonus Program, which are described in more detail in Section 4 below. 

2. Voluntary Participation : All participation in this Agent Plan is voluntary and no agent
or broker will be penalized for not participating in this Agent Plan. Agents and brokers may participate in any one or more or none of
the Agent Plan s programs. All Participants, who are eligible pursuant to Section 3 hereof, will be automatically considered to
be participating in this Agent Plan. This Agent Plan will be administered electronically through the Company s Stock Plan Administrator
software SPA ). Upon the Participant achieving the targets described in the Section 4 hereof or upon decision of
the Compensation Committee pursuant to the Section 5 hereof, the SPA will send a Participant a binding RSU award agreement between the
Participant and the Company as set forth herein (the Agreement once the eligibility of such Participant pursuant
to Section 3 hereof is confirmed by the Company. The date that the Agreement is executed by the Participant shall be the effective date
of the Agreement Effective Date ). Participants are urged to seek legal advice before signing the Agreement. A Participant
has a right to refuse the award. A failure of the Participant to sign the Agreement within thirty (30) days will be considered a decision
of the Participant to not participate in this Agent Plan and the grant will be voided by the Company. 

3. Eligibility : All agents and brokers in good standing with the Company and each of the Company s
Majority Subsidiaries (as described in that certain independent contractor agreement signed by such agent and the Company or its Majority
Subsidiary) are eligible to participate in this Agent Plan unless they are licensed brokers, holding an equity interest in brokerage businesses,
in which the Company also holds an equity interest. 

In addition, employees or independent
contractors hired by the Company as team leaders whose job description specifically includes recruitment functions are precluded from
participating in the recruiting portion of the Agent Equity Program described in Section 4(c). Only individuals who provide their social
security number to the Company s SPA are eligible. No business entities can participate in this Agent Plan. 

4. Agent Equity Program : The Company s Agent Equity Program (the Agent Equity
Program includes the following three components: 

a. Blue Diamond : 

Participants in the Agent Equity Program
will be eligible to receive an RSU who: (i) close more than 20 sale transactions or make more than 6,000,000 gross sales
volume in verified listing or buy-side transactions (the Milestones , and each a Milestone with
the Company and its Majority Subsidiaries in a given calendar year, and (ii) remain with the Company for at least 12 consecutive months
thereafter. Such RSUs will be granted to qualifying Participants on the last day of the month of the one-year anniversary of the date
the Company verifies a Milestone has been achieved (the Blue Diamond Grant Date ). The RSU will be equivalent to 2,000
on the Blue Diamond Grant Date, and the RSU value will be converted into shares of the Company s common stock based on the volume
weighted average closing price VWAP of the month of the Blue Diamond Grant Date based on the Company s common
stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rounded down to a whole share. For example, if the Company verifies a Milestone has been achieved on
April 12, 2024, the Company will grant the Participant s RSU on April 30, 2025. RSUs will vest in 24 ratable installments in whole
shares starting the month following the Blue Diamond Grant Date. Participants who terminate their relationship with the Company during
the vesting period will forfeit any unvested RSUs. If the Participant is required upon the commission plan on which they are enrolled,
but does not pay his or her annual or monthly dues pursuant to that certain independent contractor agreement signed by such agent and
the Company or its Majority Subsidiary within 60 days of the due date, all remaining unvested RSUs will be forfeited. The Blue Diamond
program shall be effective as of January 1, 2023, meaning agents who meet the Milestones in the calendar year 2023, and each year thereafter,
are eligible to receive an RSU. 

b. Ultimate Plan Cap : 

Participants in the Agent Equity Program
who enroll or renew under the Ultimate Plan 90-10 commission plan or the Ultimate Plan Business Builder commission plan (the Profit
Share Plans ), both of which have terms of 12 months from the agent start date, will be eligible to receive an RSU (i) once they
cap their 10 portion of their commission in accordance with the terms of the Profit Share Plans and (ii) remain with the Company for
at least 12 consecutive months thereafter. Such RSUs will be granted to qualifying Participants on the last day of the month of the one-year
anniversary of the date the Company verifies the agent achieved their cap (the UP Cap Grant Date ). The RSU will be
equivalent to 10,000 on the UP Cap Grant Date, and the RSU value will be converted into shares based on the VWAP of the month of the
UP Cap Grant Date based on the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rounded down to a whole share. For example, if
the Company verifies the agent capped their 10 commission in accordance with the terms of the Profit Share Plans on May 15, 2024, the
Company will grant the Participant s RSU on May 31, 2025. RSUs will vest in 24 ratable installments in whole shares starting the
month following the UP Cap Grant Date. Participants who terminate their relationship with the Company during the vesting period will forfeit
any unvested RSUs. If the Participant is required upon the terms of the Profit Share Plans, but does not pay his or her annual or monthly
dues pursuant to the independent contractor agreement signed by such agent and the Company or its Majority Subsidiary within 60 days of
the due date, all remaining unvested RSUs will be forfeited. The Ultimate Plan Cap program shall be effective as of January 1, 2024, meaning
agents who enroll or renew under the Profit Share Plans on or after January 1, 2024 and meet other requirements of this program, will
be eligible to receive an RSU. 

2 

c. Recruiting : 

I. Participants in the Agent Equity Program will be eligible
to receive an RSU if they (i) recruit agents who become agents of the Company and remain agents of the Company for at least 12 consecutive
months, and (ii) remain with the Company for at least 12 consecutive months. Such RSU will be granted to a qualifying Participant on
the last day of the month of the one-year anniversary of the date the Company verifies the such Participant recruited the agent and is
still with the Company (the Recruitment Grant Date ). The RSU will be equivalent to 200 on the Recruitment Grant
Date for each agent recruited, and the RSU value will be converted into shares based on the VWAP of the month of the Recruitment Grant
Date based on the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rounded down to a whole share. For example, if the Company
verifies a Participant recruited an agent on June 20, 2024 and that agent is still with the Company one year later, the Company will
grant the Participant s RSU on June 30, 2025. RSUs will vest in 24 ratable installments in whole shares starting the month following
the Recruitment Grant Date. Such RSUs shall be granted for every agent recruited by a Participant that meet the eligibility criteria.
Participants who terminate their relationship with the Company during the vesting period will forfeit any unvested RSUs. If the Participant
is required upon the terms of the commission plan on which they are enrolled, but does not pay his or her annual or monthly dues pursuant
to the independent contractor agreement signed by such agent and the Company or its Majority Subsidiary within 60 days of the due date,
all remaining unvested RSUs will be forfeited. The Recruiting program shall be effective as of January 1, 2024, meaning agents who recruit
agents on or after January 1, 2024 will be eligible to receive an RSU. 

II. A Participant who (i) recruits ten (10) agents in one calendar year who become agents of the Company and
remain agents of the Company for at least 12 consecutive months, and (ii) remains with the Company for at least 12 consecutive months
after the last agent was recruited by this Participant, will receive an additional value of 8,000 on the tenth RSU. All terms will be
applied pursuant to Section I. above. If such Participant continues to recruit additional agents in the same year, every multiple of ten
(10) agents recruited in one fiscal year will be enhanced with the 8,000 additional value on an RSU. 

5. Discretionary Bonus Program : All Participants in the Discretionary Bonus Program (the Bonus
Program are to be eligible for a grant of an equity award in the Compensation Committee s discretion. The Compensation
Committee or its designee may, from time to time, review the performance of Participants who achieve outstanding results in their endeavors
for the Company and may grant an equity award to such Participant without payment by such Participant. All equity awards granted under
the Bonus Program will vest based on the terms of the grant certificate. Participants who terminate their relationship with the Company
during the vesting period will forfeit any unvested equity awards. If the Participant is required upon the terms of the commission plan
on which the Participant is enrolled, but does not pay his or her annual or monthly dues pursuant to the agreement signed by such Participant
and the Company or its Majority Subsidiary within 60 days of the due date, all remaining unvested equity awards will be forfeited. 

6. Death of Participant : Any distribution or delivery to be made to Participant under the Agreement,
if Participant is then deceased, will be made to Participant s designated beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives Participant,
the administrator or executor of Participant s estate. 

3 

7. Responsibility for Taxes : Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken
by the Company or, if different, Participant s employer or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company to which Participant is providing
services (together, the Service Recipients ), the ultimate liability for any tax and/or social insurance liability
obligations and requirements in connection with the RSUs or underlying shares of common stock, including, without limitation, (i) all
federal, state, and local taxes (including Participant s Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) obligations) that are required
to be withheld by any Service Recipient or other payment of tax-related items related to Participant s participation in this Agent
Plan and legally applicable to Participant, (ii) Participant s and, to the extent required by any Service Recipient, the Service
Recipient s fringe benefit tax liability, if any, associated with the grant, vesting, or release from escrow of RSUs or underlying
shares of common stock, the filing of an 83(b) election with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding the RSUs or underlying shares
of common stock, or the sale of shares, and (iii) any other Service Recipient taxes the responsibility for which Participant has,
or has agreed to bear, with respect to the RSUs or underlying shares of common stock (or release from escrow thereof or issuance of shares
thereunder) (collectively, the Tax Obligations ), is and remains Participant s sole responsibility and may exceed
the amount actually withheld by the applicable Service Recipient(s). Participant further acknowledges that no Service Recipient (A) makes
any representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the RSUs or underlying
shares of common stock, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or release from escrow of the RSUs or underlying shares of common
stock, the filing of an 83(b) Election (as defined below) with respect to the RSUs or underlying shares of common stock, the subsequent
sale of shares acquired pursuant to the Agreement and the receipt of any dividends or other distributions, and (B) makes any commitment
to and is under any obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs or underlying shares of common stock to reduce
or eliminate Participant s liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant is subject
to Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event,
as applicable, Participant acknowledges that the applicable Service Recipient(s) (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to
withhold or account for Withholding Obligations (as defined below) in more than one jurisdiction. If Participant fails to make satisfactory
arrangements for the payment of any required withholding obligations under applicable law or regulation at the time of the applicable
taxable event, Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares. Participant, by signing
this enrollment form, certifies that: Participant is not subject to backup withholding because (i) Participant is exempt from backup withholding,
or (ii) Participant has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that Participant is not subject to backup withholding, or
(iii) the IRS has notified Participant that Participant is no longer subject to backup withholding. 

8. Custody of Shares : All shares of common stock being granted pursuant to the 2022 Plan are
registered pursuant to the Registration Statement on the Form S-8 filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
on October 20, 2023. All shares of common stock being granted pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2022 Plan to be effective as of the

the records of the Company, and delivered to Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance,
recordation, and delivery, the Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such shares
and receipt of dividends and distributions on such shares. 

4 

12. No Guarantee of Continued Service : The vesting of the RSUs pursuant to the vesting schedule
hereof is earned only by continuing as an agent or broker through the applicable vesting date(s), which unless provided otherwise under
applicable laws is at the will of the applicable Service Recipient and not through the act of being hired, being granted the RSU or acquiring
shares hereunder. Participant further acknowledges and agrees that the Agreement, the transactions contemplated thereunder and the vesting
schedule set forth therein do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an agent or broker for the vesting
period, for any period, or at all, and shall not interfere in any way with Participant s right or the right of any Service Recipient
to terminate Participant s relationship as an agent or broker, subject to applicable law, which termination, unless provided otherwise
under applicable law, may be at any time, with or without cause.

and privileges conferred hereby will not be transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process until such shares shall have vested in accordance
with the provisions of the Agreement. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of the unvested
RSUs subject to the Agreement, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment,

rights thereunder.

successors, and assigns. The rights and obligations of the Participant under the Agreement may be assigned only with the prior written
consent of the Company. 

18. No Waiver : Either party s failure to enforce any provision or provisions of the Agreement
shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing each

of either party s right to assert all other legal remedies available under the circumstances.
