 . Banzai is a leading enterprise SaaS Video Engagement platform used by marketers to power webinars, trainings, virtual events, and on-demand video content. Reverse Stock Split No cash or fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and instead the Company will round up to the next whole share in lieu of issuing factional shares that would have been issued in the reverse split. Proportional adjustments were made to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of the Company s outstanding stock options and warrants, the exercise price or conversion price (as applicable) of the Company s outstanding stock options and warrants, and the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company s equity incentive plan. All Class A Common Stock share and per share information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the Reverse Stock Split. Close of the Merger On December 14, 2023 (the Closing Date ), 7GC Co. Holdings Inc. ("7GC"), our predecessor company, consummated the business combination pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of December 8, 2022 (the Original Merger Agreement ), by and among 7GC, Banzai International, Inc. Legacy Banzai ), 7GC Merger Sub I, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of 7GC First Merger Sub ), and 7GC Merger Sub II, LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of 7GC Second Merger Sub ), as amended by the Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 4, 2023 (the Merger Agreement Amendment and, together with the Original Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement ), by and between 7GC and Legacy Banzai. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between 7GC and Legacy Banzai was effected through (a) the merger of First Merger Sub with and into Legacy Banzai, with Legacy Banzai surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of 7GC (Legacy Banzai, in its capacity as the surviving corporation of the merger, the Surviving Corporation (the First Merger and (b) the subsequent merger of the Surviving Corporation with and into Second Merger Sub, with Second Merger Sub being the surviving entity of the Second Merger, which ultimately resulted in Legacy Banzai becoming a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of 7GC (the Second Merger and, together with the First Merger, the Mergers and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the Merger ). On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Merger (the Closing ), 7GC changed its name to Banzai International, Inc. Although 7GC was the legal acquirer of Legacy Banzai in the merger, Legacy Banzai is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the historical financial statements of Legacy Banzai became the basis for the historical financial statements of the Company upon the closing of the merger. As a result, the financial statements included here reflect (i) the historical operating results of Legacy Banzai prior to the merger; (ii) the combined results of 7GC and Legacy Banzai following the close of the merger; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Legacy Banzai at their historical cost and (iv) the Legacy Banzai s equity structure for all periods presented, as affected by the recapitalization presentation after completion of the merger. The aggregate consideration payable to securityholders of Legacy Banzai at the Closing consisted of a number of shares of Class A Common Stock or shares of Class B Common Stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Class A Common Stock or shares of Class B Common Stock that would otherwise have been payable to any Legacy Banzai securityholders, equal to .

million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used approximately million in cash for operating activities. The Company has incurred recurring net losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date these financial statements were issued. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders and debt holders. Specifically, continuation is contingent on the Company's ability to obtain necessary equity or debt financing to continue operations, and ultimately the Company's ability to generate profit from sales and positive operating cash flows, which is not assured. The Company s plans include obtaining future debt and equity financings associated with the close of the Merger described in Note 4 - Reverse Merger Capitalization with 7GC Co. Holdings Inc.. If the Company is unsuccessful in completing these planned transactions, it may be required to reduce its spending rate to align with expected revenue levels and cash reserves, although there can be no guarantee that it will be successful in doing so. Accordingly, the Company may be required to raise additional cash through debt or equity transactions. It may not be able to secure financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. As a result, management s plans cannot be considered probable and thus do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. On , the Company committed to a reduction in force (the "Reduction") intended to decrease expenses and maintain a streamlined organization to support key programs and customers, and that is expected to conserve cash. As part of the Reduction, the Company reduced its headcount by employees, which represented approximately of the Company's full-time employees as of September 15, 2024. The cost-saving measures from the Reduction are expected to reduce annual by approximately an additional million beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company estimates that it will incur total restructuring charges of approximately million, including severance payments in connection with the Reduction. The Company completed the reduction in October, 2024 . These accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Effect of Merger on Class A and Class B Common Stock Upon the Close of the Merger, holders of Legacy Banzai common stock and Series A preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock in an amount determined by application of the Exchange Ratio. As noted above, the equity structure has been restated in all comparable periods, prior to the Merger, up to December 14, 2023, to reflect the number of shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, issued to Legacy Banzai s stockholders in connection with the Merger.

Bifurcated Embedded Derivative Liabilities The fair value of the embedded put options, relating to the Convertible Notes - Related Party, Convertible Notes, and Term and Convertible Notes (CP BF) , was determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Estimating fair values of embedded conversion features requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. Because the embedded conversion features are initially and subsequently carried at fair values, the Company s consolidated statements of operations will reflect the volatility in these estimate and assumption changes. On December 14, 2023, all outstanding principal and accrued interest, including the carrying value of any related embedded derivative, related to the Related Party Convertible Notes and Third Party Convertible Notes converted into the Company s Class A Common Stock pursuant to the close of the Merger Agreement.

Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFE) During 2021, the Company entered into Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFE) arrangements (the "SAFEs"). In the event of an Equity Financing (as defined in the SAFEs agreements), the SAFEs will automatically convert into shares of the Company s common or preferred stock at a discount of of the per share price of the shares offered in the Equity Financing (the Discount Price ). In the event of a Liquidity Event, SPAC Transaction or Dissolution Event (all terms as defined in the SAFEs agreements), the holders of the SAFEs will be entitled to receive cash or shares of the Company s common or preferred stock. The number of shares required to be issued to settle the SAFEs at the equity financing is variable, because that number will be determined by the discounted fair value of the Company's equity shares on the date of settlement (i.e., Discount Price). Regardless of the fair value of the shares on the date of settlement, the holder will receive a fixed monetary value based on the Purchase Amount of the SAFE. If there is a Liquidity Event or SPAC Transaction before the settlement or termination of the SAFEs, the SAFEs will automatically be entitled to receive a portion of Proceeds, due and payable immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of such Liquidity Event or SPAC Transaction, equal to the greater of (i) two times (2x) the Purchase Amount (the Cash-Out Amount or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price (as defined in the SAFEs agreements). Refer to Note 13 - Simple Agreements for Future Equity for additional information related to the Company's SAFEs. The fair value of the SAFEs was determined using a scenario-based method for the pre-modification SAFE's and a Monte Carlo simulation method for the post-modification SAFEs.

The Company determined that the Company was granted a concession by the lender based on the decrease of the effective borrowing rate on the First Amendment. Accordingly, the Company accounted for the First Amendment as a troubled debt restructuring. As a result, the Company accounted for the troubled debt restructuring by calculating a new effective interest rate for the First Amendment based on the carrying amount of the debt and the present value of the revised future cash flow payment stream. The troubled debt restructuring did not result in recognition of a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations but does impact interest expense recognized in the future.

Pursuant to which in principal borrowed under the Alco September and November Promissory Notes, the Sponsor agreed to forfeit one share of 7GC Class B Common Stock held by the Sponsor, in exchange for the right of Alco to receive one New Banzai Class A Share. For each in principal borrowed under the December Note, the Sponsor agreed to forfeit shares of 7GC Class B Common Stock held by the Sponsor, in exchange for the right of Alco to receive New Banzai Class A Shares.

Pursuant to the Alco Share Transfer Agreements, the shares are subject to an -day lock-up period upon issuance of the shares. For the Alco Share Transfer Agreements, the Company considered the guidance under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the Investor Shares underlying each of the Share Transfer Agreements described above, met the definition of a freestanding financial instrument and are not precluded from being considered indexed to the Company s common stock. The Company determined that these shares represent a freestanding equity contract issued to the lender, resulting in a discount recorded on the notes when they are issued. Equity-classified contracts are initially measured at fair value (or allocated value). Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized if the contracts continue to be classified in equity. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing various put option models in estimating the discount lack of marketability (the DLOM applied to the public share price as the shares underlying each of the Share Transfer Agreements are subject to a lock-up period pursuant to each agreement, to estimate the fair value of the shares transferred. Option pricing models assume that the cost to purchase a stock option relates directly to the measurement of the DLOM. The logic behind these models is that investors may be able to quantify this price risk, due to lack of marketability, over a particular holding period where price volatility is usually estimated as a proxy for risk. The inputs and assumptions utilized in the fair value estimation included the Company s stock price on the measurement date, a DLOM as described above, the number of shares pursuant to each Share Transfer Agreement, and a probability weighted factor for the Company s expected percentage of completing its Business Combination, at each Share Transfer Agreement date.

Pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815"), the Company will therefore recognize the SEPA Option as an asset or liability, measured at fair value at the date of issuance, December 14, 2023, and in subsequent reporting periods, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The SEPA Option was determined to have a fair value of on the date of issuance as well as at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. In connection with the execution of the SEPA, the Company agreed to pay a commitment fee of to Yorkville at the earlier of (i) March 14, 2024 or (ii) the termination of the SEPA, which will be payable, at the option of the Company, in cash or shares of Class A common stock through an Advance (the Deferred Fee ). In March 2024 the Company issued Class A common stock as payment for the Deferred Fee. Pursuant to the terms of the SEPA, at any time that there is a balance outstanding under the Yorkville Promissory Notes, Yorkville has the right to receive shares to pay down the principal balance, and may select the timing and delivery of such shares (via an Investor Notice ), in an amount up to the outstanding principal balance on the Yorkville Promissory Notes at a purchase price equal to the lower

per share of Class A common stock (the Fixed Price ), or (ii) of the lowest daily Volume Weighted Average Price VWAP of the Class A common stock on Nasdaq during the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the Investor Notice date or other date of determination (the Variable Price ). The Variable Price shall not be lower than per share (the Floor Price ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may reduce the Floor Price to any amount via written notice to Yorkville, provided that such amount is no more than of the closing price on the Trading Day immediately prior to the time of such reduction and no greater than per share of Class A common stock (the Conversion Price ). At any time that there is a balance outstanding under the Yorkville Promissory Notes, the Company is not permitted to issue Advance Notices under the SEPA unless an Amortization Event has occurred under the terms of the Yorkville Promissory Notes agreement. There were no Advance Notices issued pursuant to the SEPA during the period ended September 30, 2024 or as of the date that these financial statements were issued, apart from the Premium Advance which was issued pursuant to the terms of the Amended Debt Agreement (see Note 11 - Debt ).

In addition, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that remain available to be awarded under the Purchase Plan, will automatically increase on January 1 of each year for a period of commencing on January 1, 2024 and ending on , in an amount equal to the lesser of one percent of the total number of shares of the fully diluted common stock determined as of December 31 of the preceding year, or a number of shares of common stock equal to two hundred percent of the initial share reserve of 11,444. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and shares of common stock remain available to be purchased under the Purchase Plan, respectively. During 2023, the Company adopted the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ). The Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, SARs, restricted stock awards, RSU awards, performance awards, and other awards. to employees, directors, and consultants. of the fully diluted common stock determined at the Close of the Merger, determined to be . In addition, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that remain available to be awarded under the Plan, will automatically increase on January 1 of each year for a period of commencing on January 1, 2024 and ending on , in an amount equal to of the total number of shares of the fully diluted common stock determined as of the day prior to such increase. The aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options is approximately three times the total number of shares of common stock initially reserved for issuance, which were 71,522. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and stock options remain available to be awarded under the Plan, respectively. The Company accounts for stock-based payments pursuant to ASC 718 Stock Compensation and, accordingly, the Company records compensation expense for stock-based awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company has concluded that its historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. Therefore, the expected term was determined according to the simplified method, which is the average of the vesting tranche dates and the contractual term. Due to the lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, the estimate of expected volatility is primarily based on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, companies with comparable characteristics were selected, including enterprise value and position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the share-based awards. The Company computes the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies shares during the equivalent periods of the calculated expected term of its share-based awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining maturities similar to the expected term of the options. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

for the year ended December 31, 2024 as the Company incurred losses for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and is forecasting an estimated net loss for both financial statement and tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2024. Therefore, no federal or state income taxes are expected and none have been recorded at this time. Income taxes have been accounted for using the liability method in accordance with FASB ASC 740. Due to the Company's history of losses since inception, there is not enough evidence at this time to support that the Company will generate future income of a sufficient amount and nature to utilize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the deferred tax assets have been reduced by a full valuation allowance, since the Company cannot currently support that realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not. At September 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce the Company s effective tax rate if recognized.

 Overview 
 
 Banzai is a Marketing Technology (MarTech) company that produces data-driven marketing and sales solutions for businesses of all sizes. Our mission is to help our customers accomplish their mission - by enabling better marketing, sales, and customer engagement outcomes. Banzai endeavors to acquire companies strategically positioned to enhance our product and service offerings, increasing the value provided to current and prospective customers. 
 
 Banzai was founded in 2015. The first product Banzai launched was Reach, a SaaS and managed services offering designed to increase registration and attendance of marketing events, followed by the acquisition of Demio, a SaaS solution for webinars designed for marketing, sales, and customer success teams, in 2021 and the launch of Boost, a SaaS solution for social sharing designed to increase attendance for Demio-hosted events by enabling easy social sharing by event registrants, in 2023. Our customer base included over 3,900 customers as of September 30, 2024 and comes from a variety of industries, including (among others) healthcare, financial services, e-commerce, technology and media, in over 90 countries. Our customers range in size from solo entrepreneurs and small businesses to Fortune 500 companies. No single customer represents more than 10 of our revenue. Since 2021, we have focused on increasing mid-market and enterprise customers for Demio. Progress towards this is reflected in our increase in multi-host Demio customers from 14 on January 1, 2021 to 110 on September 30, 2024. 
 
 We sell our products using a recurring subscription license model typical in SaaS businesses. Pricing tiers for our main product, Demio, are based on the number of host-capable users, desired feature sets, and maximum audience size. Boost pricing tiers are based on the Demio plan to which the customer subscribes. Reach pricing is based on the number of event campaigns a customer has access to run simultaneously or the maximum number of registrations a customer is allowed to generate per subscription period. Banzai s customer contracts vary in term length from single months to multiple years.

If the Company meets these requirements, the Company may be granted an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance. However, if it appears to Nasdaq that the Company will be unable to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is not otherwise eligible for the additional cure period, Nasdaq will provide written notice to the Company that its securities are subject to delisting.

Net Revenue Retention NRR 
 
 NRR is a metric Banzai uses to measure the revenue retention of its existing customer base. NRR calculates the change in revenue from existing customers by cohort over a period of time, after taking into account revenue lost due to customer churn and downgrades, and revenue gained due to upgrades and reactivations. 
 
 The formula for calculating NRR is: NRR = (Revenue at the beginning of a period - Revenue lost from churn, and downgrades + Revenue gained from expansion and reactivation) / Revenue at the beginning of the period. 
 
 The following table presents average monthly NRR for Demio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Average Customer Value ACV 
 
 ACV is a metric Banzai uses to calculate the total revenue that it can expect to generate from a customer in a year. ACV is commonly used in the SaaS industry to measure the value of a customer to a subscription-based company over a 12-month period. 
 50 

Banzai uses ACV to segment its customers and to determine whether the value of new customers is growing or shrinking relative to the existing customer base. Banzai uses this information to make strategic decisions about pricing, marketing, and customer retention. 
 
 The formula for calculating ACV is: ACV = Total Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) / Total Number Customers, where ARR is defined as annual run-rate revenue of subscription agreements from all customers measured at a point in time. 
 
 The following table presents new customer ACV and total average ACV for Demio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Customer Acquisition Cost CAC 
 
 CAC is a financial metric Banzai uses to evaluate the average cost of acquiring a new customer. It includes marketing, sales, and other related expenses incurred while attracting and converting prospects into paying customers. CAC is a critical metric for Banzai to understand the efficiency and effectiveness of its marketing and sales efforts, as well as to ensure sustainable growth. 
 
 The formula for calculating CAC is: CAC = Total Sales Marketing Cost / Number of Customers Acquired.

Customer Churn 
 
 Customer Churn is the rate of customers who deactivate in a given period relative to the number of active customers at the beginning of such period or end of the prior period. Understanding drivers of churn allows Banzai to take measures to reduce the number of customers who deactivate and increase the overall rate of customer retention. There are two types of Churn measured: Revenue churn and Customer (or logo) churn. 
 
 The formula for calculating Churn is: Churn = [# or value of] Deactivations / [# or value of] Active Customers (Beginning of period). 
 
 The following table presents revenue Churn and new customer (or logo) Churn for Demio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Customer Lifetime Value LTV 
 
 LTV is a financial metric Banzai uses to estimate the total revenue it can expect to generate from a customer throughout their entire relationship. LTV helps Banzai understand the long-term value of each customer, enabling it to make informed decisions about 
 51 

marketing, sales, customer support, and product development strategies. It also helps Banzai allocate resources more efficiently by identifying high-value customer segments to focus on growth and retention. 
 
 The formula for calculating LTV is comprised of two metrics: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and Customer Life represented in # of months. Calculations for these metrics on a per-customer basis, as follows: 
 
 MRR = ACV / 12 
 Customer Life (# of months) = 1 / Churn 
 LTV = MRR Customer Life (# of months) 
 
 MRR is calculated by aggregating, for all customers from customer base or the group being measured during that month, monthly revenue from committed contractual amounts. For customers on annual contracts, this represents their ACV divided by 12. 
 
 The following table presents MRR, Customer Life, and LTV for Demio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

LTV / CAC Ratio 
 
 LTV / CAC ratio is a culminating metric measuring the efficiency of Sales and Marketing activities in terms of the dollar value of new business generated versus the amount invested in order to generate that new business. This provides a measurement of ROI for Sales and Marketing activities. A segmented view of LTV / CAC ratio gives additional insight into the profitability of various business development activities. 
 
 The formula for calculating LTV / CAC ratio is: LTV / CAC for the segment or activity being measured.

Analysis of the Impact of Key Business Drivers on Financial Performance 
 
 Banzai strives to maximize revenue growth within a reasonable cost structure through optimizing and continuous monitoring of the key business metrics described above relative to SaaS industry benchmarks, Banzai s direct competition, and historical company performance. This is accomplished through a combination of increased revenue per customer (higher ACVs and NRR) on an increasing customer base, generated through efficient customer acquisition (LTV / CAC ratio) and improved customer retention (lower churn, higher customer life). Other business activities contribute to improved performance and metrics, including but not limited to the following: 
 
 Customer Success and Onboarding, leading to maximum customer satisfaction and retention. 

Product Development and Support, maximizing customer value, supporting usage and expansion revenue. 

Company Initiatives, designed to improve trial experience and conversion rates, on-demand adoption, and emphasis on data to position our products as a system of automation and a system of record for our customers, supporting growth and retention. 

52 

Identification of Operational Risk Factors 
 
 There are a number of key internal and external operational risks to the successful execution of Banzai s strategy. 
 
 Internal risks include, among others: 
 
 Management and leadership issues: ineffective leadership, poor decision-making, or lack of direction. 

Operational inefficiencies: inadequate processes and poor resource allocation may lead to decreased productivity or insufficient ROI. 

Financial mismanagement: inadequate financial planning, improper accounting practices, or excessive debt can lead to financial instability. 

Employee-related challenges: high turnover, lack of skilled staff, or internal conflicts can impact morale and productivity. 

Technological obsolescence: failing to develop (or adapt) to new technologies in anticipation or response to changes in market trends can lead to competitive disadvantages. 

External risks include, among others: 
 
 Economic factors: including economic downturns, inflation, or currency fluctuations impacting business spending and overall market conditions. 

Competition: from established industry players to new entrants, eroding market share and profitability. 

Legal and regulatory: changes in laws or regulations that impact operations or increase compliance costs. 

Technological disruptions: from advancements in technology leading to obsolescence of existing products. 

Unforeseen events: including natural disasters, geo-political instability, and pandemics, potentially impacting market demand, operational or supply chain disruption. 

Analysis of the Impact of Operational Risks on Financial Performance 
 
 The risk factors described above could have significant impacts on Banzai s financial performance. These or other factors, including those risk factors summarized in the section titled Risk Factors could impact Banzai s ability to generate and grow revenue, contain costs, or inhibit profitability, cash flow, and overall financial performance: 
 
 Revenue and Sales: Internal risks from operating inefficiency or external factors, including economic downturns or increased competition, could lead to lower sales, impaired unit economics, and reduced revenue. 

Costs and Expenses: Internal operating mismanagement or external factors, including supplier issues, may cause increased cost relative to revenue generation, resulting in insufficient return on investment or profit margins. 

By continuing to conduct comprehensive risk monitoring and analysis on financial performance, Banzai can optimize its ability to make informed decisions and improve its ability to navigate internal and external challenges. Such activities include: identification and categorization of risks, quantification and analysis of potential severity, and development of risk mitigation strategies. It is also important for Banzai to ensure financial reports and disclosures accurately reflect the potential impact of risks on financial performance, essential for transparent communication with investors and stakeholders. 
 
 The Business Combination and Public Company Costs 
 
 The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, 7GC was treated as the acquired company for financial statement reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the financial statements of Banzai represent a continuation of the financial statements of Legacy Banzai with the Business Combination treated as the equivalent of Legacy Banzai issuing stock for the net assets of 7GC, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of 7GC were stated at 
 53 

historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of Legacy Banzai in this and future reports of Banzai. 
 
 Due to the Business Combination, we became the successor to an SEC-registered and Nasdaq-listed company, which required Banzai to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We incurred and expect to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting, legal and administrative resources, including increased audit and legal fees. We are qualified as an emerging growth company. As a result, we have been provided certain disclosure and regulatory relief. Our future results of operations and financial position may not be comparable to Legacy Banzai s historical results of operations and financial position as a result of the Business Combination.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Banzai reported total revenue of approximately 3,228 thousand, representing a decrease of approximately 251 thousand, or approximately 7.2 , compared to the nine months for the same period ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower Reach revenue which declined by approximately 44 thousand due to a shift in Banzai's focus to its Demio product and decision, which decision was reversed in the later part of Q1 2024, to begin phasing out the Reach product. In 2024 Banzai is revitalizing its focus on the Reach product through re-engineering and expanded sales efforts. Demio revenue was lower by approximately 203 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to churn and lower new sales period-over-period.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Banzai s cost of revenue totaled approximately 1,049 thousand and approximately 1,133 thousand, respectively. This represents a decrease of approximately 84 thousand, or approximately 7.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is due primarily to lower customer base that led to an approximately 12 higher average cost per customer, driven by the increase of the streaming services costs of approximately 150 thousand that were offset by lower infrastructure costs / data licenses of approximately 117 thousand, payroll and contracted services of approximately 98 thousand, and merchant fee costs of approximately 12 thousand.

Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were approximately 11.7 million and approximately 8.9 million, respectively, an increase of approximately 2.8 million, or 31.1 . This increase was due primarily to an overall increase in salaries and related expenses by approximately 0.2 million, marketing expenses by approximately 0.6 million, 
 55 

costs associated with audit, technical accounting, and legal and other professional services of approximately 1.6 million. On September 16, 2024, the Company committed to a reduction in force (the "Reduction") intended to decrease expenses and maintain a streamlined organization to support key programs and customers, and that is expected to conserve cash. As part of the Reduction, the Company reduced its headcount by 24 employees, which represented approximately 34 of the Company's full-time employees as of September 15, 2024. The cost-saving measures from the Reduction are expected to reduce annual operating expenses by approximately an additional 1.3 million beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company estimates that it will incur total restructuring charges of approximately 0.1 million, including severance payments in connection with the Reduction. The Company completed the reduction in October, 2024.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Banzai s reported provision for income tax expense was 7 thousand and 17 thousand, respectively. 
 
 Due to Banzai's history of losses since inception, there is not enough evidence at this time to support that Banzai will generate future income of a sufficient amount and nature to utilize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the deferred tax assets have been reduced by a full valuation allowance, since Banzai cannot currently support that realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Banzai had no unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce Banzai's effective tax rate if recognized.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Banzai reported net losses of approximately 23.7 million and approximately 8.0 million, respectively. The greater net loss is primarily due to an increase in total other expenses of approximately 12.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in addition to an increase in operating expenses of approximately 2.8 million and a decrease in gross profit of approximately 0.2 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different 
 57 

assumptions or conditions. On a recurring basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in an estimate, if any, will be reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in the estimate. 
 
 We believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 
 
 Recognition and measurement of convertible notes, including the associated embedded derivatives 
 The Company accounts for certain debt agreements at fair value in accordance with ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . These debt arrangements are subject to revaluation at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 The Company evaluates all its financial instruments to determine if such instruments contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives must be separately measured from the host contract if all the requirements for bifurcation are met. The assessment of the conditions surrounding the bifurcation of embedded derivatives depends on the nature of the host contract. Bifurcated embedded derivatives are recognized at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations each period. Bifurcated embedded derivatives are classified with the related host contract in the Company s balance sheet. 
 
 Recognition and measurement of bridge notes, carried at fair value 
 
 The Company determined the Agile Notes and 1800 diagonal Notes (The "Bridge Notes") were eligible for the fair value option, in accordance with ASC 825-10-50-28, and made such election to account for the Bridge Notes, respectively entirely at fair value. These debt arrangements are subject to revaluation at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure as defined below, is useful in evaluating our operational performance distinct and apart from certain irregular, non-cash, and non-operational expenses. We use this information for ongoing evaluation of operations and for internal planning purposes. We believe that non- GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with results under GAAP, may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance and comparing our performance with competitors and other comparable companies. 
 
 Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of Adjusted EBITDA, by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net loss, and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measure. Some of these limitations are: 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation. 

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or contractual commitments. 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment and restructuring costs. 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income. 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes. 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect audit, legal, incremental accounting and other expenses tied to M A or the Business Combination. 

Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should only be considered alongside results prepared in accordance with GAAP, including various cash-flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other GAAP results and financial performance measures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 Since inception, Banzai has financed its operations primarily from the sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes, and proceeds from senior secured loans. As of September 30, 2024, Banzai had cash of approximately 4.3 million. 
 
 Banzai has incurred losses since its inception, had a working capital deficit of approximately 25.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2024 totaling approximately 70.4 million. As of September 30, 2024, Banzai had approximately 1.4 million and approximately 9.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding on term/promissory notes and convertible notes, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Banzai raised additional capital under the SEPA through the issuance of additional convertible notes for a total of approximately 2.5 million to fund the Company's operations. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued non-cash share payments of approximately 3.9 million in partial settlement of the Yorkville Promissory Note financing, and made an approximately 0.5 million non-cash share payment to settle the deferred fee liability payable to Yorkville in terms of the SEPA. In May 2024 the Company entered into the Amended Repayment Agreement which extended the maturity date on the convertible notes to September 25, 2024, and pursuant to which the Company made a cash payment of 0.8 million in partial settlement of the Yorkville Promissory Notes. These stock issuances described herein do not represent sources of new capital, rather the issuances were made to settle existing liabilities in lieu of cash payments, as described above. Banzai has historically used debt financing proceeds principally to fund operations. On May 22, 2024 and September 24, 2024, Banzai entered into a securities purchase agreement with accredited investors, providing for the issuance and sale of Common Stock, Pre-Funded Warrants, and Common Warrants in a registered direct offering. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the May 2024 and September 2024 Offerings were approximately 2.5 million and 5.0 million, respectively. 
 
 Banzai s intends to seek additional funding through the SEPA arrangement and other equity financings in 2024. If Banzai is unable to raise such funding, Banzai will have to pursue an alternative course of action to seek additional capital through other debt and equity financing. 
 
 On September 16, 2024, the Company committed to a reduction in force (the "Reduction") intended to decrease expenses and maintain a streamlined organization to support key programs and customers, and that is expected to conserve cash. As part of the Reduction, the Company reduced its headcount by 24 employees, which represented approximately 34 of the Company's full-time employees as of September 15, 2024. The cost-saving measures from the Reduction are expected to reduce annual operating expenses by approximately an additional 1.3 million beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company estimates that it will incur total restructuring charges of approximately 0.1 million, including severance payments in connection with the Reduction. The Company completed the reduction in October, 2024. 
 
 If Banzai is unable to raise sufficient additional capital, through future debt or equity financings or through strategic and collaborative ventures with third parties, Banzai will not have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to fund its planned business for 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements. There can be no assurances that Banzai will be able to secure alternate forms of financing at terms that are acceptable to management. In that event, Banzai might be forced to limit many of its business plans and consider other means of creating value for its stockholders. Based on the factors described above, and after considering management s plans, there is substantial doubt about Banzai s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements were available to be issued. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming 
 61 

Banzai will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

On August 16, 2024 the Company issued a promissory note (the August 1800 Diagonal Note for an aggregate principal amount of 184,000 and received 160,000 of proceeds, net of an original issue discount of 24,000, with a maturity date of June 15, 2025. The August Securities Purchase Agreement stipulates that the Company and Lender may mutually agree to enter into additional tranches of promissory notes over the 12 month period commencing on August 16, 2024, up to an aggregate total of 750,000. The stated interest rate on the August Note is 12 per annum, and interest shall accrue on the August Note commencing on and including the issuance date pursuant to the August Agreement's monthly repayment and amortization schedule. 
 On September 24, 2024, the Company issued a second promissory note (the September 1800 Diagonal Note for an aggregate principal amount of 124,200 and received 108,000 of proceeds, net of an original discount of 16,200, with a maturity date of July 30, 2025. The stated interest rate on the September Note is 12 per annum, and interest shall accrue on the September Note commencing on and including the issuance date pursuant to the September Note Agreement's repayment and amortization schedule. 
 The August 1800 Diagonal Note and the September 1800 Diagonal Note are together referred to as the 1800 Diagonal Notes . 
 Upon an event of default, as defined in the agreements, all or any portion of the 1800 Diagonal Notes that are then-outstanding, may become convertible at the option of the Lender into fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company s Common Stock up to 4.99 of the Company s outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Notes become convertible at the lender s option upon an event of default, at a conversion price equal to the quotient resulting from dividing the Conversion Amount, measured as the sum of (1) the principal amount of the Note or Notes being converted in such conversion, plus (2) at the lender s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates to the respective note or notes being converted through the conversion date, plus (3) at the lender s option, the default interest, divided by the Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion (the conversion date). The Conversion Price will be measured as seventy-five percent (75 multiplied by the market price, which means the lowest trading price for the Company s Common Stock during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the conversion date. 
 The 1800 Diagonal Notes include optional conversion rights to the holder upon an event of default, contingent redemption (put) rights which trigger mandatory prepayment upon event of default, and defaulted contingent interest upon an event of default. 
 Due to these embedded features within the 1800 Diagonal Notes, the Company elected to account for the 1800 Agile Notes at fair value at their respective dates of issuance and in subsequent reporting periods, pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments ASC 825 ). The Company will record changes in the fair value of the notes that relate to changes in credit risk to other comprehensive income. The remaining changes in fair value, including the component related to accrued interest, will be recorded through the other (income) expense section of the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss statement in a single line item. 
 Interest expense on the 1800 Diagonal Notes totaled approximately 118,091 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is included in the fair value of the note. 
 
 Interest on Debt 
 
 Interest on debt totals 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing the aggregate interest expenses / payments obligation to be paid and to be recognized during the rest of the terms of the Loan Agreements and Notes, described above. 
 
 Operating Leases 
 
 Banzai has an operating lease for its real estate for office use. The lease term expires in October 2024. Banzai adopted ASC 842 Leases by applying the guidance at adoption date, January 1, 2022.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 Revenue 
 
 Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized throughout the life of the executed agreement. Banzai measures revenue based on considerations specified in terms and conditions agreed to by a customer. Furthermore, Banzai recognizes revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. The performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the service to the customer, which occurs over time. 
 
 Leases 
 
 Banzai s existing leases contain escalation clauses and renewal options. Banzai is not reasonably certain that renewal options will be exercised upon expiration of the initial terms of its existing leases. Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2022, Banzai accounted for operating lease transactions by recording lease expense on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. 
 
 Banzai entered into a sublease which it had identified as an operating lease prior to the adoption of ASC 842 Leases. Banzai remains the primary obligor to the head lease lessor, making rental payments directly to the lessor and separately billing the sublessee. The sublease is subordinated to the master lease, and the sublessee must comply with all applicable terms of the master lease. Banzai subleased the real estate to a third-party at a monthly rental payment amount that was less than the monthly cost that it pays on the headlease with the lessor. 
 
 Deferred underwriting fees 
 
 On December 28, 2023, the Company and Cantor amended the Fee Reduction Agreement to provide that the Reduced Deferred Fee was payable in the form of 22,279 shares of Class A Common Stock and to provide that Cantor is subject to a 12-month lock-up with respect to the Cantor Fee Shares. On December 28, 2023, the Company issued the Cantor Fee Shares to Cantor, covering the Reduced Deferred Fee in accordance with the Fee Reduction Agreement. The fair value of the 22,279 shares of Class A Common Stock was determined to be 2,450,639 on December 28, 2023 based on the Company's opening stock price of 110.00. Although the Company issued the Cantor Fee Shares, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has not satisfied its Cantor Registration Rights Obligations. As such, the Company cannot conclude that it has settled its outstanding obligations to Cantor. Therefore, neither criteria under ASC 405 for extinguishment and derecognition of the liability were satisfied and the 4,000,000 Reduced Deferred Fee remained outstanding as a current liability on the Company s September 30, 2024 balance sheet. 
 
 GEM commitment fee liability 
 In May 2022, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, GEM (the GEM Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the GEM Agreement, GEM is to purchase from the Company (or its successor following a Reverse Merger Transaction (as defined in the GEM Agreement)) up to the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock having an aggregate value of 100,000,000 (the GEM Financing ). Further, in terms of the GEM Agreement, on the Public Listing Date, the Company was required to make and execute a warrant ("GEM Warrant") granting GEM the right to purchase up to the number of common shares of the Company that would be equal to 3 of the total equity interests, calculated on a fully diluted basis, 
 66 

and at an exercise price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the public offering price or closing bid price on the date of public listing or (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing 650 million by the total number of equity interests. 
 
 On December 13, 2023, the Company and GEM entered into a binding term sheet (the GEM Term Sheet and, on December 14, 2023, a letter agreement (the GEM Letter ), agreeing to terminate in its entirety the GEM Agreement by and between the Company and GEM, other than with respect to the Company s obligation (as the post-combination company in the Merger) to issue the GEM Warrant granting the right to purchase Class A Common Stock in an amount equal to 3 of the total number of equity interests outstanding as of the Closing, calculated on a fully diluted basis, at an exercise price on the terms and conditions set forth therein, in exchange for issuance of a 2.0 million convertible debenture with a five-year maturity and 0 coupon. Due to the determination of the final terms of the planned 2.0 million convertible debenture having not been finalized, nor the final agreement related to the convertible debenture having been executed, as of September 30, 2024, the Company recognized, concurrent with the close of the merger, a liability for the GEM commitment fee, along with a corresponding GEM commitment fee expense, in the amount of 2.0 million. 
 On February 5, 2024, the Company and GEM entered into a settlement agreement (the GEM Settlement Agreement ), pursuant to which (a) the Company and GEM agreed to (i) settle the Company s obligations under and terminate the binding term sheet entered into between Legacy Banzai and GEM, dated December 13, 2023, and (ii) terminate the share repurchase agreement, dated May 27, 2022, by and among the Company and GEM, and (b) the Company (i) agreed to pay GEM 1.2 million in cash within three business days of the GEM Settlement Agreement and (ii) issued to GEM, on February 5, 2024, an unsecured promissory note in the amount of 1.0 million, payable in monthly installments of 100,000 beginning on March 1, 2024, with the final payment to be made on December 1, 2024 (the GEM Promissory Note ). 
 The GEM Promissory Note provides that, in the event the Company fails to make a required monthly payment when due, the Company shall issue to GEM a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the monthly payment amount divided by the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock for the trading day immediately preceding the applicable payment due date. In addition, the Company agreed to register on a registration statement 40,000 shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issuable under the terms of the GEM Promissory Note. The GEM Promissory Note contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs, GEM may, at its option, demand from the Company immediate payment of any outstanding balance under the GEM Promissory Note. As of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, we have issued an aggregate of 40,001 shares of Class A Common Stock to GEM in lieu of monthly payment obligations.

4.1. Conversion Right . After the occurrence of an Event of Default, at any time, the Holder shall have the right, to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid amount of this Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price determined as provided herein (a Conversion ); provided , however , that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso. The beneficial ownership limitations on conversion as set forth in the section may NOT be waived by the Holder . The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B(the Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 4.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the Conversion Date ); however, if the Notice of Conversion is sent after 6:00pm, New York, New York time the Conversion Date shall be the next business day. The term Conversion Amount means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date, plus (3) at the Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2) plus (4) at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 4.4 hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and in addition to the limitations set forth herein, if the Borrower has not obtained Stockholder Approval, the Borrower shall not issue a number of shares of Common Stock under this Agreement, which when aggregated with all other securities that are required to be aggregated for purposes of Rule 5635(d), would exceed 19.99 of the shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of definitive agreement with respect to the first of such aggregated transactions (the Conversion Limitation ). For purposes of this section, Stockholder Approval means such approval as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (or any successor entity) from the stockholders of the Company with respect to the issuance of the shares under this Agreement that, when taken together with any other securities that are required to be aggregated with the issuance of the shares issued under this Agreement for purposes of Rule 5635(d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Rule 5635(d) ), would exceed 19.99 of the issued and outstanding common stock as of the date of definitive agreement with respect to the first of such aggregated transactions. If the Borrower shall fail to maintain the listing of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market, the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE American Stock Exchange (collectively, the Exchanges ), the Conversion Limitation shall no longer apply to limit the issuance of shares in conversion of this Note. Principal Market means the Exchanges, the quotation platforms maintained by the OTC Markets Group) or an equivalent replacement exchange, and all rules and regulations relating to such exchange. 

The Holder shall be entitled to deduct 1,500.00 from the conversion amount in each Notice of Conversion to cover Holder's deposit fees associated with each Notice of Conversion. Any additional expenses incurred by Holder with respect to the Borrower's transfer agent, for the issuance of the Common Stock into which this Note is convertible into, shall immediately and automatically be added to the balance of the Note at such time as the expenses are incurred by Holder. 
 
 4.2. Conversion Price . The Conversion Price shall mean 75 multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount rate of 25 )(subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). Market Price means the lowest Trading Price (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the ten (10) Trading Day period ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date. Trading Price means, for any security as of any date, the closing bid price on the or applicable exchange or trading market (the Trading Market as reported by a reliable reporting service Reporting Service designated by the Holder (i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the Trading Market is not the principal trading market for such security, the closing bid price of such security on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such securityis listed or traded or, if no closingbid price of such securityis available in any of the foregoing manners, the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security that are listed in the pink sheets . If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes. Trading Day 

shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the Trading Market, or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded. 

4.3. Authorized Shares . The Borrower covenants that during the period that the Note is outstanding, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Borrower is required at all times to have authorized and reserved four times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price of the Note in effect from time to time initially 8,840,840 shares) (the Reserved Amount ). The Reserved Amount shall be increased (or decreased) from time to time (and in the case of each payment received by the Holder hereunder) in accordance with the Borrower s obligations hereunder. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding Note. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note. If, at any time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under this Note. 

4.4. Method of Conversion . 

4.4.1. Mechanics of Conversion . As set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, at any time following an Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, the balance due pursuant to this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to Section 4.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower (upon payment in full of any amounts owed hereunder). 

4.4.2. Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. 

4.4.3. Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 4.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days after such receipt subject to the terms hereof and applicable rules of the Principal Market (as defined hereinbelow) (the Deadline (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement. Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations hereunder, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. 

4.4.4. Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer FAST program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions set forth herein, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit and Withdrawal at 

Custodian DWAC system. 

4.4.5. Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting the Holder s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline due to willful and purposeful action and/or inaction of the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to the Holder 2,000 per day in cash, for each day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock (the Fail to Deliver Fee ); provided; however that the Fail to Deliver Fee shall not be due if the failure is a result of a third party (i.e., transfer agent; and not the result of any failure to pay such transfer agent) despite the best efforts of the Borrower to effect delivery of such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 4.4(e) are justified. 

4.5. Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless: (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration (such as Rule 144 or a successor rule) Rule 144 ); or (iii) such shares are transferred to an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 4.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). 

Any restrictive legend on certificates representing shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel from Holder s counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that (i) a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected; or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Act; or otherwise may be sold pursuant to an exemption from registration. In the event that the Company does not reasonably accept the opinion of counsel that properly conforms to applicable securities laws provided by the Holder with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration (such as Rule 144), it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to this Note.

Person shall mean any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.

The Borrower shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 4.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, ten (10) days prior written notice (but in any event at least five (5) days prior written 

notice) of the record date of the special meeting of stockholders to approve, or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Note.

5. Miscellaneous 

5.1. Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver .

4.1. Conversion Right . After the occurrence of an Event of Default, at any time, the Holder shall have the right, to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid amount of this Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price determined as provided herein (a Conversion ); provided , however , that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso. The beneficial ownership limitations on conversion as set forth in the section may NOT be waived by the Holder . The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B(the Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 4.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the Conversion Date ); however, if the Notice of Conversion is sent after 6:00pm, New York, New York time the Conversion Date shall be the next business day. The term Conversion Amount means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date, plus (3) at the Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2) plus (4) at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 4.4 hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and in addition to the limitations set forth herein, if the Borrower has not obtained Stockholder Approval, the Borrower shall not issue a number of shares of Common Stock under this Agreement, which when aggregated with all other securities that are required to be aggregated for purposes of Rule 5635(d), would exceed 19.99 of the shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of definitive agreement with respect to the first of such aggregated transactions (the Conversion Limitation ). For purposes of this section, Stockholder Approval means such approval as may be required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (or any successor entity) from the stockholders of the Company with respect to the issuance of the shares under this Agreement that, when taken together with any other securities that are required to be aggregated with the issuance of the shares issued under this Agreement for purposes of Rule 5635(d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Rule 5635(d) ), would exceed 19.99 of the issued and outstanding common stock as of the date of definitive agreement with respect to the first of such aggregated transactions. If the Borrower shall fail to maintain the listing of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market, the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE American Stock Exchange (collectively, the Exchanges ), the Conversion Limitation shall no longer apply to limit the issuance of shares in conversion of this Note. Principal Market means the Exchanges, the quotation platforms maintained by the OTC Markets Group) or an equivalent replacement exchange, and all rules and regulations relating to such exchange. 

The Holder shall be entitled to deduct 1,500.00 from the conversion amount in each Notice of Conversion to cover Holder's deposit fees associated with each Notice of Conversion. Any additional expenses incurred by Holder with respect to the Borrower's transfer agent, for the issuance of the Common Stock into which this Note is convertible into, shall immediately and automatically be added to the balance of the Note at such time as the expenses are incurred by Holder. 

4.2. Conversion Price . The Conversion Price shall mean 75 multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount rate of 25 )(subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). Market Price means the lowest Trading Price (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the ten (10) Trading Day period ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date. Trading Price means, for any security as of any date, the closing bid price on the or applicable exchange or trading market (the Trading Market as reported by a reliable reporting service Reporting Service designated by the Holder (i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the Trading Market is not the principal trading market for such security, the closing bid price of such security on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such securityis listed or traded or, if no closingbid price of such securityis available in any of the foregoing manners, the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security that are listed in the pink sheets . If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes. Trading Day shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the Trading Market, or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded. 

4.3. Authorized Shares . The Borrower covenants that during the period that the Note is outstanding, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Borrower is required at all times to have authorized and reserved four times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price of the Note in effect from time to time initially 230,801 shares) (the Reserved Amount ). The Reserved Amount shall be increased (or decreased) from time to time (and in the case of each payment received by the Holder hereunder) in accordance with the Borrower s obligations hereunder. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding Note. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note. If, at any time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under this Note. 

4.4. Method of Conversion . 

4.4.1. Mechanics of Conversion . As set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, at any time following an Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, the balance due pursuant to this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to Section 4.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower (upon payment in full of any amounts owed hereunder). 

4.4.2. Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. 

4.4.3. Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 4.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days after such receipt subject to the terms hereof and applicable rules of the Principal Market (as defined hereinbelow) (the Deadline (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement. Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations hereunder, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as 

provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. 

4.4.4. Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer FAST program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions set forth herein, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian DWAC system. 

4.4.5. Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting the Holder s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline due to willful and purposeful action and/or inaction of the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to the Holder 2,000 per day in cash, for each day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock (the Fail to Deliver Fee ); provided; however that the Fail to Deliver Fee shall not be due if the failure is a result of a third party (i.e., transfer agent; and not the result of any failure to pay such transfer agent) despite the best efforts of the Borrower to effect delivery of such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 4.4(e) are justified. 

4.5. Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless: (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration (such as Rule 144 or a successor rule) Rule 144 ); or (iii) such shares are transferred to an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 4.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). 

Any restrictive legend on certificates representing shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel from Holder s counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that (i) a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected; or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Act; or otherwise may be sold pursuant to an exemption from registration. In the event that the Company does not reasonably accept the opinion of counsel that properly conforms to applicable securities laws provided by the Holder with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration (such as Rule 144), it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to this Note. 
 
 4.6. Effect of Certain Events . 

4.6.1. Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50 of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Article III). Person shall mean any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization. 

4.6.2. Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc . If, at any time when this Note is issued and 

outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Note, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 4.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, ten (10) days prior written notice (but in any event at least five (5) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of stockholders to approve, or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Note. The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges.

5. Miscellaneous 

5.1. Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privileges.
