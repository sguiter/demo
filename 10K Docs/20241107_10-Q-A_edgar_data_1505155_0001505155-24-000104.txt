Explanatory Note 
 This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A (the Amendment amends the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, filed by Upland Software, Inc. (the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on May 2, 2024 (the Original Form 10-Q ). Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references herein to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, this Form 10-Q, this Quarterly Report and similar names refer to the Original Form 10-Q, as amended by this Amendment. 
 Subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-Q, Ernst Young LLP EY ), our external auditor, conducted a routine internal quality review and communicated a previously unidentified deficiency existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to a management review control over prospective financial information used in the Company s goodwill impairment assessment, and specifically, not sufficiently performing and documenting the reasonableness of significant assumptions used therein. Solely as a result of this deficiency, the Company concluded that it had a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which had not been remediated as of March 31, 2024. 
 The material weakness did not result in any misstatement of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 included in our Original Form 10-Q, and accordingly, we have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in our Original Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. Furthermore, we have determined that given the material weakness, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2024. 
 This Amendment is being filed to (i) amend Part I, Item 4 Controls and Procedures to address management's re-evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 Part II, Item 6 Exhibits also has been amended to include currently dated certifications from the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as required by sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The certifications are attached to this Amendment as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2. 
 This Amendment is limited in scope to the portions of this Amendment set forth above, and does not modify, amend, or update in any way the any other items or disclosures contained in the Original Form 10-Q, including the condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in the Original Form 10-Q. 
 Except as noted above, this Amendment has not been updated for other events or information subsequent to the date of the filing of the Original Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction with the Original Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC.

PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. At the time our Original Form 10-Q was filed, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024. Subsequent to the Original Form 10-Q filing, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, reevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such reevaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024, due to a material weakness in the design and operation of a management review control over prospective financial information used in the Company s goodwill impairment assessment, and specifically, not sufficiently performing and documenting the reasonableness of significant assumptions used therein, that had not been remediated as of March 31, 2024. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Notwithstanding this material weakness, our management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements as filed in the Original Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 Remediation Plan 
 Our management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the material weakness identified above, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has evaluated the material weakness described above and designed a remediation plan to enhance our internal control environment. To remediate the material weakness, we plan to enhance the design, including the precision, of management s review control over prospective financial information used in the Company s goodwill impairment assessment, and specifically, the evaluation of significant assumptions utilized in the development of that prospective financial information. In addition, we will retain incremental evidence of the execution of such procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the material weakness described above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(f) and 15d- 15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, the risk.
