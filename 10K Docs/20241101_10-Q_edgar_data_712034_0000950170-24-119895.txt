Credit Agreement The Company is party to a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), dated as of January 27, 2017, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents and various lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for a senior secured credit facility, which consists of a million (US million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility, an A million (US million based on January 27, 2017 exchange rates) term loan facility, a US million term loan facility, and a US million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"). From July 2018 to November 2022, the Company entered into six amendments (the "Amendments") to the Credit Agreement. The following are the key changes, among other things, to the Credit Agreement as a result of the Amendments: replace the minimum fixed coverage ratio of :1.00 with a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of :1.00;

As of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately to 1.00 versus our maximum covenant of to 1.00. On October 30, 2024, the Company entered into a seventh amendment to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity of the senior secured credit facility to .

million. The result of our assessment was that the fair value of the International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and we concluded that no impairment existed. Estimating the fair value of each reporting unit requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future. We utilized a combination of discounted cash flows and market approach. The financial projections used in the valuation models reflected management's assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, economic and market trends, cost structure, discount rate, and other expectations about the anticipated short-term and long-term operating results for each of our reporting units. We believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved, or if future events occur that adversely affect our enterprise value, we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

Balance at September 30, 2024 

The goodwill balance includes million and million of accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. Identifiable Intangible Assets We test indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually as of our measurement date of May 31st and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred. During the second quarter, we identified a triggering event for our indefinite-lived trade names within our Americas reporting unit indicating that it was more likely than not that an impairment loss had been incurred. The triggering event was a decline in forecasted cash flows within certain product categories. Accordingly, as of May 31, 2024, we completed an impairment assessment, on a quantitative basis, for our indefinite-lived trade names. The result of our assessment was that the fair value of the Five Star indefinite-lived trade name did not exceed its carrying value resulting in an impairment charge of million. The result of our assessment of the Swingline and ACCO indefinite-lived trade names was that the fair value of each exceeded its carrying value and we concluded that no impairment existed. Estimating the fair value of each trade name requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future. We utilized a relief-from-royalty discounted cash flows approach. The financial projections used in the valuation models reflected management's assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, economic and market trends, royalty rate, discount rate, and other expectations about the anticipated short-term and long-term operating results for each of our indefinite-lived trade names. We believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each our indefinite-lived trade names. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. As of June 1, 2024, we changed our Five Star and Swingline indefinite-lived trade names to amortizable intangible assets as they no longer met the indefinite-lived criteria. We began amortizing both trade names on a straight-line basis over a life of as of June 1, 2024.

million on income before taxes of million . For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of million on income before taxes of million . The million decrease in tax expense compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the decrease in income before taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of million on a loss before taxes of million . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of million on income before taxes of million . The million decrease in tax expense was primarily driven by the tax benefits related to the impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and the settlement of certain pension plans. In addition, there were changes to uncertain tax positions based on the statutes of limitations and Brazilian income tax refunded related to certain interest income generated. Income before taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower also driving a decrease in tax expense. The non-cash goodwill impairment charge of million had no associated tax benefit. The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the years 2020 and forward. Foreign and U.S. state jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from to years. Years still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Australia 2020 forward ), Brazil 2019 forward ), Canada 2020 forward ), Germany 2020 forward ), Sweden 2022 forward and the U.K. 2022 forward ). We are currently under examination in certain foreign and U.S. jurisdictions. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two) Legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to, or seek to enforce, novel interpretations of their tax rules. These changes may include modifications that can be temporary or permanent. For example, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (the "OECD"), the European Union and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECD's Pillar Two initiative introduces a global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis and for which many jurisdictions have now committed to an effective enactment date starting January 1, 2024. Management is currently assessing the impact and materiality of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations.

 million. In connection with the judicial challenge, we were required to provide security to guarantee payment of the Second Assessment should we not prevail. In the third quarter of 2020, the final administrative appeal of the First Assessment was decided against the Company, and we determined that we would challenge this decision. In 2022, we challenged this adverse decision in the tax authority's lawsuit at the judicial level seeking to collect the tax. In connection with the judicial challenge, we were required to provide security to guarantee payment of the First Assessment should we not prevail. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously contest both of the Brazil Tax Assessments; however, there can be no assurances that we will ultimately prevail. The ultimate outcome will not be determined until the Brazilian judicial process is complete. It is possible we could have a final decision regarding the Second Assessment at any time in the next twelve to eighteen months. If the FRD's initial position is ultimately sustained, payment of the amount assessed would materially and adversely affect our cash flow in the year of settlement. Because there is no settled legal precedent on which to base a definitive opinion as to whether we will ultimately prevail, we consider the outcome of these disputes to be uncertain. Since it is not more likely than not that we will prevail, in 2012, we recorded a reserve in the amount of million (at December 31, 2012 exchange rates) in consideration of this contingency, of which million was recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price, and which included the 2007-2012 tax years plus penalties and interest through December 2012. During the third quarter of 2023, there was a change in Brazilian law which allowed us to seek a cancellation of the percent standard penalty that would be payable in the event we do not prevail in our actions challenging the Brazil Tax Assessments. Following completion of the necessary administrative procedures, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reduced its reserve for this contingency by million, representing the amount of the cancelled penalties, as well as interest and other fees related to those penalties. We will continue to actively monitor administrative and judicial court decisions and evaluate their impact, if any, on our legal assessment of the ultimate outcome of our disputes. In addition, we will continue to accrue interest related to this contingency until such time as the outcome is known or until evidence is presented that we are more likely than not to prevail. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued additional interest as a charge to current income tax expense of million and million, respectively. At current exchange rates, our accrual as of September 30, 2024, including tax, penalties and interest is million (reported in "Other non-current liabilities").

 million and million , respectively. Under our stock repurchase program, during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and retired million shares, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we did t repurchase or retire any shares. For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we acquired million and million shares, respectively, related to tax withholding for share-based compensation. The calculation of basic earnings per share of common stock is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding in the year, or period, over which they were outstanding. Our calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock assumes that any shares of common stock outstanding were increased by shares that would be issued upon exercise of those stock awards for which the average market price for the period exceeds the exercise price less the shares that could have been purchased by the Company with the related proceeds, including compensation expense measured but not yet recognized.

Awards of potentially dilutive shares of common stock, which have exercise prices that were higher than the average market price during the period, are not included in the computation of dilutive earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the number of anti-dilutive shares was approximately million and million , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the number of anti-dilutive shares was approximately million and million , respectively.

Gains and losses on these derivative instruments are recognized within "Other (income) expense, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and are largely offset by the change in the current translated value of the hedged item. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions, with some relating to intercompany loans which extend beyond September 2025. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had foreign exchange contracts outstanding with a U.S. dollar equivalent notional value of million and million , respectively, which were not designated as hedges.

Liabilities: 

Forward currency contracts 

Our forward currency contracts are included in "Other current assets," "Other current liabilities," "Other non-current assets," or "Other non-current liabilities." The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are primarily valued based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by banks or foreign currency dealers. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within Level 2. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, notes payable to banks, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate carrying amounts due principally to their short maturities. The carrying amount of total debt was million and million and the estimated fair value of total debt was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair values are determined from quoted market prices, where available, and from using current interest rates based on credit ratings and the remaining terms of maturity. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements On a nonrecurring basis, we remeasure the fair value of the goodwill of our reporting units and our trade name indefinite-lived intangibles if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred. The fair value of our reporting units and trade names are considered Level 3 measurements. Level 3 measurements require significant unobservable inputs that are reflected in our assumptions. See "Note 8 . Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets" for more information.

Ind stria Gr fica Foroni Ltda. ("Foroni"), in years prior to its acquisition by ACCO Brazil, also filed a legal action in Brazil to recover these excess indirect tax payments and this legal action has been finalized. Upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, we are required under agreements with the former owners of the Foroni business to remit certain recovered tax credits, less the applicable tax and expenses, to the extent the tax credits relate to a tax period prior to the acquisition date.

 million. Other Pending Litigation We are party to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings, primarily related to alleged patent infringement, as well as other claims incidental to our business. In addition, we may be unaware of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology, brands, or products, and we may face other claims related to business operations. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products. It is the opinion of management that (other than the Brazil Tax Assessments) the ultimate resolution of currently outstanding matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, there is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these matters or that an adverse outcome in any matter will not affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. Further, future claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISC USSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Introduction 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of ACCO Brands Corporation and the accompanying notes contained therein. 
 Overview of the Company 
 
 ACCO Brands is a leading global consumer, technology and business branded products company, providing well-known brands and innovative product solutions used in schools, homes and at work. We have expanded into higher growth product categories, while increasing our sales mix to higher growth channels, including retail and mass merchants, e-tailers, and technology specialists. We have an experienced management team with a proven ability to grow brands, integrate acquisitions, manage seasonal businesses, run lean organizations and navigate challenging environments. Our products are sold primarily in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company reorganized its previously reported North America, EMEA and International operating segments into two operating segments, Americas and International. Americas includes the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Mexico and Chile and International includes EMEA, Australia, New Zealand and Asia. This change will simplify and delayer the Company's operating structure and reduce costs through headcount reductions, supply change optimization, global footprint rationalization, and better leverage of our sourcing capabilities. Prior period results have been reclassified to reflect this change in our operating segments. Each business segment designs, markets, sources, manufactures, and sells recognized consumer, technology and business branded products used in schools, homes and at work. Product designs are tailored to end-user preferences in each geographic region, and where possible, leverage common engineering, design, and sourcing. 
 
 Our product categories include gaming and computer accessories; storage and organization; notebooks; shredding; laminating and binding machines; stapling; punching; planners; dry erase boards; and do-it-yourself tools, among others. We distribute our products through a wide variety of channels to ensure that our products are readily and conveniently available for purchase by consumers and other end-users, wherever they prefer to shop. These channels include mass retailers, e-tailers, technology distributors, discount, drug/grocery and variety chains, warehouse clubs, hardware and specialty stores, independent office product dealers, office superstores, wholesalers, and contract stationers. We also sell directly through e-commerce sites and our direct sales organization. 
 Overview of Performance 
 The Company continues to be impacted by softer global demand, reflecting lower consumer and office spending due to the macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties. We expect these collective global trends to continue to impact our financial results. 
 During the third quarter, our net sales decreased 27.1 million, or 6.0 percent, compared to the prior year's third quarter. The decrease is due to lower back-to-school purchases by our customers in Latin America and North America. Additionally, global demand was weaker for certain office related products. These declines were partially offset by growth in the technology accessories categories. Gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions, partly offset by the impact of volume declines. 
 We reported operating income of 26.3 million in the third quarter, compared to 32.2 million in the prior year's third quarter. The decline in operating results was primarily due to lower sales volume and higher restructuring expense. 
 30 

Our operating cash flow for the first nine months was cash provided of 95.5 million compared to cash provided of 70.7 million in the prior year primarily reflecting reductions in working capital. Our operating cash flow continues to be seasonal with a historic pattern of strong inflows during the second half of the year.

Net Sales 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased 27.1 million, or 6.0 percent, including 4.4 million, or 1.0 percent, from adverse foreign exchange. Comparable net sales decreased 5.0 percent. The sales decline was driven by lower volume, which was down 4.7 percent, due to lower back-to-school sales in Latin America and North America. Additionally, global demand was weaker for certain office related products. These declines were partially offset by growth in the technology accessories categories. The exit of lower margin business in North America accounted for approximately 2.0 percent of the decline. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased 126.1 million, or 9.4 percent, including 7.4 million, or 0.6 percent, from adverse foreign exchange. Comparable net sales decreased 8.8 percent. The sales decline was driven by lower volume, which was down 8.5 percent, primarily due to softer global business and consumer demand for certain product categories, and from the exit of lower margin business in North America which accounted for approximately 3.0 percent of the decline. 
 Gross Profit 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased 7.9 million, or 5.5 percent, primarily due to volume declines partly offset by the impact of global cost reduction actions. Adverse foreign exchange reduced gross profit by 1.4 million, or 1.0 percent. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased 28.4 million, or 6.6 percent, primarily due to volume declines partly offset by the impact of global cost reduction actions and improved product mix. Adverse foreign exchange reduced gross profit by 2.0 million, or 0.5 percent.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") include advertising, marketing, selling (including commissions), research and development, customer service, depreciation related to assets outside the manufacturing and distribution processes, and all other general and administrative expenses outside the manufacturing and distribution functions (e.g., finance, human resources, information technology). 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, SG A decreased 6.6 million, or 6.7 percent, primarily due to the impact of global cost reduction actions and lower incentive compensation expense, partly offset by people cost inflation. Favorable foreign exchange reduced SG A by 0.7 million, or 0.7 percent. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A decreased 17.4 million, or 6.0 percent, primarily due to the impact of global cost reduction actions and lower incentive compensation expense, partly offset by people cost inflation. Favorable foreign exchange reduced SG A by 1.0 million, or 0.3 percent.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported operating income of 26.3 million, a decrease of 5.9 million, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volume and higher restructuring expense, partly offset by lower SG A expense. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported an operating loss of 79.0 million, a decrease of 176.5 million, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges of 165.2 million related to goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name within our Americas reporting unit. In addition, the impact of lower sales volume more than offset moderating product costs and lower SG A expense. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 4.5 million on income before taxes of 13.8 million. This compared with an income tax expense of 6.7 million on income before taxes of 21.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 3.3 million on a loss before taxes of 118.9 million. This compared with an income tax expense of 22.7 million on income before taxes of 60.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 See "Note 10. Income Taxes" for more information. 
 Net Income (Loss)/Diluted Income (Loss) per Share 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 9.3 million compared to net income of 14.9 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to lower operating income as noted above. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was 122.2 million compared to a net income of 37.6 million in the prior year. The net loss was primarily due to the non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased 25.3 million, or 8.9 percent, as a result of lower volume of 15.3 million, or 5.4 percent, and price decreases which reduced sales by 3.6 million, or 1.3 percent. The volume decline was primarily due to moderating demand trends in Latin America and lower replenishment for back-to-school products in North America. The exit of lower margin business in North America accounted for approximately 3.0 percent of the decline. These declines were partially offset by growth in technology accessories. Adverse foreign exchange reduced net sales 6.4 million, or 2.3 percent. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased 102.2 million, or 12.0 percent, as a result of lower volume of 84.0 million, or 9.9 percent, and price decreases which reduced sales by 12.7 million, or 1.5 percent. The volume decline was primarily due to softer business and consumer demand for our office products, and from the exit of lower margin business in North America, which accounted for approximately 4.0 percent. Adverse foreign exchange reduced net sales 5.5 million, or 0.6 percent. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported operating income of 25.9 million, a decrease of 7.9 million, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volume and 3.4 million of higher restructuring expense, partly offset by lower SG A expense as a result of our cost reduction initiatives and reduced incentive compensation. Adverse foreign exchange reduced operating income 0.6 million, or 1.8 percent. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported an operating loss of 76.7 million, a decrease of 183.2 million, primarily due to the non-cash impairment charges totaling 165.2 million related to goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name. The remaining change in operating results was from the impact of lower sales volume and 3.2 million of higher net restructuring expense, partly offset by moderating product costs and lower SG A expense as a result of our cost reduction initiatives and reduced incentive compensation. Adverse foreign exchange increased operating loss 0.2 million, or 0.2 percent.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased 1.8 million, or 1.1 percent, primarily due to lower volume of 5.6 million, or 3.4 percent, partly offset by price increases which added 1.8 million, or 1.1 percent. The lower volume reflects reduced business and consumer demand for our office products, partially offset by growth in technology accessories. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales 2.0 million, or 1.2 percent. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased 23.9 million, or 4.8 percent, primarily due to lower volume of 30.7 million, or 6.2 percent, partly offset by price increases which added 8.7 million, or 1.8 percent. The lower volume reflects reduced business and consumer demand for our office products, partially offset by growth in technology accessories. Adverse foreign exchange reduced net sales 1.9 million, or 0.4 percent. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating income increased 0.1 million primarily due to the cumulative benefit of cost reduction actions offsetting the impact of lower volume. Favorable foreign exchange increased operating income 0.2 million, or 2.1 percent. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating income increased 3.9 million primarily due to lower restructuring expense and the cumulative benefit of cost reduction actions offsetting the impact of lower volume. Adverse foreign exchange reduced operating income 0.5 million, or 1.9 percent. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary liquidity needs are to support our working capital requirements, service indebtedness and fund capital expenditures and dividends. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents held, and seasonal borrowings under our 600 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"). As of September 30, 2024, there was 22.5 million in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility 17.0 million reported in "Current portion of long-term debt" and 5.5 million reported in "Long-term debt, net"), and the amount available for borrowings was 569.0 million (allowing for 8.5 million of letters of credit outstanding on that date). We had 102.0 million in cash on hand. We maintain adequate financing arrangements at market rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 3.50 to 1.00 versus our maximum covenant of 4.00 to 1.00. We had no debt maturities before March 2026. 
 Our priorities for cash flow use, after funding business operations, include debt reduction, dividends, share repurchases and funding strategic acquisitions. 
 The 339.4 million of debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 under our senior secured credit facilities had a weighted average interest rate of 6.72 percent, and the 575.0 million outstanding principal amount of our senior unsecured notes due 2029 had a fixed interest rate of 4.25 percent. 
 On October 30, 2024, the Company entered into a seventh amendment to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity of the credit facility to October 30, 2029. The Company repaid in full the outstanding USD Senior Secured Term Loan A, the Australian Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A and part of the outstanding Euro Senior Secured Term Loan A by borrowing 
 34 

under the Revolving Facility. After giving effect to the seventh amendment, the current Revolving Facility provides for outstanding borrowings not to exceed 467.5 million. See "Note 3. Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings" for more information. 
 Adequacy of Liquidity Sources 
 We believe that cash flow from operations, our current cash balance and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings available under our Revolving Facility, will be adequate to support our requirements for working capital and restructuring expenditures, and to service indebtedness for the foreseeable future. 
 Restructuring Activities 
 From time to time the Company may implement restructuring, realignment or cost-reduction plans and activities, including those related to integrating acquired businesses. 
 For additional details, see "Note 9. Restructuring" to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in "Part I, Item 1. Financial Information" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Cash Flow for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents increased 35.6 million, as compared to an increase of 11.5 million in the first nine months of the prior year. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was driven by cash provided by trade working capital of 86.7 million, which includes accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. This was partially offset by cash payments for incentive compensation, interest and taxes. 
 Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by net income adjusted for non-cash add backs primarily consisting of amortization of intangibles, depreciation, and stock-based compensation expense. This was partially offset by cash payments for incentive compensation, interest and taxes. 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Cash used by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to capital expenditures. The prior year also included proceeds of 2.2 million from the sale of our facility in Japan. 
 35 

Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Cash used by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to cash outflows from a net decrease in debt, dividend payments, and cash used to repurchase common stock. 
 Cash used by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to cash outflows from a net decrease in debt and dividend payments. 
 Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), we provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including comparable sales. Comparable sales represent net sales excluding the impact of material acquisitions, if any, and with current-period foreign operation sales translated at prior-year currency rates. We sometimes refer to comparable sales as comparable net sales. 
 We use comparable sales both to explain our results to stockholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of our business. We believe comparable sales provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results and trends, facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and enhance an overall understanding of our past and future financial performance. Comparable sales should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP net sales and should be read in connection with the Company's financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP net sales as reported to non-GAAP comparable sales:

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 There are various claims, lawsuits and pending actions against us incidental to our operations, including the income tax assessments against our Brazilian subsidiary, ACCO Brands Brasil Ltda. (the "Brazil Tax Assessments"), which is more fully described in "Part I, Item 1. Note 10. Income Taxes, Brazil Tax Assessments" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 It is the opinion of management that (other than the Brazil Tax Assessments) the ultimate resolution of currently outstanding matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, there is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these matters or that an adverse outcome in any matter will not affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. Further, future claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
