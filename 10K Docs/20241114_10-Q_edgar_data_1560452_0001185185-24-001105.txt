. Mortgage loans are carried at current book value. A mortgage loan allowance has been established for any unforeseen losses using an industry approach, which establishes a reserve for possible loan losses charged to expense which represents, in the Company s judgement, the known and estimated credit losses existing in the loan portfolio. This reserve reduces the carrying value of investment in mortgage loans on the consolidated statement of financial position. The fair values for mortgage loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rate used to calculate fair values was indexed to the SOFR yield curve adjusted for an appropriate credit spread.

. As of December 31, 2023, the fixed maturity securities in a loss position had an average fair value to amortized cost ratio of . 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was and fixed maturity securities that were below investment grade as rated by taking the median of Fitch s, Moody s, and Standard and Poor s ratings, respectively. 

The Company monitors all fixed maturity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews. The Company evaluates whether a credit impairment exists for fixed maturity securities by considering primarily the following factors: (a) changes in the financial condition of the security's underlying collateral; (b) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments; (c) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer; and (d) the payment structure of the security. The Company's best estimate of expected future cash flows used to determine the credit loss amount is a quantitative and qualitative process. Quantitative review includes information received from third-party sources such as financial statements, pricing and rating changes, liquidity and other statistical information. Qualitative factors include judgments related to business strategies, economic impacts on the issuer, overall judgment related to estimates and industry factors as well as the Company's intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost. 

The Company's best estimate of future cash flows involves assumptions including, but not limited to, various performance indicators, such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, and current delinquency rates. These assumptions require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability of issuer default and estimates regarding timing and amount of expected recoveries, which may include estimating the underlying collateral value. In addition, projections of expected future fixed maturity security cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the issuer. Any credit losses are presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that no allowances for credit losses were necessary for the fixed maturity securities based on the current holdings, the respective economic factors, and the Company's historical experience. 

The unrealized depreciation shown herein are primarily the result of the current interest rate environment rather than credit factors.

Total fixed maturity securities 

Total fixed maturity securities 

Fair values for Level 2 assets for the Company s fixed maturity securities available-for-sale are primarily based on prices supplied by a third-party investment service. The third-party investment service provides quoted prices which use observable inputs in developing such rates. 

The Company analyzes market valuations received to verify reasonableness and to understand the key assumptions used and the sources. Since the fixed maturity securities owned by the Company do not trade on a daily basis, the third-party investment service prepares estimates of fair value measurements using relevant market data, benchmark curves, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. As the fair value estimates of the Company s fixed maturity securities are based on observable market information rather than market quotes, the estimates of fair value on these fixed maturity securities are included in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The Company s Level 2 investments include corporate bonds. 

The Company s fixed maturity securities available-for-sale portfolio is highly liquid and allows for substantially all of the portfolio to be priced through pricing services.

The estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment was required to interpret market data to develop these estimates. Accordingly, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts which could be realized in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the fair value amounts. 

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value disclosures for financial instruments in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto:

. The fair values for mortgage loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. For residential mortgage loans, the discount rate used was indexed to the SOFR yield curve adjusted for an appropriate credit spread. 

Other Long-Term Investments 

Other long-term investments are comprised of lottery prize receivables and fair value is derived by using a discounted cash flow approach. Projected cash flows are discounted using the average FTSE Pension Liability Index in effect at the end of each period. 

Policyholders Account Balances 

The fair value for liabilities under investment-type insurance contracts (accumulation annuities) is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach. Cash flows are projected using actuarial assumptions and discounted to the valuation date using risk-free rates adjusted for credit risk and the nonperformance risk of the liabilities.

Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

Texas Republic Capital Corporation we , us , our , TRCC or the Company was incorporated in May 2012 as a financial services holding company. We own and operate insurance subsidiaries: a life insurance company, a life insurance agency, and a property casualty insurance agency. We sell and issue life insurance products and annuity contracts as part of the insurance company. As an insurance provider, we collect premiums and annuity considerations in the current period to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders. Currently, we only issue our products in the state of Texas. As a life insurance agency and a property casualty insurance agency, we sell and place insurance products for other insurance carriers. If our life insurance company does not offer products that suit our client s needs, then we can meet their needs through other carrier products sold by our life agency. In addition, we have ability to cross-sell all current and prospective client s property and casualty insurance through the other agency, or the possibility of driving growth for the Company in other markets where participants are not seeking life insurance. The agencies collect commissions on the sale of those products. 

We also realize revenues from our investment portfolio, which is a key component of our operations. The revenues and funds we collect as premiums and annuity considerations from policyholders are invested to ensure future benefit payments under the policy contracts. Life insurance companies earn profits on the investment spread, which reflects the investment income earned on the premiums and annuity considerations paid to the insurer between the time of receipt and the time benefits are paid out under our policies and contracts. Changes in interest rates, changes in economic conditions and volatility in the capital markets can all impact the amount of earnings that we realize from our investment portfolio. 

The Company continues to incur overall losses since inception. These losses were fully expected, planned for, and fell within an expected range when considering the necessary start-up, infrastructure, distribution, and policy issuance costs of a new life insurance company. These losses have resulted from the costs incurred while raising capital and starting a new company, which involves investing in people, technology, infrastructure, marketing, brand awareness, distribution channels, regulatory and filing fees, legal costs, and other overhead expenses related to our operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until we achieve a volume of in-force life insurance policies that provide premiums and the associated investment income which are sufficient to cover our operating costs. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On a continuing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. 

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following accounting policies, judgments and estimates are the most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Investments 

Fixed maturity securities are comprised of bonds that are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale is generally adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. 

Interest income, as well as the related amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is included in net investment income under the effective yield method. 

The Company monitors all fixed maturity securities on an on-going basis relative to changes in credit ratings, market prices, earnings trends and financial performance, in addition to specific region or industry reviews. The Company evaluates whether a credit impairment exists for fixed maturity securities by considering primarily the following factors: (a) changes in the financial condition of the security's underlying collateral; (b) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments; (c) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer; and (d) the payment structure of the security. The Company's best estimate of expected future cash flows used to determine the credit loss amount is a quantitative and qualitative process. Quantitative review includes information received from third-party sources such as financial statements, pricing and rating changes, liquidity and other statistical information. Qualitative factors include judgments related to business strategies, economic impacts on the issuer, overall judgment related to estimates and industry factors as well as the Company's intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost. 

22

Table of Contents 

The Company's best estimate of future cash flows involves assumptions including, but not limited to, various performance indicators, such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, and current delinquency rates. These assumptions require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability of issuer default and estimates regarding timing and amount of expected recoveries, which may include estimating the underlying collateral value. In addition, projections of expected future fixed maturity security cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the issuer. Any credit losses are presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, with the change in allowance reported in net loss on the consolidated statements of operations. 

Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest earned on investments is recorded on the accrual basis and is included in net investment income. 

The Company s mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of residential properties with loan to appraised value ratios below 90 . Mortgage loans are carried at amortized book value. A mortgage loan allowance has been established for any unforeseen losses using an industry approach. While we utilize our best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of this allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio, the economy and changes in interest rates. Our allowance for possible mortgage loan losses consists of specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on specific loans and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred losses but not for specifically identified loans. The fair values for mortgage loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rate used to calculate fair values was indexed to the SOFR yield curve adjusted for an appropriate credit spread. 

Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Interest income on policy loans is recognized in net investment income at the contract interest rate when earned. 

The Company s other long-term investments are comprised of lottery prize cash flows holdings held at amortized cost. These investments are categorized as other long-term investments in the statement of financial position and are assignments of the future rights from lottery winners purchased at a discounted price. Payments on these investments are made by state run lotteries. Since state run lotteries are unlikely to default even in the most dire economic situations, no allowance for credit losses are necessary. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and money market instruments. 

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs 

Costs that relate to and vary with the successful production of new business are deferred over life of the policy. Deferred acquisition costs (DAC) consist of commissions and policy issuance, underwriting and agency expenses. DAC expenses are amortized primarily over the premium-paying period of life policies and as profits emerge on the annuity products, using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits. 

Deferred Sales Inducement Costs 

Sales inducement costs (SIC) are related to policy bonuses issued on some of the Company s annuity products. SIC is deferred at the issuance of the policy and amortized over the bonus period on a straight-line basis. The amount deferred is based on the difference between the fund value with the bonus and the fund value without the bonus. 

Policyholders Account Balances 

The Company s liability for policyholders account balances represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the financial statement date. This liability is generally equal to the accumulated account deposits plus applicable bonus and interest credited less policyholders withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance. Interest crediting rates for individual annuities range from 1.55 to 5.75 . 

23

Table of Contents 

Future Policy Benefits 

Future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields, mortality and withdrawals based upon the Company s experience. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves. Management s judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation. Actual experience may emerge differently from that originally estimated. Any such difference would be recognized in the current year s consolidated statement of operations. 

Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Please refer to the applicable paragraphs in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets DTAs and deferred tax liabilities DTLs for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine DTAs and DTLs on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on DTAs and DTLs is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

We recognize DTAs to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our DTAs in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the DTA valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 

We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 

Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

Revenues are primarily from life insurance premium income, investment income, and commission income. Realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from period to period.

Total revenues increased by 477,345 and 1,254,697 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily a result of increased new policy sales as we continue to successfully produce new business. Net investment income and commission income both remained similar compared to the prior year. The Company also accepted annuity considerations during 2024 and 2023. Annuity considerations contribute to additional net investment income through increased investments but are not classified as premiums and other considerations under total revenues for GAAP reporting.

Expenses 

Our expenses relate to operating a financial services holding company, a life insurance company, and two insurance agencies. 

Expenses were 2,025,662 and 5,500,078 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increases of 552,196 and 708,282 from 1,473,466 and 4,791,796 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Significant expense categories are discussed below. 

Total Benefits and Claims There was an increase of 98,777 and 77,658 in total benefits and claims for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Expenses were 490,848 and 1,639,945 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 392,071 and 1,562,287 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These increases were primarily due to an increase in death and other benefits and an increase in future policy benefits. Those two increases were offset by a decrease in interest credited to policyholders. The reason for the decrease in interest credited to policyholders is the Company has issued less annuities in the last couple of years. During that time, our focus has been more on issuing new life insurance business and based on new sales production, increased insurance volume, number of insureds covered, and the passage of time since policy issuance, this has resulted in an increase in future policy benefits. In addition, there was an increase in death and other benefits, which is to be expected based on those factors mentioned above. Death and benefit payments can significantly impact expenses from period to period due to timing. 

Commissions Commission expenses were 810,855 and 2,210,367 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 415,551 and 1,308,697 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These increases are consistent with the amounts of new business issued and renewal commissions paid on previously issued business, net of any applicable commission recaptured. The commission in the first year of policy issuance is typically significantly greater than the subsequent years. Conversely, in subsequent years with lower renewal commission rates, the Company should realize additional profits on previously issued business as premiums collected will significantly outweigh any renewal commissions paid. 

Salaries and Employee Benefits Salary and employee benefits expense increased 7,422 and decreased 29,913 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. For the nine months ended, the decrease is primarily related to a reduction in staff. The Company had a few employees leave the company since September 30, 2023. The Company decided to replace those employees with external consultants as opposed to hiring new employees for certain tasks and roles. This decision allows us to save on benefit costs, payroll taxes, other employee overhead expenses, and allows us to pay for their time as needed. This decision has helped to reduce the salaries and employee benefits expense. 

Other Expenses Third-party administration fees and professional fees continue to be two of the larger contributing expenses to the overall total expenses. The Company anticipates that these fees along with other general and administrative expenses will continue to increase over time due to new sales production, increased growth in the overall book of business, and the continued growth of the Company. The professional fees consist of public accounting firm fees, consulting actuarial fees, and the external consultants mentioned above in the salaries and employee benefits section. 

Net Loss 

The net loss was 700,056, or (0.04) per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 1,246,471 or (0.08) per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ending September 30, the net loss was 366,617 or (0.02) per share in 2024 compared to a net loss of 291,766 or (0.02) per share in 2023. The improvement of the net loss for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the increases and decreases in revenues and expenses described above. The slight decrease of the net loss for the three months ending September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the timing of death and other benefits mentioned above. 

The weighted average common shares outstanding and subscribed were 15,999,543 and 15,713,239 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted average common shares outstanding and subscribed were 16,061,114 and 15,798,375 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Financial Position As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 

Total assets of the Company decreased from 42,557,399 as of December 31, 2023 to 36,653,198 as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 5,904,201. Assets that increased or decreased materially in 2024 were invested assets, cash and cash equivalents, reinsurance recoverable, and deferred acquisition costs. 

Total investments decreased by 3,559,262, or 15.1 . This decrease was primarily due to maturities and payoffs. Those cash funds were primarily used to pay annuity surrenders on previously issued business along with other cash and cash equivalents which also decreased by 3,186,396. All non-operating cash is held in interest bearing cash equivalent accounts.

Table of Contents 

We continue to diversify the investment portfolio by our allocation strategy which should provide meaningful risk-adjusted increases to net investment income over the upcoming years and maximize total revenues. In addition, we continue to invest our excess cash in higher yielding investments as suitable options become available. 

The Company also recognized an increase in deferred policy acquisition costs and reinsurance recoverable as the Company continues to successfully sell more new business. Other assets that materially increased were federal income taxes recoverable on taxes withheld from cash receipts on other long-term investment payments which is included in the other assets line on the consolidated statements of financial position. The federal income taxes recoverable balance is 100 recoverable via tax refunds from the U.S. Government. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent the amounts due from our reinsurance partners. This balance continues to grow with the successful production of more and more business and our policy of using reinsurance partners to limit our exposure on any one individual policyholder. 

Policyholder liabilities include benefit reserves for both life and annuity policies, claim reserves, deposit funds and advance premiums. Policyholder liabilities decreased by 6,660,170 at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. That decrease is primarily due to a decrease in annuity policies as we focus more on life insurance production. 

Total shareholders equity of the Company increased from 9,995,531 as of December 31, 2023 to 10,694,760 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 699,229. The increase is mainly due to the additional capital raised during 2024 and change in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to interest rate movements in the market for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. That increase was primarily offset by the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since inception, our operations have been financed primarily through an organizational offering, four private placement offerings, an intrastate public stock offering, and a rights offering to existing shareholders only. Through September 30, 2024, we received 28,730,077 from the sale of 16,084,611 shares and incurred offering costs of 2,768,472. Since inception through December 31, 2018, the Company purchased 3,000 shares of the Company s common stock for 15,000 held as treasury stock. Additionally, TRLIC has purchased another 111,000 shares of TRCC common stock at a cost of 118,210 since 2018. The shares were purchased to compensate agents under TRLIC s Agent Stock Incentive Plan ASIP ). The Company has issued 16,080 treasury shares under the ASIP since inception of the plan and another 51,000 treasury shares as part of employment agreements and/or bonuses to employees. The remaining 43,920 shares held by TRLIC and the 3,000 shares held by TRCC total 46,920 shares. These shares are held as treasury shares in the consolidated financial statements. 

We had cash and cash equivalents totaling 8,692,767 as of September 30, 2024. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at multiple institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures interest and non-interest-bearing accounts up to 250,000. Uninsured balances aggregate 1,928,607 as of September 30, 2024. Other funds are invested in mutual funds that invest in U.S. government securities. We monitor the solvency of all financial institutions in which we have funds to minimize the exposure for loss. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. 

Capital provided from the previous offerings and current offering will provide a considerable amount of operating funds for current and future operations of TRCC. The operations of TRLIC should provide ample cash flows from premium income and investment income to meet operating requirements once a sufficient book of business has been established, or new policy sales are turned off, whichever happens first. Life insurance contract liabilities are generally long term in nature and are generally paid from future cash flows. The operations of TRLS and AIS should provide sufficient cash flows from commission income to meet their operating requirements. TRLS and AIS are also less capital intensive than TRLIC since it does not retain any of the policy risks or capital requirements. 

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate upon assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We are not aware of any commitments or unusual events that could materially affect our capital resources. We are not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authority which, if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
