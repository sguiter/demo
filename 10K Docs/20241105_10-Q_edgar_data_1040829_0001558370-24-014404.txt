The Company previously entered into an interest rate swap to fix the SOFR portion of the interest rate at for the fifth year of the loan. The Company designated this interest rate swap as an effective cash flow hedge. On March 28, 2024, the Company paid off the Gaylord Rockies Loan with proceeds from the Billion Senior Notes discussed above and terminated the interest rate swap. Term Loan B Prior to the effectiveness of the Incremental Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings under the Term Loan B were, at our option, either (i) Term SOFR plus , (ii) Daily Simple SOFR plus or (iii) a base rate as set forth in the Credit Agreement plus . On April 12, 2024, the Company entered into an Incremental Tranche B Term Loan Agreement (the Incremental Agreement ), which supplements the Company s credit agreement and includes the addition of certain new lenders and the removal of certain other lenders.

The applicable interest rate margins for the refinanced Term Loan B under the Incremental Agreement are (i) for SOFR Loans (as defined in the Company s credit agreement) and (ii) for base rate loans. The Incremental Agreement did not change the maturity dates under the Company s credit agreement or result in any increase in principal indebtedness.

The OEG Term Loan refinances and replaces the former term loan in the outstanding principal amount of million as of June 28, 2024 and the OEG Revolver refinances and replaces the senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million. At September 30, 2024, million was outstanding under the OEG Revolver. The OEG Term Loan and the OEG Revolver are each secured by substantially all of the assets of OEG Finance and each of its subsidiaries (other than Block 21-related subsidiaries, as more specifically described in the Amended OEG Credit Agreement). The OEG Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to either, at OEG Borrower s election, as of the closing contemplated by the Amended OEG Credit Agreement: (a) the Alternate Base Rate plus or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR plus (all as more specifically described in the Amended OEG Credit Agreement).

OEG Borrower used the proceeds of the OEG Term Loan, net of transaction expenses, to refinance the original term loan under the Original OEG Credit Agreement. Interest Rate Derivatives The Company has entered into or previously entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with the previous Gaylord Rockies million term loan and a portion of the million OEG term loan. Each swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge whereby the Company receives variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement without exchange of the underlying principal amount. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not hold any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. For derivatives designated as and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified to interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. These amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related variable-rate debt. The Company estimates that million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense in the next twelve months. In March 2024, as discussed above, the Company paid off the Gaylord Rockies Loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap. The Company received approximately million from the counterparty to the swap, which has been recorded as a reduction in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Overview We operate as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, specializing in group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets. Our core holdings include a network of five upscale, meetings-focused resorts totaling 9,917 rooms that are managed by Marriott under the Gaylord Hotels brand. These five resorts, which we refer to as our Gaylord Hotels properties, consist of the Gaylord Opryland Resort Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee Gaylord Opryland ), the Gaylord Palms Resort Convention Center near Orlando, Florida Gaylord Palms ), the Gaylord Texan Resort Convention Center near Dallas, Texas Gaylord Texan ), the Gaylord National Resort Convention Center near Washington D.C. Gaylord National ), and the Gaylord Rockies Resort Convention Center near Denver, Colorado Gaylord Rockies ). Our other owned hotel assets managed by Marriott include the Inn at Opryland, an overflow hotel adjacent to Gaylord Opryland, the AC Hotel at National Harbor, Washington D.C. AC Hotel ), an overflow hotel adjacent to Gaylord National, and effective June 30, 2023, the JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort Spa JW Marriott Hill Country ). Each of our award-winning Gaylord Hotels properties incorporates not only high quality lodging, but also at least 400,000 square feet of meeting, convention and exhibition space, superb food and beverage options and retail and spa facilities within a single self-contained property. As a result, our Gaylord Hotels properties provide a convenient and entertaining environment for convention guests. Our Gaylord Hotels properties focus on the large group meetings market in the United States. We also own a controlling 70 equity interest in a business comprised of a number of entertainment and media assets, known as the Opry Entertainment Group OEG ), which we report as our Entertainment segment. These assets include the Grand Ole Opry, the legendary weekly showcase of country music s finest performers for 99 years; the Ryman Auditorium, the storied live music venue and former home of the Grand Ole Opry located in downtown Nashville; WSM-AM, the Opry s radio home; Ole Red, a brand of Blake Shelton-themed bar, music venue and event spaces; Category 10, a Luke Combs-themed bar, music venue and event space that opened in November 2024; and Block 21, a mixed-use entertainment, lodging, office, and retail complex located in Austin, Texas Block 21 ).

The dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors (as otherwise permitted by our credit agreement) and certain provisions of our agreements governing our other indebtedness may prohibit us from paying dividends in accordance with any policy we may adopt. Our Long-Term Strategic Plan Our goal is to be the nation s premier hospitality REIT for group-oriented meeting hotel assets in urban and resort markets. Existing Hotel Property Design . Our Gaylord Hotels properties focus on the large group meetings market in the United States and incorporate meeting and exhibition space, signature guest rooms, food and beverage offerings, fitness and spa facilities and other attractions within a large hotel property so attendees needs are met in one location. We believe this strategy creates a better experience for both meeting planners and guests and has led to our current Gaylord Hotels properties claiming a place among the leading convention hotels in the country. Expansion of Hotel Asset Portfolio . Part of our long-term growth strategy includes acquisitions or developments of other hotels, particularly in the group meetings sector of the hospitality industry, either alone or through joint ventures or alliances with one or more third parties. We will consider attractive investment opportunities which meet our acquisition parameters, specifically, group-oriented large hotels and overflow hotels with existing or potential leisure appeal. We are generally interested in highly accessible upper-upscale or luxury assets with over 400 hotel rooms in urban and resort group destination markets. We also consider assets that possess significant meeting space or present a repositioning opportunity and/or would significantly benefit from capital investment in additional rooms or meeting space. We are consistently considering acquisitions that would expand the geographic diversity of our existing asset portfolio. To this end, we purchased JW Marriott Hill Country in June 2023. Continued Investment in Our Existing Properties . We continuously evaluate and invest in our current portfolio and consider enhancements or expansions as part of our long-term strategic plan. In 2022, we completed a re-concepting of the food and beverage options at Gaylord National and began a 98 million multi-year interior and exterior enhancement project at Gaylord Rockies to better position the property for our group customers. In early 2024, we identified over 1 billion in capital investment opportunities across our entire hotel portfolio, comprised of projects that we anticipate completing in phases through 2027.

 Leverage Brand Name Awareness . We believe the Grand Ole Opry is one of the most recognized entertainment brands in the United States. We promote the Grand Ole Opry name through various media, including our WSM-AM radio station, the Internet and television, and through performances by the Grand Ole Opry s members, many of whom are renowned country music artists. As such, we have alliances in place with multiple distribution partners in an effort to foster brand extension. We believe that licensing our brand for products may provide an opportunity to increase revenues and cash flow with relatively little capital investment. We are continuously exploring additional products, such as television specials and retail products, through which we can capitalize on our brand affinity and awareness. To this end, we have invested in six Ole Red locations, purchased Block 21, and in April 2023 announced a partnership with Luke Combs for Category 10, an entertainment venue concept that opened in November 2024. Further, in 2022, we completed a strategic transaction to sell a minority interest in OEG to an affiliate of Atairos Group, Inc. and its strategic partner NBCUniversal Media, LLC, who we believe will be able to help us expand the distribution of our OEG brands. Short-Term Capital Allocation . Our short-term capital allocation strategy is focused on returning capital to stockholders through the payment of dividends, in addition to investing in our assets and operations. Our dividend policy provides that we will make minimum dividends of 100 of REIT taxable income annually, subject to the board of directors future determinations as to the amount of any distributions and the timing thereof. Our Operations Our operations are organized into three principal business segments: Hospitality, consisting of our Gaylord Hotels properties, JW Marriott Hill Country (effective June 30, 2023), the Inn at Opryland and the AC Hotel. Entertainment, consisting of the Grand Ole Opry, the Ryman Auditorium, WSM-AM, Ole Red, Category 10, Block 21, and our other Nashville-based attractions. Corporate and Other, consisting of our corporate expenses. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our total revenues were divided among these business segments as follows: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, Segment 2024 2023 2024 2023 Hospitality 85 84 86 84 Entertainment 15 16 14 16 Corporate and Other 0 0 0 0

 Key Performance Indicators The operating results of our Hospitality segment are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our hotels and the quality of the customer mix at our hotels, which are managed by Marriott. These factors impact the price that Marriott can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities, such as food and beverage and meeting space. The following key performance indicators are commonly used in the hospitality industry and are used by management to evaluate hotel performance and allocate capital expenditures: hotel occupancy a volume indicator calculated by dividing total rooms sold by total rooms available; average daily rate ADR a price indicator calculated by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms sold; revenue per available room RevPAR a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing room revenue by room nights available to guests for the period; total revenue per available room Total RevPAR a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of room, food and beverage and other ancillary service revenue by room nights available to guests for the period; and net definite group room nights booked a volume indicator which represents the total number of definite group bookings for future room nights at our hotels confirmed during the applicable period, net of cancellations. 
 We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are measures of our historical performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures include: Earnings Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate EBITDA re ), Adjusted EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re , Excluding Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Joint Venture, and Funds From Operations FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders and Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders. 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for further discussion. The results of operations of our Hospitality segment are affected by the number and type of group meetings and conventions scheduled to attend our hotels in a given period. A variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period, including the nature and quality of the group meetings and conventions attending our hotels during such period, which meetings and conventions (and applicable room rates) have often been contracted for several years in advance, seasonality, the level of attrition our hotels experience, and the level of transient business at our hotels during such period. Increases in costs, including labor costs, costs of food and other supplies, and energy costs can negatively affect our results, particularly during an inflationary economic environment. We rely on Marriott, as the manager of our hotels, to manage these factors and to offset any identified shortfalls in occupancy.

The increase in our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, is attributable to increases in our Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment of 159.3 million and 7.2 million, respectively, as presented in the tables below. Total Operating Expenses The increase in our total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, is primarily the result of increases in our Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment of 10.8 million and 5.4 million, respectively, as presented in the tables below. The increase in our total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, is primarily the result of increases in our Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment of 93.7 million and 9.1 million, respectively, and an increase in depreciation expense of 20.1 million, as presented in the tables below. Net Income Our 19.6 million increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to the changes in our revenues and operating expenses reflected above, and each of the following factors, each as described more fully below. A 12.6 million decrease in loss from unconsolidated joint ventures in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period.

 A 6.3 million increase in provision for income taxes for the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period. 
 Factors and Trends Contributing to Performance and Current Environment Important factors and trends contributing to our performance during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, were: An increase in same-store (Hospitality segment excluding JW Marriott Hill Country) ADR of 6.2 in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period, reflective of our continued pricing strategy. A same-store increase of 5.6 in outside-the-room spending at our hotels in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period, primarily as a result of increased banquet and technology spending by groups. A same-store decrease in transient room nights traveled in the 2024 period of 10.2 , as compared to the 2023 period, as the Nashville and Orlando markets continue to experience softness in transient demand. In addition, the ongoing rooms renovation at Gaylord Palms also impacted demand in the 2024 period. An increase in Entertainment revenue in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period, related to Ole Red Las Vegas, which opened in January 2024, partially offset by a decrease related to the closure of the Wildhorse Saloon as it was being rebranded as Category 10 and a decrease at the W Austin primarily as a result of the disruption caused by the ongoing construction of enhancements at the property. 
 Important factors and trends contributing to our performance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were: The addition of JW Marriott Hill Country resulted in an increase of 116.3 million in revenues; the property averaged 232.14 in RevPAR and 608.50 in Total RevPAR. An increase in same-store ADR of 4.3 in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period, reflective of our continued pricing strategy. A same-store increase of 5.0 in outside-the-room spending at our hotels in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period, primarily as a result of increased banquet and technology spending by groups. Same-store in-the-year-for-the-year cancelled room nights at our hotels decreased 42.1 in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period. A same-store decrease in transient room nights traveled in the 2024 period of 11.5 , as compared to the 2023 period, as the Nashville and Orlando markets continue to experience softness in transient demand. In addition, the ongoing rooms renovation at Gaylord Palms also impacted demand in the 2024 period. An increase in Entertainment revenue in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period, related to Ole Red Las Vegas, which opened in January 2024, partially offset by a decrease related to the closure of the Wildhorse Saloon as it was being rebranded as Category 10 and a decrease at the W Austin primarily as a result of the disruption caused by the ongoing construction of enhancements at the property. 
 Other important factors and trends for the three and nine months ended, and as of, September 30, 2024 include: A same-store decrease of 16.3 and 3.3 , respectively, in net definite group room nights booked at our hotels in the 2024 periods, as compared to the 2023 periods, primarily as a result of timing as bookings for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased 32.5 over the same period in 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2023 was the highest booking quarter on record. On a same-store basis, group room nights on the books for all future years at our hotels at September 30, 2024 are 4.2 higher than the number on the books at the same point in 2023. In addition, the estimated ADR on those group room nights on the books at September 30, 2024 is 6.0 higher than the same point in 2023.

 Total operating expenses for the nine-month 2024 period were reduced by a 9.1 million refund of Tennessee franchise tax for prior years caused by a change in tax law, comprised of 5.6 million, 3.4 million and 0.1 million in our Hospitality segment, Entertainment segment and Corporate and Other segment, respectively. 
 Our strong revenues in recent periods have partially mitigated increasing costs in the current inflationary environment, which include increased interest rates, which drove higher interest expense on our debt, as well as increased insurance, utilities and other costs. The current inflationary environment is expected to continue in at least the near future.

See discussion of this item below. 
 Revenues increased in our Entertainment segment in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year periods, as incremental revenue from Ole Red Las Vegas, which opened in January 2024, was partially offset by the Wildhorse Saloon being temporarily closed as it was being rebranded as Category 10 and a decrease at the W Austin primarily as a result of the disruption caused by the ongoing construction of enhancements at the property . Entertainment segment operating expenses increased in the 2024 periods, as compared to the 2023 periods, primarily due

 to the opening of Ole Red Las Vegas, partially offset by the temporary closure of the Wildhorse Saloon. The nine-month 2024 period also includes a refund of Tennessee franchise tax for prior years caused by a change in tax law. Depreciation and amortization increased in the 2024 periods, as compared to the 2023 periods, primarily due to the depreciable assets associated with the opening of Ole Red Las Vegas.

Our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings, excluding capitalized interest, but including the impact of interest rate swaps, was 6.5 and 6.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6.8 and 6.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest Income Interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily includes amounts earned on our cash balances, as well as the bonds that were received in connection with the development of Gaylord National, which we hold as notes receivable. See Note 6, Notes Receivable, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for additional discussion of interest income on these bonds. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt As a result of the June 2024 refinancing of the OEG credit agreement, the April 2024 repricing of the RHP term loan B, and the March 2024 repayment of the Gaylord Rockies 800 million term loan (see Principal Debt Agreements below), we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result of the May 2023 refinancing of our credit facility and the extension of the Gaylord Rockies 800 million term loan, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The loss from unconsolidated joint ventures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 represents our equity method share of losses associated with our previous investment in Circle, a joint venture that we and our joint venture partner agreed to wind down at the end of 2023.

 Provision for Income Taxes As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal corporate income taxes on ordinary taxable income and capital gains income from real estate investments that we distribute to our stockholders. We are required to pay federal and state corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRSs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of 0.9 million and 2.2 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of 13.7 million and 7.3 million, respectively, related to our TRSs. The change in the income tax provision for the 2024 periods, as compared to the 2023 periods, relates to both changes in income at our TRSs in the 2024 periods and the effect of changes in valuation allowance in the 2023 periods. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We present the following non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance: EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre, Excluding Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Joint Venture Definition We calculate EBITDA re, which is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT in its September 2017 white paper as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change in control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in the value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity s share of EBITDA re of unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA re is then calculated as EBITDA re, plus to the extent the following adjustments occurred during the periods presented: Preopening costs; Non-cash lease expense; Equity-based compensation expense; Impairment charges that do not meet the NAREIT definition above; Credit losses on held-to-maturity securities; Transaction costs of acquisitions; Interest income on bonds; Loss on extinguishment of debt; Pension settlement charges; Pro rata Adjusted EBITDA re from unconsolidated joint ventures; and Any other adjustments we have identified herein. We then exclude the pro rata share of Adjusted EBITDA re related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures to calculate Adjusted EBITDA re , Excluding Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Joint Venture. We use EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re , Excluding Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Joint Venture to evaluate our operating performance. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance and debt leverage metrics, and that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance. We make additional adjustments to EBITDA re when evaluating our performance because we believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re , Excluding Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Joint Venture provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance and debt leverage metrics.

 FFO, Adjusted FFO, and Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders Definition We calculate FFO , which definition is clarified by NAREIT in its December 2018 white paper as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts), gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from a change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciated real estate held by the entity, income (loss) from consolidated joint ventures attributable to noncontrolling interest, and pro rata adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. To calculate Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders, we then exclude, to the extent the following adjustments occurred during the periods presented: Right-of-use asset amortization; Impairment charges that do not meet the NAREIT definition above; Write-offs of deferred financing costs; Amortization of debt discounts or premiums and amortization of deferred financing costs; Loss on extinguishment of debt; Non-cash lease expense; Credit loss on held-to-maturity securities; Pension settlement charges; Additional pro rata adjustments from unconsolidated joint ventures; (Gains) losses on other assets; Transaction costs of acquisitions; Deferred income tax expense (benefit); and Any other adjustments we have identified herein. FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders and Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders exclude the ownership portion of the joint ventures not controlled or owned by the Company. We believe that the presentation of FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders and Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders provides useful information to investors regarding the performance of our ongoing operations because they are a measure of our operations without regard to specified non-cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of assets and certain other items, which we believe are not indicative of the performance of our underlying hotel properties. We believe that these items are more representative of our asset base than our ongoing operations. We also use these non-GAAP financial measures as measures in determining our results after considering the impact of our capital structure. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA re , Excluding Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Joint Venture, FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders, and Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. These non-GAAP financial measures, and any related per share measures, should not be considered as alternative measures of our Net Income, operating performance, cash flow or liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures can enhance an investor s understanding of our results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed individually, are not necessarily better indicators of any trend as compared to GAAP measures such as Net Income (Loss), Operating Income (Loss), or cash flow from operations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities . Cash flow from operating activities is the principal source of cash used to fund our operating expenses, interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash flows provided by operating activities were 409.9 million, primarily reflecting our net income before depreciation expense, amortization expense and other non-cash charges of 411.9 million, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of 2.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash flows provided by operating activities were 369.9 million, primarily reflecting our net income before depreciation expense, amortization expense and other non-cash charges of 368.5 million and favorable changes in working capital of 1.4 million. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary uses of funds for investing activities were purchases of property and equipment, which totaled 317.3 million, and consisted primarily of enhancements at Gaylord Rockies to construct a new events pavilion, enhance the grand lodge and reposition its food and beverage outlets; the conversion of the Wildhorse Saloon to Category 10; a rooms renovation at the W Austin and common area enhancements at Block 21; the completion of Ole Red Las Vegas; enhancements to meeting spaces at Gaylord Opryland; a rooms and lobby renovation at Gaylord Palms; and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for each of our existing properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our primary use of funds for investing activities were the use of 791.5 million to purchase JW Marriott Hill Country and purchases of property and equipment, which totaled 122.2 million. Purchases of property and equipment consisted primarily of enhancements at Gaylord Rockies to better position the property for our group customers, the construction of Ole Red Las Vegas, a rooms, restaurant and meeting space renovation at Gaylord Palms, enhancements to the offerings at Block 21, and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for each of our existing properties. Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities . Our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the incurrence and repayment of long-term debt and the payment of cash dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash flows used in financing activities were 226.0 million, primarily reflecting the issuance of 1 billion in 6.50 senior notes, offset by the prepayment of the Gaylord Rockies 800.0 million term loan, the net repayment of 202.7 million under our term loan B, the payment of 199.8 million in cash dividends and the payment of 23.1 million in deferred financing costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash flows provided by financing activities were 769.9 million, primarily reflecting the issuance of the 400 Million 7.25 Senior Notes (as defined below), 395.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock, and the net borrowing of 122.5 million under our credit facility, partially offset by the payment of 115.9 million in cash dividends, and the payment of 23.4 million in deferred financing costs. Liquidity At September 30, 2024, we had 534.9 million in unrestricted cash and 759.7 million available for borrowing in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility and the OEG revolving credit facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 1 billion in 6.50 senior notes, repaid the 800.0 million Gaylord Rockies term loan, repaid 202.7 million under our term loan B, incurred capital expenditures of 317.3 million and paid 199.8 million in cash dividends. These changes, partially offset by the cash flows provided by operations discussed above, were the primary factors in the decrease in our cash balance from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. We anticipate investing in our operations during the remainder of 2024 by spending between approximately 80 million and 130 million in capital expenditures, which includes projects at Gaylord Rockies to enhance the grand lodge and reposition its food and beverage outlets; enhancements to meeting spaces at Gaylord Opryland to further appeal to our target group customers; a rooms renovation at the W Austin and common area enhancements at Block 21; a rooms renovation at Gaylord Palms; and ongoing maintenance capital for each of our current facilities . Further, our dividend policy provides that we will make minimum dividends of 100 of REIT taxable income annually. Future dividends are

 subject to our board of directors future determinations as to amount and timing. We currently have no debt maturities until January 2026. We believe we will be able to refinance our debt agreements prior to their maturities. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations, together with amounts available for borrowing under each of our revolving credit facility and the OEG revolving credit facility, will be adequate to fund our general short-term commitments, as well as: (i) current operating expenses, (ii) interest expense on long-term debt obligations, (iii) financing lease and operating lease obligations, (iv) declared dividends and (v) the capital expenditures described above. Our ability to draw on our credit facility and the OEG revolving credit facility is subject to the satisfaction of provisions of the credit facility and the OEG revolving credit facility, as applicable. Our outstanding principal debt agreements are described below. At September 30, 2024, there were no defaults under the covenants related to our outstanding debt. Principal Debt Agreements Credit Facility . On May 18, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement (as supplemented, the Credit Agreement among the Company, as a guarantor, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, certain other subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, as guarantors, certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, as pledgors, the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, which replaced the Company s previous credit facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a 700.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolver and a senior secured term loan B (the Term Loan B (in the original principal amount of 500.0 million, which was reduced to 295.0 million on March 28, 2024), as well as an accordion feature that will allow us to increase the facilities following the closing date by an aggregate total of up to 475 million, which may be allocated between the Revolver and the Term Loan B at our option. Each of the Revolver and the Term Loan B is guaranteed by us, each of our subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Hotels properties and certain of our other subsidiaries. Each of the Revolver and the Term Loan B is secured by equity pledges of our subsidiaries that are the fee owners of Gaylord Opryland and Gaylord Texan, their respective direct and indirect parent entities, and the equity of Ryman Hotel Operations Holdco, LLC, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company. Assets and equity of OEG are not subject to the liens of the Credit Agreement. In addition, each of the Revolver and Term Loan B contains certain covenants which, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, investments, dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The material financial covenants, ratios or tests contained in the Credit Agreement are as follows: We must maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not greater than 6.50x. We must maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.50x. Our secured indebtedness must not exceed 30 of consolidated total asset value. Our secured recourse indebtedness must not exceed 10 of consolidated total asset value. Unencumbered leverage ratio must not exceed 55 (with the ability to surge to 60 in connection with a material acquisition). Unencumbered adjusted NOI to unsecured interest expense ratio not to be less than 2.0x. 
 If an event of default shall occur and be continuing under the Credit Agreement, the commitments under the Credit Agreement may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable. Revolving Credit Facility . The maturity date of the Revolver is May 18, 2027, with the option to extend the maturity date for a maximum of one additional year through either (i) a single 12-month extension option or (ii) two individual 6-

 month extensions. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at our option, either (i) Adjusted Term SOFR plus the applicable margin ranging from 1.40 to 2.00 , (ii) Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus the applicable margin ranging from 1.40 to 2.00 or (iii) a base rate as set forth in the Credit Agreement plus the applicable margin ranging from 0.40 to 1.00 , with each option dependent upon our funded debt to total asset value ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Principal is payable in full at maturity, and the Revolver was undrawn at closing. For purposes of the Revolver, Adjusted Term SOFR is calculated as the sum of Term SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.10 (all as more specifically described in the Credit Agreement), subject to a floor of 0.00 . Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is calculated as the sum of SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.10 (all as more specifically described in the Credit Agreement), subject to a floor of 0.00 . At September 30, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolver, and the lending banks had issued 4.3 million of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, which left 695.7 million of availability under the Revolver (subject to the satisfaction of debt incurrence tests under the indentures governing our 1 Billion 6.50 Senior Notes, our 700 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2027 (the 700 Million 4.75 Senior Notes ), our 600 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2029 (the 600 Million 4.50 Senior Notes and our 400 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2028 (the 400 Million 7.25 Senior Notes ), which we met at September 30, 2024). Term Loan B. The Term Loan B has a maturity date of May 18, 2030. Prior to the effectiveness of the Incremental Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings under the Term Loan B were, at our option, either (i) Term SOFR plus 2.75 , (ii) Daily Simple SOFR plus 2.75 or (iii) a base rate as set forth in the Credit Agreement plus 1.75 . In addition, if for any fiscal year, there is Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement), an additional principal amount is required. Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan B that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. On April 12, 2024, we entered into an Incremental Tranche B Term Loan Agreement (the Incremental Agreement ), which supplements the Credit Agreement and includes the addition of certain new lenders and the removal of certain other lenders. The Incremental Agreement reduces the applicable interest rate margins for the loans advanced under the refinanced Term Loan B. The applicable interest rate margins for the refinanced Term Loan B under the Incremental Agreement are (i) 2.25 for SOFR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) 1.25 for base rate loans. At September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the Term Loan B was Term SOFR plus 2.25 . The Incremental Agreement did not change the maturity dates under the Credit Agreement or result in any increase in principal indebtedness. In addition, the Incremental Agreement confirms that the annual amortization under the Term Loan B is 1 of the refinanced 295.0 million outstanding principal amount, with the balance due at maturity. At September 30, 2024, 293.5 million in borrowings were outstanding under the Term Loan B. For purposes of the Term Loan B, each of Term SOFR and Daily Simple SOFR are subject to a floor of 0.00 . 1 Billion 6.50 Senior Notes.

 administrative agent. The Gaylord Rockies Loan consisted of an 800.0 million secured term loan facility, with a maturity date of July 2, 2024 with two, one-year extension options remaining, subject to certain requirements in the Gaylord Rockies Loan, and bore interest at Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus 2.50 . We previously entered into an interest rate swap to fix the SOFR portion of the interest rate at 5.2105 for the fifth year of the loan. We designated this interest rate swap as an effective cash flow hedge. On March 28, 2024, we paid off the Gaylord Rockies Loan with proceeds from the 1 Billion 6.50 Senior Notes discussed above and terminated the interest rate swap. OEG Credit Agreement . On June 28, 2024, OEG Borrower, LLC OEG Borrower and OEG Finance, LLC OEG Finance ), each a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of OEG, entered into a certain First Amendment, which amends the Credit Agreement dated as of June 16, 2022 among OEG Borrower, as borrower, OEG Finance, certain subsidiaries of OEG Borrower from time to time party thereto as guarantors, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Original OEG Credit Agreement ). As amended, the credit facility (the Amended OEG Credit Agreement includes certain amended terms including lower interest rates, extended maturities and modifications to various covenants. The Amended OEG Credit Agreement provides for (i) a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate amount of 300.0 million (the OEG Term Loan and (ii) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 80.0 million (the OEG Revolver ). The OEG Term Loan refinances and replaces the former term loan in the outstanding principal amount of 294.8 million as of June 28, 2024 and the OEG Revolver refinances and replaces the senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 65.0 million. At September 30, 2024, 16.0 million was outstanding under the OEG Revolver. The OEG Term Loan and the OEG Revolver are each secured by substantially all of the assets of OEG Finance and each of its subsidiaries (other than Block 21-related subsidiaries, as more specifically described in the Amended OEG Credit Agreement). The OEG Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to either, at OEG Borrower s election, as of the closing contemplated by the Amended OEG Credit Agreement: (a) the Alternate Base Rate plus 2.50 or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR plus 3.50 (all as more specifically described in the Amended OEG Credit Agreement). Borrowings under the OEG Revolver bear interest at a rate equal to either, at OEG Borrower s election, as of the closing contemplated by the Amended OEG Credit Agreement: (a) the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amended OEG Credit Agreement) or (b) Adjusted Term SOFR plus the Applicable Rate. Under the Amended OEG Credit Agreement, (i) the Applicable Rate for Alternative Base Rate loans will be between 2.75 and 2.25 and (ii) the Applicable Rate for Adjusted Term SOFR loans will be between 3.75 and 3.25 , in each of (i) and (ii) based upon the First Lien Leverage Ratio of OEG Finance and its consolidated subsidiaries (as more specifically described in the Amended OEG Credit Agreement). The Applicable Rate for borrowings as of September 30, 2024 is 2.50 for Alternative Base Rate Loans and 3.50 for Adjusted Term SOFR loans. The OEG Term Loan matures on June 28, 2031 and the OEG Revolver matures on June 28, 2029. OEG Borrower used the proceeds of the OEG Term Loan to refinance the original term loan under the Original OEG Credit Agreement. Block 21 CMBS Loan . At the closing of the purchase of Block 21 in May 2022, a subsidiary of the Company assumed the 136 million, ten-year, non-recourse term loan secured by a mortgage on Block 21 (the Block 21 CMBS Loan ). The Block 21 CMBS Loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.58 per annum, payable monthly, matures January 5, 2026, and payments are due monthly based on a 30-year amortization. At September 30, 2024, 129.7 million was outstanding under the Block 21 CMBS Loan. The Block 21 CMBS Loan contains customary financial covenants and other restrictions, including sponsor net worth and liquidity requirements, and debt service coverage ratio targets that Block 21 must meet in order to avoid a Trigger Period, the occurrence of which does not constitute a default. The disruption caused by a significant renovation of the rooms and public spaces at the W Hotel, which is nearing completion, negatively impacted the results of Block 21 and resulted in the Trigger Period expected to be effective starting September 30, 2024. During the Trigger Period, cash in excess of operating expenses, debt service, certain reserves and operating expenses is deposited in a reserve account and held until Block 21 exits the Trigger Period by achieving a specified minimum debt service coverage ratio on a trailing twelve-month basis, at which time the reserved cash will be released to Block 21 and its owner.

 Additional Debt Limitations . Pursuant to the terms of the management agreements and pooling agreement with Marriott for our Gaylord Hotels properties, excluding Gaylord Rockies, we are subject to certain debt limitations described below. The management agreements provide for the following limitations on indebtedness encumbering a hotel: The aggregate principal balance of all mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the hotel shall be no greater than 75 of the fair market value of the hotel; and The ratio of (a) aggregate Operating Profit (as defined in the management agreement) in the 12 months prior to the closing on the mortgage or mezzanine debt to (b) annual debt service for the hotel shall equal or exceed 1.2:1; but is subject to the pooling agreement described below. 
 The pooled limitations on Secured Debt (as defined in the pooling agreement) are as follows: The aggregate principal balance of all mortgage and mezzanine debt on Pooled Hotels (as defined in the pooling agreement), shall be no more than 75 of the fair market value of Pooled Hotels. The ratio of (a) aggregate Operating Profit (as defined in the pooling agreement) of Pooled Hotels in the 12 months prior to closing on any mortgage or mezzanine debt to (b) annual debt service for the Pooled Hotels, shall equal or exceed 1.2:1. 
 Gaylord Rockies is not a Pooled Hotel for this purpose. Estimated Interest on Principal Debt Agreements Based on the stated interest rates on our fixed-rate debt and the rates in effect at September 30, 2024 for our variable-rate debt after considering interest rate swaps, our estimated interest obligations through 2028 are 805.3 million. These estimated obligations are 52.1 million for the remainder of 2024, 208.1 million in 2025, 201.1 million in 2026, 192.3 million in 2027, and 151.6 million in 2028. Variable rates, as well as outstanding principal balances, could change in future periods. See Principal Debt Agreements above for a discussion of our outstanding long-term debt. See Supplemental Cash Flow Information in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of the interest we paid during 2023, 2022 and 2021. Inflation Inflation has had a more meaningful impact on our business during recent periods than in historical periods. However, favorable ADR and outside-the-room spend in our Hospitality segment and business levels in our Entertainment segment in recent periods have reduced the impact of increased operating costs, including increased insurance, utilities and other costs, on our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, increased interest rates have driven higher interest expense on our debt. In an effort to mitigate the impact of increased interest rates, at September 30, 2024, 85 of our outstanding debt is fixed-rate debt, after considering the impact of interest rate swaps. We continue to monitor inflationary pressures and may need to consider potential mitigation actions in future periods. A prolonged inflationary environment could adversely affect our operating costs, customer spending and bookings, and our financial results.
