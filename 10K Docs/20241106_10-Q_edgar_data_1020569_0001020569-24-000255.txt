 DEBT COVENANTS 
 The Credit Agreement, our bond indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take other specified corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our bond indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement requires that we satisfy a net total lease adjusted leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio on a quarterly basis, and our bond indentures require that, among other things, we satisfy a leverage ratio (not lease adjusted) or a fixed charge coverage ratio (not lease adjusted) as a condition to taking actions such as paying dividends and incurring indebtedness. 
 The Credit Agreement uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense ("EBITDAR") based calculations and the bond indentures use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance for purposes of calculating leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The EBITDAR- and EBITDA-based leverage calculations include our consolidated subsidiaries, other than those we have designated as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries" as defined in the Credit Agreement and bond indentures. Generally, the Credit Agreement and the bond indentures use a trailing four fiscal quarter basis for purposes of the relevant calculations and require certain adjustments and exclusions for purposes of those calculations, which make the calculation of financial performance for purposes of those calculations under the Credit Agreement and bond indentures not directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein. We are in compliance with our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the Credit Agreement, our bond indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness as of September 30, 2024. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 We have made statements in this Quarterly Report that constitute "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws. These forward-looking statements concern our current expectations regarding our future results from operations, economic performance, financial condition, goals, strategies, investment objectives, plans and achievements.

 the impact of service interruptions or equipment damage and the cost of power on our data center operations; 
 the cost or potential liabilities associated with real estate necessary for our business; 
 unexpected events, including those resulting from climate change or geopolitical events, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations; 
 failures to implement and manage new IT systems; 
 other trends in competitive or economic conditions affecting our financial condition or results of operations not presently contemplated; and

OVERVIEW 
 The following discussions set forth, for the periods indicated, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Significant trends and changes are discussed for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 within each section. Trends and changes that are consistent for both the three and nine month periods are not repeated and are discussed on a year to date basis only. 
 PROJECT MATTERHORN 
 In September 2022, we announced a global program designed to accelerate the growth of our business ("Project Matterhorn"). Project Matterhorn investments focus on transforming our operating model to a global operating model. Project Matterhorn focuses on the formation of a solution-based sales approach that is designed to allow us to optimize our shared services and best practices to better serve our customers' needs. We are investing to accelerate growth and to capture a greater share of the large, global addressable markets in which we operate. We expect to incur approximately 150.0 million in costs annually related to Project Matterhorn from 2023 through 2025. Costs are comprised of (1) restructuring costs, which include (i) site consolidation and other related exit costs, (ii) employee severance costs and (iii) certain professional fees associated with these activities, and (2) other transformation costs, which include professional fees such as project management costs and costs for third party consultants who are assisting in the enablement of our growth initiatives. 
 See Note 11 to Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for more information on Restructuring and other transformation costs. 
 GENERAL 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - KEY TRENDS 
 Our organic storage rental revenue growth is primarily driven by revenue management in our Global RIM Business segment, where we expect volume to be relatively stable in the near term, as well as by growth in our Global Data Center Business segment, primarily driven by lease commencements. 
 Our organic service revenue growth is primarily due to increases in our service activity. We expect organic service revenue growth for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 to benefit from our new and existing digital offerings and asset lifecycle management ("ALM") business, as well as our traditional services . 
 We expect continued total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 as a result of our focus on new product and service offerings, innovation, customer solutions and market expansion in line with our Project Matterhorn objectives. 
 Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) and Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists of the following:

NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 ADJUSTED EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization (inclusive of our share of Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated joint ventures), and excluding certain items we do not believe to be indicative of our core operating results, specifically: 
 EXCLUDED Acquisition and Integration Costs (as defined below) 
 Restructuring and other transformation 
 Loss (gain) on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (including real estate) 
 Other expense (income), net 
 Stock-based compensation expense 
 Intangible impairments 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues. We also show Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for each of our reportable segments under "Results of Operations Segment Analysis" below. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA excludes both interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), such as operating income, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities.

ADJUSTED EPS 
 We define Adjusted EPS as reported earnings per share fully diluted from net income (loss) attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated (inclusive of our share of adjusted losses (gains) from our unconsolidated joint ventures) and excluding certain items, specifically: 
 EXCLUDED Acquisition and Integration Costs 
 Restructuring and other transformation 
 Loss (gain) on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (including real estate) 
 Other expense (income), net 
 Stock-based compensation expense 
 Non-cash amortization related to derivative instruments 
 Tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items 
 Amortization related to the write-off of certain customer relationship intangible assets 
 
 We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS is of value to our current and potential investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.

Our structural tax rate for purposes of the calculation of Adjusted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 15.1 and 13.3 , respectively. The Tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items is calculated using the current quarter's estimate of the annual structural tax rate. This may result in the current period adjustment plus prior period reported quarterly adjustments not summing to the full year adjustment.

FFO (NAREIT) AND FFO (NORMALIZED) 
 Funds from operations ("FFO") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as net income (loss) excluding depreciation on real estate assets, losses and gains on sale of real estate, net of tax, and amortization of data center leased-based intangibles ("FFO (Nareit)"). We calculate our FFO measures, including FFO (Nareit), adjusting for our share of reconciling items from our unconsolidated joint ventures. FFO (Nareit) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under GAAP, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO (Nareit) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. Our most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO (Nareit) is net income (loss). 
 We modify FFO (Nareit), as is common among REITs seeking to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business ("FFO (Normalized)"). Our definition of FFO (Normalized) excludes certain items included in FFO (Nareit) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: 
 EXCLUDED 
 Acquisition and Integration Costs 
 Restructuring and other transformation 
 Loss (gain) on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (excluding real estate) 
 Other expense (income), net 
 Stock-based compensation expense 
 Non-cash amortization related to derivative instruments 
 Real estate financing lease depreciation 
 Tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items 
 Intangible impairments

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting estimates include the following, which are listed in no particular order: 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Accounting for Acquisitions 
 Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets 
 Income Taxes 
 Further detail regarding our critical accounting estimates can be found in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included therein. We have determined that no material changes concerning our critical accounting estimates have occurred since December 31, 2023.

 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 
 Interest expense, net increased by 93.0 million to 527.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 434.1 million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period as well as an increase in our weighted average interest rate. Our weighted average interest rate, inclusive of the fees associated with our outstanding letters of credit, was 5.7 and 5.5 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 (2) Other, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consists of approximately 29.2 million in charges associated with the agreement to purchase the remaining interest in the Web Werks JV (as defined and discussed below) as well as losses on our equity method investments and the change in value of our deferred purchase obligations. 
 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 
 We provide for income taxes during interim periods based on our estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

 The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 and our overall effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were the lack of tax benefits recognized for the year to date ordinary losses of certain entities, the benefits derived from the dividends paid deduction and the differences in the tax rates to which our foreign earnings are subject. In addition, we recorded gains and losses in Other expense (income), net during the period, for which there was no tax impact.

 organic service revenue growth in our ALM business reflecting increased volume and improved component pricing; and 
 Adjusted EBITDA is relatively consistent with the prior year period driven by service revenue improvement in our ALM business, including the Regency Technologies acquisition, offset by higher compensation expense, professional fees and IT costs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 GENERAL 
 We expect to meet our short-term and long-term cash flow requirements through cash generated from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under the Credit Agreement (as defined below), as well as other potential financings (such as the issuance of debt).

 PROJECT MATTERHORN 
 As disclosed above, in September 2022, we announced Project Matterhorn. We estimate that the implementation of Project Matterhorn will result in costs of approximately 150.0 million per year from 2023 through 2025. Total costs related to Project Matterhorn for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and from the inception of Project Matterhorn through September 30, 2024, were approximately 124.6 million and 341.7 million, respectively, which are comprised of (1) restructuring costs, which include (i) site consolidation and other related exit costs, (ii) employee severance costs and (iii) certain professional fees associated with these activities and (2) other transformation costs, which include professional fees such as project management costs and costs for third party consultants who are assisting in the enablement of our growth initiatives.

 NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
 Our data center operations include two joint ventures which are consolidated within our Global Data Center Business segment as we have concluded we have control over the joint ventures. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a put option available to our partner in our Iron Mountain Data Centers Virginia 4/5 JV, LP joint venture expired, triggering a change in the presentation of the related noncontrolling interest. The noncontrolling interest of approximately million was previously presented as Redeemable noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is now presented as Noncontrolling interests within stockholders equity in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement with a partner to form our Iron Mountain Data Centers Virginia 6/7 JV, LLC joint venture, which resulted in Noncontrolling interests of approximately million in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024.

DEBT COVENANTS 
 The Credit Agreement, our bond indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take other specified corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our bond indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement requires that we satisfy a net total lease adjusted leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio on a quarterly basis, and our bond indentures require that, among other things, we satisfy a leverage ratio (not lease adjusted) or a fixed charge coverage ratio (not lease adjusted) as a condition to taking actions such as paying dividends and incurring indebtedness. 
 The Credit Agreement uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense ("EBITDAR") based calculations and the bond indentures use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance for purposes of calculating leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The EBITDAR- and EBITDA-based leverage calculations include our consolidated subsidiaries, other than those we have designated as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries" as defined in the Credit Agreement and bond indentures. Generally, the Credit Agreement and the bond indentures use a trailing four fiscal quarter basis for purposes of the relevant calculations and require certain adjustments and exclusions for purposes of those calculations, which make the calculation of financial performance for purposes of those calculations under the Credit Agreement and bond indentures not directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein. These adjustments can be significant. For example, the calculation of financial performance under the Credit Agreement and certain of our bond indentures includes (subject to specified exceptions and caps) adjustments for non-cash charges and for expected benefits associated with (i) completed acquisitions, (ii) certain executed lease agreements associated with our data center business that have yet to commence, and (iii) restructuring and other strategic initiatives. The calculation of financial performance under our other bond indentures includes, for example, adjustments for non-cash charges and for expected benefits associated with (i) completed acquisitions and (ii) events that are extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring. 
 Our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 MAXIMUM/MINIMUM ALLOWABLE Net total lease adjusted leverage ratio 5.0 Maximum allowable of 7.0 Fixed charge coverage ratio 2.4 Minimum allowable of 1.5 
 We are in compliance with our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the Credit Agreement, our bond indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness as of September 30, 2024. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 
 Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures. 
 
 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
 INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS 
 We utilize interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of our floating rate indebtedness. Certain of our interest rate swap agreements have notional amounts that will increase with the underlying hedged transaction. Under our interest rate swap agreements, we receive variable rate interest payments associated with the notional amount of each interest rate swap, based upon SOFR, in exchange for the payment of fixed interest rates as specified in the interest rate swap agreements. Our interest rate swap agreements are marked to market at the end of each reporting period, representing the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements, and any changes in fair value are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive items, net. Unrealized gains are recognized as assets, while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have approximately 1,354.0 million and 520.0 million, respectively, in notional value outstanding on our interest rate swap agreements. As of September 30, 2024, our interest rate swap agreements have maturity dates ranging from October 2025 through May 2027.

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS 
 We utilize cross-currency swaps to hedge the variability of exchange rate impacts between the United States dollar and the Euro. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have approximately 509.2 million in notional value outstanding on cross-currency interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2024, our cross-currency interest rate swaps have maturity dates ranging from August 2025 through February 2026. 
 We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as hedges of net investments in certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries and they require an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. These cross-currency swap agreements are marked to market at the end of each reporting period, representing the fair values of the cross-currency swap agreements, and any changes in fair value are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive items, net. Unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. The excluded component of our cross-currency swap agreements is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive items, net and amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis. 
 
 ACQUISITIONS 
 WISETEK 
 On September 20, 2024, in order to further expand our ALM business, we acquired 100 of Wisetek Solutions Limited ("Wisetek"), an IT asset disposition services provider offering services across the globe with operations facilities in the United States, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Thailand, for (i) cash consideration of approximately 46.6 million Euros (or approximately 51.9 million, based upon the exchange rate between the Euro and the United States dollar on the closing date of this acquisition), subject to adjustments, and (ii) up to 4.2 million Euros (or approximately 4.7 million, based upon the exchange rate between the Euro and the United States dollar as of September 30, 2024) of additional consideration, payable based on the achievement of certain gross profit targets through September 2026.

The present value of the January 2025 Payment is included as a component of Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024. The agreement for the Regency Transaction also includes a performance-based contingent consideration with a potential earnout range from zero to 200.0 million based upon achievement of certain three-year cumulative revenue targets, which would be payable in 2027, if earned (the Regency Deferred Purchase Obligation ). The preliminary fair value estimate of the Regency Deferred Purchase Obligation as of the acquisition date was approximately 78.4 million. The fair value of the Regency Deferred Purchase Obligation is included as a component of Other long-term liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024. Subsequent increases or decreases in the fair value estimate of the Regency Deferred Purchase Obligation, as well as the accretion of the discount to present value, is included as a component of Other expense (income), net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations until the deferred purchase obligation is settled or paid.

 ______________________________________________ 
 THIRD AMENDMENT 
 ______________________________________________ 
 Iron Mountain Incorporated (the Company hereby amends the Iron Mountain Incorporated Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, as previously amended (the Plan ), effective October 17, 2024. 
 1. Section 5.6(b) of the Plan, as previously amended, shall be amended and restated to read as follows 
 (b) Timing . As long as the Company maintains a Rabbi Trust, the Company shall remit cash and or Common Stock, as agreed to by the Committee and the trustee, representing the compensation deferred under this Plan to the trustee of the Rabbi Trust on a quarterly basis. The trustee shall acquire shares of Common Stock as soon as practicable following its receipt of any cash. In general, it is contemplated that the Company shall remit compensation deferred to the trustee at the same time it remits a cash payment of Fees or settles a Stock Grant to any member of the Board who is eligible for but does not otherwise elect to participate in the Plan, or within ten business days following the close of a calendar quarter if no such cash payment is issued. If no Rabbi Trust is maintained, the compensation deferred under this Plan shall be treated as hypothetically invested in Common Stock as of the date specified in the preceding sentence and calculated using the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date in question. With respect to any distribution paid hereunder the distribution shall consist of shares of Common Stock, provided, that the Participant shall also receive, in cash, any cash allocated to the Participant's Account representing fractional shares of Common Stock. 
 2. Section 6.1(c) of the Plan, as previously amended, shall be amended and restated to read as follows 
 The following are the available choices for the form of payment of a Participant's Account with respect to a particular Plan Year's Deferred Compensation and earnings thereon 
 (1) A single lump sum in Common Stock or 
 (2) Substantially equal annual installments in Common Stock over a period of either five or ten years. Installment payments are not available if the payout is made upon the Participant's Disability or other Separation from Service. 
 4866-2549-3222, v.4 

A Participant's Disability or other Separation from Service shall not cause any acceleration of his receipt of installment payments that are then in the course of payment. In all events, cash allocated to a Participant's Account as a result of a failure to purchase fractional shares of Common Stock shall be distributed in cash. An election made by a Participant pursuant to the second sentence of Section 6.l(a) may apply to a choice as to the form of payment pursuant to this Section 6.l(c), as well as the commencement date of payment, subject to such restrictions as are specified in that sentence. 
 Any existing election(s) by a Participant (including for purposes of Section 6.4) to receive a distribution in the form of cash shall, with respect to such form of payment, be disregarded and all distributions of a Participant's Account, whether in the form of a lump sum or installments, shall be made solely in Common Stock and not in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, any prior right or election to receive a distribution in the form of cash shall, as of the effective date of this Third Amendment, be converted into a right to receive a distribution in the form of a fixed number of shares of Common Stock. 
 3. Section 6.4 of the Plan shall be amended and restated to read as follows 
 Death Before Payments Commence or are Completed . If a Participant dies while employed or while receiving installment payments, the entire remaining value of his Account shall be paid during the second calendar month following the Participant's death to the Participant's designated Beneficiary in a single lump sum in Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares), as determined at the Participant's election pursuant to Section 6.l(c). 
 4. Except as hereinabove specifically amended, all provisions of the Plan, as previously amended, shall continue in full force and effect provided, however, that the Company hereby reserves the power from time to time to further amend the Plan.
