EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of Host Hotels Resorts, Inc. and Host Hotels Resorts, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context requires otherwise, references to Host Inc. mean Host Hotels Resorts, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and references to Host L.P. mean Host Hotels Resorts, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries, in cases where it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P. We use the terms we, our or the company to refer to Host Inc. and Host L.P. together, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
 Host Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust REIT ). Host Inc. owns properties and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99 of the partnership interests OP units ). The remaining OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. As the sole general partner of Host L.P., Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P. s day-to-day management and control. Management operates Host Inc. and Host L.P. as one enterprise. The management of Host Inc. consists of the same persons who direct the management of Host L.P. As general partner with control of Host L.P., Host Inc. consolidates Host L.P. for financial reporting purposes, and Host Inc. does not have significant assets other than its investment in Host L.P. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are substantially the same on their respective condensed consolidated financial statements and the disclosures of Host Inc. and Host L.P. also are substantially similar. For these reasons, we believe that the combination into a single report of the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of Host Inc. and Host L.P. results in benefits to management and investors. 
 The substantive difference between the filings of Host Inc. and Host L.P. is that Host Inc. is a REIT with public stock, while Host L.P. is a partnership with no publicly traded equity. In the condensed consolidated financial statements, this difference primarily is reflected in the equity (or partners capital for Host L.P.) section of the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of equity (or partners capital for Host L.P.). Apart from the different equity treatment, the condensed consolidated financial statements of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are nearly identical. 
 This combined Form 10-Q for Host Inc. and Host L.P. includes, for each entity, separate interim financial statements (but combined footnotes), separate reports on disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and separate CEO/CFO certifications. In addition, with respect to any other financial and non-financial disclosure items required by Form 10-Q, any material differences between Host Inc. and Host L.P. are discussed separately herein. For a more detailed discussion of the substantive differences between Host Inc. and Host L.P. and why we believe the combined filing results in benefits to investors, see the discussion in the combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the heading Explanatory Note.

Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full year performance because of the effect of seasonal variations. 
 of the partnerships in which we own an interest are considered variable interest entities ("VIEs"), as the general partner of these partnerships maintains control over the decisions that most significantly impact such partnerships. These VIEs include the operating partnership, Host L.P., which is consolidated by Host Inc., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and holds approximately of the limited partner interests; the consolidated partnership that owns the Houston Airport Marriott at George Bush Intercontinental; and unconsolidated partnerships that own hotel properties, of which we hold limited partner interests ranging from - .

 of our properties in Florida were temporarily closed, of which have reopened. The most significant damage sustained during the storms occurred at The Don CeSar, which closed on September 25, 2024, following a mandatory evacuation order prior to the landfall of Hurricane Helene. The Don CeSar sustained extensive damage due to storm surge, which flooded the lower level of the hotel, including the fitness center, two food and beverage ("F B") outlets, retail outlets and the resort's beach club. Remediation efforts are underway, and we currently expect a phased reopening of the hotel beginning late in the first quarter of 2025. Limited property damage was reported at the other Florida properties within our consolidated portfolio. 
 We are still evaluating the scope of property damage and business interruption loss at our Florida properties. For Hurricane Helene, which occurred in the third quarter and primarily impacted The Don CeSar, we are to estimate the total loss at this time, due to the proximity of the hurricane to quarter end, the added impact of Hurricane Milton in early fourth quarter, and ongoing investigation into remediation and reopening requirements. For the property loss that occurred during the third quarter, we expect our insurance coverage to sufficiently cover the property damage in excess of our insurance deductible; therefore we have not recorded any loss on the condensed consolidated statements of operations as of September 30, 2024. However, we will have ongoing remediation efforts and business interruption at The Don CeSar subsequent to quarter end. Additionally, The Don CeSar and several of our other Florida properties were affected by Hurricane Milton, which occurred in the fourth quarter. For both hurricanes, we will record an insurance receivable based on the anticipated insurance proceeds, not to exceed the expected loss, in the fourth quarter when the loss can be reliably estimated. We are

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 In this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, expect, may, intend, predict, project, plan, will, estimate and other similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions and forecasts of future results. Forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. 
 The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: 
 the effect on lodging demand of (i) changes in national and local economic and business conditions, including concerns about U.S. economic growth and the potential for an economic recession in the United States or globally, the recent high level of inflation, elevated interest rates, global economic prospects, consumer confidence and the value of the U.S. dollar, and (ii) factors that may shape public perception of travel to a particular location, including natural disasters, such as the Maui wildfires in 2023, weather events, such as Hurricane Ian in 2022 and Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024, or extreme precipitation, pandemics and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the occurrence or potential occurrence of terrorist attacks, all of which will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services; 
 risks that U.S. immigration policies and border closings, visa processing times, travel restrictions or advisories, changes in energy prices or changes in foreign exchange rates will suppress international travel to the United States generally or decrease the labor pool, and risks that international U.S. outbound travel may remain elevated relative to historic levels; 
 the impact of geopolitical developments outside the U.S., such as large-scale wars or international conflicts, slowing global growth, or trade tensions and tariffs between the United States and its trading partners such as China, all of which could affect global travel and lodging demand within the United States; 
 volatility in global financial and credit markets, which could materially adversely affect U.S. and global economic conditions, business activity, and lodging demand as well as negatively impact our ability to obtain financing and increase our borrowing costs; 
 future U.S. governmental action to address budget deficits through reductions in spending and similar austerity measures, as well as the impact of potential U.S. government shutdowns, all of which could materially adversely affect U.S. economic conditions, business activity, credit availability and borrowing costs; 
 operating risks associated with the hotel business, including the effect of labor stoppages or strikes, increasing operating or labor costs, including increased labor costs in the current inflationary environment, the ability of our managers to adequately staff our hotels as a result of shortages in labor, severance and furlough payments to hotel employees or changes in workplace rules that affect labor costs; 
 the effect of rating agency downgrades of our debt securities or on the cost and availability of new debt financings; 
 the reduction in our operating flexibility and the limitation on our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and make distributions resulting from restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and other risks associated with the amount of our indebtedness or related to restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, including the risk that a default could occur; 
 
 22 

our ability to maintain our hotels in a first-class manner, including meeting capital expenditures requirements, and the effect of renovations, including temporary closures, on our hotel occupancy and financial results; 
 the ability of our hotels to compete effectively against other lodging businesses in the highly competitive markets in which we operate in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate structures; 
 our ability to acquire or develop additional hotels and the risk that potential acquisitions or developments may not perform in accordance with our expectations; 
 the ability to complete hotel renovations on schedule and on, or under, budget and the potential for increased costs and construction delays due to shortages of supplies as a result of supply chain disruptions; 
 relationships with property managers and joint venture partners and our ability to realize the expected benefits of our joint ventures and other strategic relationships; 
 risks associated with a single manager, Marriott International, managing a significant percentage of our hotels; 
 changes in the desirability of the geographic regions of the hotels in our portfolio or in the travel patterns of hotel customers; 
 the growth of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries in attracting and retaining customers which compete with our hotels; 
 our ability to recover fully under our existing insurance policies for terrorist acts and natural disasters and our ability to maintain adequate or full replacement cost all-risk property insurance policies on our hotels on commercially reasonable terms; 
 the effect of a data breach or significant disruption of hotel operator information technology networks as a result of cyber-attacks; 
 the effects of tax legislative action and other changes in laws and regulations, or the interpretation thereof, including the need for compliance with new environmental and safety requirements; 
 the ability of Host Inc. and each of the REITs acquired, established or to be established by Host Inc. to continue to satisfy complex rules in order to qualify as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes and Host Inc. s and Host L.P. s ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, and similar entities to be acquired or established by us, to operate effectively within the limitations imposed by these rules; and 
 risks associated with our ability to execute our dividend policy, including factors such as investment activity, operating results and the economic outlook, any or all of which may influence the decision of our board of directors as to whether to pay future dividends at levels previously disclosed or to use available cash to pay special dividends. 
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions, including those risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that we will attain these expectations or that any deviations will not be material.

 (1) EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA re , NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and comparable hotel operating results (including hotel revenues and hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and "Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results" for more information on these measures, including why we believe these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally, comparable hotel results and statistics are based on 79 comparable hotels as of September 30, 2024 and include adjustments for non-comparable hotels, dispositions and acquisitions. See Comparable Hotel RevPAR Overview for results of the portfolio based on our ownership period, without these adjustments. 
 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 105 million, or 8.6 , and 268 million, or 6.7 , as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and year-to-date 2023, respectively. 2024 results benefited from the 2024 acquisitions of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown, 1 Hotel Central Park and The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay. Year-to-date 2024 results also benefited from the results of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed in the first half of 2023. In addition, group business continues to drive improvements in food and beverage revenues. 
 
 Comparable hotel Total RevPAR increased 3.1 and 1.6 for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, compared to 2023, due primarily to improvements in food and beverage revenues driven by continued strength in group business, as well as an increase in other revenues from ancillary spend. Comparable hotel RevPAR increased 0.8 and 0.2 for the quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, reflecting continued strong group demand, along with moderating domestic leisure demand and the slow, yet improving, recovery in Maui. 
 
 24 

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR in our New Orleans and Miami markets led the portfolio with increases of 35.2 and 15.7 , respectively, in the third quarter, driven by occupancy growth as a result of strong group demand. Downtown markets such as Houston, Boston and New York also outperformed our portfolio with comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 9.8 , 8.8 and 8.3 , respectively, driven by strong group performance, which resulted in both occupancy improvements and rate increases. These strong performances were offset by comparable hotel Total RevPAR declines in our Atlanta, San Francisco/San Jose and Austin markets of 13.6 , 7.0 and 6.7 , respectively. The declines were driven primarily by a decline in business travel. In addition, comparable hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui market declined by 9.8 due to the continuing impacts of the August 2023 wildfires. 
 
 Operating profit 
 For the third quarter of 2024, operating profit margin under GAAP was 10.2 , a decline of 270 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023, resulting from a 25 million decrease in gains on insurance settlements. Comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 25.3 , a decline of 130 basis points, driven by Maui performance and the business interruption proceeds included in 2023, while the revenue growth was offset by higher wages and other inflationary pressures compared to third quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, operating profit margin under GAAP was 16.9 , an increase of 50 bps over 2023, benefiting from a 59 million increase in gains on insurance settlements year-to-date. Comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 29.8 , a decrease of 90 basis points compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting similar trends to the quarter results. 
 Net income, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted FFO per share 
 Net income decreased 29 million for the quarter, reflecting the decline in gains on insurance settlements of 25 million, while the year-to-date decrease of 20 million reflects a decline in gains on asset sales of 69 million, partially offset by an increase in gains on insurance settlements of 59 million. These changes led to a decrease in diluted earnings per share of 0.04, or 25.0 , and 0.01, or 1.2 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA re , which excludes gain on property insurance, among other items, decreased 37 million for the quarter and increased 32 million year-to-date. Third quarter 2023 results benefited from business interruption gains of 54 million, while none were recognized in third quarter 2024. The year-to-date increase was driven by operations from the recent acquisitions and The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian. Adjusted FFO per diluted share decreased 0.05, or 12.2 , for the third quarter and increased 0.05, or 3.4 , year-to-date, reflecting the changes in Adjusted EBITDA re . Adjusted FFO per diluted share was also impacted by an increase in interest expense due to 2024 senior notes issuances, which expense is included in Adjusted FFO per diluted share but not Adjusted EBITDA re . 
 
 Outlook 
 Consistent with the lodging industry, group business at our properties continued to improve and is expected to remain strong in the near-term. In addition, average rates remain elevated at our resorts compared to pre-pandemic levels, though they have moderated from post-pandemic highs. However, further growth has been hampered by the slow recovery from the wildfires in Maui, one of our largest markets by revenues, moderating domestic leisure transient demand driven by elevated travel to international destinations, and slow recovery post-pandemic in certain markets, such as San Francisco. On the macroeconomic front, Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus improved slightly from previous forecasts, estimating an increase in real U.S. GDP of 2.7 for 2024. Other recent data, particularly the September employment report, have reduced concerns that the labor market may cool too fast. Unemployment remains at low levels, falling for the second consecutive month to 4.1 , and inflation is nearing the Federal Reserve's target of 2 . However, business investment growth is anticipated to slow down for the remainder of the year, averaging 3.9 for 2024. Other risks to economic growth remain, including geopolitical instability throughout the globe and volatile oil prices. As a result, leading indicators point toward slower economic growth in the coming months. 
 In the long-term, hotel supply growth continues to remain below the historical average, although we expect to see above-average growth in a few markets where our hotels are located, such as Nashville and Austin. Supply chain challenges have resulted in project delays across the U.S., and a tight lending environment has created construction financing challenges for future projects. We anticipate that the construction pipeline will remain modest until macroeconomic uncertainty moderates and interest rates decline further. 
 Based on the trends noted, we continue to anticipate that comparable hotel RevPAR will be approximately flat to prior year. However, we do anticipate that the closure of The Don CeSar and business interruption at several of our other 
 
 25 

Florida properties, due to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, will negatively impact net income and Adjusted EBITDA re for 2024 by approximately 15 million. 
 As noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains uncertain reflecting varying analyst assumptions surrounding the impact of higher interest rates, inflation, ongoing labor shortages in key industries, the recovery in Maui and escalating geopolitical conflicts. Therefore, there can be no assurances as to the continued recovery in lodging demand for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated return of group and business travel or deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. 
 Strategic Initiatives 
 Acquisitions . During the third quarter, we acquired the fee simple interest in the 234-room 1 Hotel Central Park for a purchase price of 265 million. The hotel features 2,000 square feet of contiguous and flexible meeting space, a naturally lit fitness center and business center, and Jams, a three-meal restaurant and bar. 
 Additionally, we acquired the fee simple interest in the 450-room, 1,180 acre Turtle Bay Resort, located on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii, including a 49-acre land parcel entitled for development, for approximately 680 million, net of key money received from Marriott International as part of an agreement to transition management and convert the property to The Ritz-Carlton brand. The property has been renamed The Ritz-Carlton O ahu, Turtle Bay and features 450 rooms, all with ocean views, including 42 bungalows with direct beach access, a separate check-in, and a private pool. Other amenities include 18,000 square feet of indoor meeting space, a club lounge, six food and beverage outlets, seven retail spaces, a spa, fitness center, two golf courses, seven beaches, four resort pools, tennis and pickle ball courts, an equestrian center, a working farm, and access to 12 miles of oceanfront trails. 
 Financing Transactions. During the third quarter, we issued 700 million of 5.500 Series L senior notes for proceeds of 683 million, net of original issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The net proceeds from this issuance were used in part to repay all 525 million of borrowings then outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility, including amounts borrowed in connection with the acquisitions noted above. 
 Capital Projects. Year-to-date in 2024, we spent approximately 164 million on return on investment ("ROI") capital projects, 181 million on renewal and replacement projects, and 30 million on hurricane and other restoration work. 
 In collaboration with Hyatt, we initiated a transformational capital program in 2023 on six properties in our portfolio. These investments are intended to position the targeted hotels to compete better in their respective markets while seeking to enhance long-term performance. Through the third quarter of 2024, we spent approximately 94 million on this program, which is included in ROI capital projects. We expect to invest approximately 125 million to 200 million per year over the next three to four years on this program. Hyatt has agreed to provide additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees totaling 40 million to offset expected business disruptions. The full year ROI project spend below includes approximately 125 million to 140 million for this Hyatt transformational capital program. 
 For full year 2024, we expect total capital expenditures of 485 million to 580 million, consisting of ROI projects of approximately 225 million to 255 million, renewal and replacement expenditures of 225 million to 275 million, and 35 million to 50 million for reconstruction projects, including the final restoration work for the damage caused by Hurricane Ian, and estimated restoration spend in 2024 related to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Many of our hotels in Florida were affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which made landfall in September and October 2024, respectively. Due to evacuation mandates and/or loss of commercial power, four of our properties in Florida were temporarily closed, all of which have reopened except The Don CeSar. The enhanced resilience projects implemented during the reconstruction of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples were successful in minimizing damage to the resort during the two storms. While we are still evaluating the complete property and business interruption impacts of the storm, we have included an estimated forecast of reconstruction spend for 2024 and anticipate additional spend in 2025.

 Statement of Operations Results and Trends 
 Hotel Sales Overview 
 The following table presents total revenues in accordance with GAAP and includes all consolidated hotels (in millions, except percentages): 
 Quarter ended September 30, Year-to-date ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 
 2024 2023 Change 
 Revenues: Rooms 825 777 6.2 2,563 2,447 4.7 Food and beverage 365 328 11.3 1,285 1,174 9.5 Other 129 109 18.3 408 367 11.2 Total revenues 1,319 1,214 8.6 4,256 3,988 6.7 

27 

Total revenues for the third quarter and year-to-date increased 8.6 and 6.7 , respectively, compared to 2023, primarily due to the operations of our recent acquisitions, including 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024, 1 Hotel Central Park acquired in July 2024, and The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay acquired in July 2024 (collectively, the "2024 Acquisitions"). In addition, strong group business led to improvements in food and beverage revenues. The year-to-date increase also reflects the resumption of operations at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed during the first half of 2023 as a result of Hurricane Ian. 
 Rooms . Total rooms revenues increased 48 million, or 6.2 , and 116 million, or 4.7 , for the third quarter and year-to-date, respectively, compared to 2023, reflecting the operations of the 2024 Acquisitions and the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Rooms revenues at our comparable hotels increased 8 million, or 1.0 , for the third quarter and 15 million, or 0.6 , year-to-date driven by an increase in average room rate. 
 Food and beverage . Total food and beverage ("F B") revenues increased 37 million, or 11.3 , for the quarter and 111 million, or 9.5 , year-to-date compared to 2023, due to results of the 2024 Acquisitions and the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Comparable F B revenues increased 21 million, or 6.3 , and 46 million, or 3.8 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, driven by improvements in banquet and audio-visual revenues at resort and convention hotels as group demand remains strong. 
 Other revenues. Total other revenues increased 20 million, or 18.3 , and 41 million, or 11.2 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, compared to 2023, driven by results from the 2024 Acquisitions and the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Comparable other revenues increased 11 million, or 9.5 , for the quarter and 23 million, or 5.9 , year-to-date, primarily due to an increase in ancillary spend. 
 
 Property-level Operating Expenses 
 The following table presents property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP and includes all consolidated hotels (in millions, except percentages): 
 Quarter ended September 30, Year-to-date ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 
 2024 2023 Change 
 Expenses: Rooms 216 196 10.2 632 590 7.1 Food and beverage 267 241 10.8 848 773 9.7 Other departmental and support expenses 345 314 9.9 1,022 952 7.4 Management fees 55 51 7.8 193 185 4.3 Other property-level expenses 108 106 1.9 313 290 7.9 Depreciation and amortization 197 174 13.2 565 511 10.6 Total property-level operating expenses 1,188 1,082 9.8 3,573 3,301 8.2 
 Our operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. Rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet, audio-visual and outlet sales. However, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 57 of these expenses. For both the third quarter and year-to-date of 2024, these expenses increased approximately 5 on a per available room basis compared to 2023, primarily due to an overall increase in general wage rates and benefits. Wage and benefit rate inflation is expected to be approximately 5 in 2024. 
 Other property-level expenses consist of property taxes, the amounts and structure of which are highly dependent on local jurisdiction taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, all of which do not necessarily increase or decrease based on similar changes in revenues at our hotels.

The increase in expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date of 2024 compared to 2023 for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees was generally due to the corresponding increases in revenues due to the 2024 Acquisitions, the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, and also reflected increased expenses at our comparable hotels primarily due to increased wages and benefits, as described below: 
 
 Rooms. Rooms expenses increased 20 million, or 10.2 , and 42 million, or 7.1 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Our comparable hotels rooms expenses increased 11 million, or 5.4 , and 23 million, or 3.7 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, driven by an overall increase in wage rates. 
 Food and beverage . F B expenses increased 26 million, or 10.8 , and 75 million, or 9.7 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. For our comparable hotels, F B expenses increased 14 million, or 5.7 , and 34 million, or 4.3 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Overall, F B costs as a percentage of revenues remained consistent year over year. 
 Other departmental and support expenses . Other departmental and support expenses increased 31 million, or 9.9 , and 70 million, or 7.4 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. On a comparable hotel basis, other departmental and support expenses increased 12 million, or 3.6 , and 36 million, or 3.6 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. These increases were primarily due to higher wage expense. 
 Management fees . Total management fees increased 4 million, or 7.8 , for the quarter and 8 million, or 4.3 , year-to-date. Base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, increased 1 million, or 2.8 , and 8 million, or 7.1 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. At our comparable hotels, base management fees increased 2 million, or 5.9 , and 4 million, or 3.9 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, increased 3 million, or 20.0 , for the quarter and remained flat year-to-date. At our comparable hotels, incentive management fees increased 3 million, or 18.8 for the quarter, and decreased 3 million, or 4.1 , year-to-date. 
 Other property-level expenses. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. Other property-level expenses increased 2 million, or 1.9 , and 23 million, or 7.9 , for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, due primarily to increases in property insurance premiums and property taxes. Other property-level expenses at our comparable hotels decreased 1 million, or 1.0 for the quarter, and increased 16 million, or 5.6 , for the year-to-date.

 Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and year-to-date due primarily to higher outstanding debt balances during 2024 as we issued additional series of senior notes to fund our 2024 Acquisitions. The following table details our interest expense for the quarter and year-to-date (in millions): 
 Quarter ended September 30, Year-to-date ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cash interest expense 57 46 149 131 Non-cash interest expense 2 2 7 7 Non-cash debt extinguishment costs 1 Cash debt extinguishment costs 3 Total interest expense 59 48 156 142 
 _________ 
 (1) Including the change in accrued interest, total cash interest paid was 40 million and 39 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 131 million and 129 million year-to-date 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other gains . Other gains in 2023 reflected the gain on sale of The Camby, Autograph Collection. 
 Equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates . Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 6 million and 5 million for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, primarily due to earnings from our investment in the Noble joint venture. 
 Provision for income taxes. We lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the TRS primarily represents hotel-level operations, net of the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. For the third quarter and year-to-date of 2024, we recorded a net income tax provision of 6 million and 20 million, respectively, due primarily to the profitability of hotel operations retained by the TRS. 
 
 Comparable Hotel RevPAR Overview 
 We discuss operating results for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis. Comparable hotels are those properties that we consolidate as of the reporting date. Comparable hotels do not include the results of hotels sold or classified as held-for-sale, hotels that have sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or hotels that have undergone large-scale capital projects, in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer during the reporting periods being compared. See Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results below for more information on how we determine our comparable hotels. Beginning in third quarter of 2024, we have separated the Oahu and Maui markets. 
 We also include, following the comparable hotels results by geographic location, the same operating statistics presentation on an actual basis, which includes results for our portfolio for the time period of our ownership, including the 
 
 30 

results of non-comparable properties, dispositions through their date of disposal and acquisitions beginning as of the date of acquisition. Lastly, we discuss our hotel results by mix of business (i.e., transient, group, or contract).

 Hotel Business Mix 
 Our customers fall into three broad categories: transient, group, and contract business, which accounted for approximately 61 , 35 , and 4 , respectively, of our full year 2023 room sales. The information below is derived from business mix results from the 79 comparable hotels owned as of September 30, 2024. For additional detail on our business mix, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10 K. 
 For the third quarter and year-to-date, group revenue increased by 1.0 and 5.3 , respectively, compared to 2023, driven by a 1.1 and 2.7 increase in average rate, respectively, as our convention and downtown properties continued to benefit from group demand. The minimal 0.2 increase for the third quarter and 2.9 decrease year-to-date in transient revenue reflects the impacts of moderating leisure demand and the slow, yet improving, recovery in Maui.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. The liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of OP units or the sale of hotels. Host Inc. is a REIT, and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for common and preferred OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P. 
 Overview. We look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt, and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. We believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and positioning us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. We have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of hotels that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Currently, only one of our consolidated hotels is encumbered by mortgage debt. Over the past several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result, we were well positioned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in U.S. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. We intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund, and believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund, corporate expenses, capital expenditures, hotel acquisitions and dividends and remain well positioned to execute additional investment transactions to the extent opportunities arise. 
 Cash Requirements. We use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, and corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and to OP unitholders, respectively, and stock and OP unit repurchases. As a REIT, Host Inc. is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. Our next significant debt maturity is 500 million of senior notes due in June 2025. 
 Capital Resources. As of September 30, 2024, we had 564 million of cash and cash equivalents, 240 million in our FF E escrow reserves and 1.5 billion available under the revolver portion of our credit facility. We depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Our financial flexibility, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments, is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes indentures, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges.

Two programs are currently in place relating to potential purchases or sales of our common stock. Under our common stock repurchase program, common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. During the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of Host Inc. common stock at an average price of 16.33 per share, exclusive of commissions, through our common share repurchase program for a total of 57 million. At September 30, 2024, we had 685 million available for repurchase under our program. 
 In addition, on May 31, 2023, we entered into a distribution agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents pursuant to which Host Inc. may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of Host Inc. common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 600 million. The sales will be made in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings under the SEC rules. We may sell shares of Host Inc. common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions, although we are not under an obligation to sell any shares. The agreement also contemplates that, in addition to the offering and sale of shares to or through the sales agents, we may enter into separate forward sale agreements with each of the forward purchasers named in the agreement. No shares were issued during the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there was 600 million of remaining capacity under the agreement. 
 Given the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we may continue to redeem or repurchase senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. In February 2023, Host Inc. s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to 1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. We may purchase senior notes with cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer, or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of previously deferred and capitalized financing costs. Accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile, and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws and the requirements of our credit facility and senior notes indentures, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of our common stock. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously. 
 We continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. We anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of hotels, but also potentially from equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., or available cash. Given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. We may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash. Our sources of cash generally include cash from operations, proceeds from debt and equity issuances, and proceeds from hotel sales. Uses of cash include acquisitions, capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, and repurchases of shares and distributions to equity holders. 
 Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Year-to-date in 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 1,167 million compared to 1,134 million for year-to-date in 2023, an increase reflecting the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed for the first half of 2023, as well as operations from our 2024 Acquisitions. 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was 1,851 million year-to-date in 2024 compared to 263 million year-to-date in 2023. Cash used in investing activities year-to-date in 2024 and 2023 primarily related to 375 million and 472 million of capital expenditures, respectively, investments in our joint ventures, and the acquisition of four hotels in 2024. Cash provided by investing activities in 2023 included proceeds from the repayment of a 
 
 36 

note receivable and the sale of The Camby, Autograph Collection, with proceeds of 34 million, which is net of a 72 million loan issued to the buyer in connection with the sale.

 Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. Year-to-date in 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 129 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 606 million for year-to-date in 2023. Cash provided by financing activities in 2024 included proceeds from the issuances of senior notes. Cash used in financing activities in both 2024 and 2023 primarily related to the payment of common stock dividends and common stock repurchases, while 2024 also included the repayment of senior notes.

 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total debt was 5.1 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8 and a weighted average maturity of 5.5 years. Additionally, 80 of our debt has a fixed rate of interest, and only one of our consolidated hotels is encumbered by mortgage debt. 
 Senior Notes. On August 12, 2024, Host L.P. issued 700 million of 5.500 Series L senior notes in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of approximately 683 million, net of original issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series L senior notes are due in April 2035 and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2025. The net proceeds were used in part to repay all 525 million of borrowings then outstanding under the revolver portion of our senior credit facility, including amounts borrowed in connection with the recent acquisitions of The Ritz-Carlton O ahu, Turtle Bay and 1 Hotel Central Park. The Series L senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the April 15, 2035 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series L senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes. 
 
 Financial Covenants 
 Credit Facility Covenants. Our credit facility contains certain important financial covenants concerning allowable leverage, unsecured interest coverage, and required fixed charge coverage. Total debt used in the calculation of our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (our Leverage Ratio is based on a net debt concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of 100 million are deducted from our total debt balance for purposes of measuring compliance. 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility. The following table summarizes the results of the financial tests required by the credit facility, which are calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis: 
 Actual Ratio Covenant Requirement for all years Leverage ratio 2.7x Maximum ratio of 7.25x Fixed charge coverage ratio 5.5x Minimum ratio of 1.25x Unsecured interest coverage ratio 7.1x Minimum ratio of 1.75x 
 ___________

as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects, in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below), during the reporting periods being compared. 
 We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally, operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale. 
 The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally, hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. 
 Similarly, hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case, these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often, related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel, we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains covering lost revenues while the property was considered non-comparable also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results. 
 Of the 81 hotels that we owned as of September 30, 2024, 79 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of September 30, 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods: 
 Alila Ventana Big Sur (business disruption due to the collapse of a portion of Highway 1, causing closure of the hotel beginning in March 2024, reopened in May 2024); 
 The Ritz-Carlton, Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022, reopened in July 2023); and 
 Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort. 
 Additionally, The Don CeSar closed on September 25, 2024, following a mandatory evacuation order prior to the landfall of Hurricane Helene. The hotel experienced substantial damage from the hurricane and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result, the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the fourth quarter. 
 
 Foreign Currency Translation 
 Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore, hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures include the following: 
 Earnings Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA ), Earnings Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re , as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., 
 Funds From Operations FFO and FFO per diluted share, both calculated in accordance with National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT guidelines and with certain adjustments from those guidelines, as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and 
 
 40 

Comparable hotel operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P. 
 The discussion below defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance. 
 Set forth below for each such non-GAAP financial measure is a reconciliation of the measure with the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable thereto. We also have included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-GAAP Financial Measures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 further explanations of the adjustments being made, a statement disclosing the reasons why we believe the presentation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, the additional purposes for which we use the non-GAAP financial measures and limitations on their use. 
 EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre 
 EBITDA 
 EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs. 
 EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre 
 We present EBITDA re in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate, to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDA re as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity s pro rata share of EBITDA re of unconsolidated affiliates. 
 We make additional adjustments to EBITDA re when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA re , when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA re also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDA re for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA re : 
 Property Insurance Gains We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA re is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets. 
 Acquisition Costs Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company. 
 Litigation Gains and Losses We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. 
 
 41 

Severance Expense In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. 
 In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDA re for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re to net income, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider the most directly comparable:

 (1) Reflects the sale of one hotel in 2023. 
 (2) Unrealized gains of our unconsolidated investments are not recognized in our EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA re , NAREIT FFO or Adjusted FFO until they have been realized by the unconsolidated partnership. 
 FFO Measures 
 We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT s Funds From Operations White Paper 2018 Restatement. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis. 
 We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in 
 
 42 

evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share: 
 Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs. 
 Acquisition Costs Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company. 
 Litigation Gains and Losses We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. 
 Severance Expense In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. 
 In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately 11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measures, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable:

 (3) Diluted earnings per common share, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share are adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, preferred OP units held by non-controlling limited partners and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partner interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti-dilutive. 
 Comparable Hotel Property-Level Operating Results 
 We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a comparable hotel, or "same store," basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage, as discussed in Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are 
 
 44 

removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for our properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient. 
 Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance. 
 We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management. 
 The following tables present certain operating results and statistics for our hotels for the periods presented herein and a reconciliation of the differences between comparable Hotel EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, and net income, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable. Similar reconciliations of the differences between (i) hotel revenues and (ii) our revenues as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (each of which is used in the applicable margin calculation), and between (iii) hotel expenses and (iv) operating costs and expenses as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, also are included in the reconciliation:

 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 80 and 76 , respectively, of our outstanding debt bore interest at fixed rates. To manage interest rate risk applicable to our debt, we may enter into interest rate swaps or caps. The interest rate derivatives into which we may enter are strictly to hedge interest rate risk and are not for trading purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we do not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding. 
 See Item 7A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10 K. 
 Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
 As we have operations outside of the United States (specifically, the ownership of hotels in Brazil and Canada and a minority investment in a joint venture in India), currency exchange risks arise in the normal course of our business. To manage the currency exchange risk, we may enter into forward or option contracts or hedge our investment through the issuance of foreign currency denominated debt. During the third quarter of 2024, three foreign currency forward purchase contracts matured, with a total notional amount of CAD 99 million 74 million), and we received 1.4 million in the aggregate upon settlement of these contracts. To replace the maturing contracts, we entered into two new foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a total notional amount of CAD 99 million 73 million), which will mature in August 2025. The foreign currency exchange agreements into which we have entered are strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and are not for trading purposes.

Item 5. 
 , , a of Host Inc., a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c). Under the trading plan, Mr. Rakowich will sell 40 of the shares of Host Inc.'s common stock he receives as part of his annual director stock award following the annual meetings in 2025 and 2026, to the extent he is elected as a director at those meetings. As described in the Company s proxy statement for its annual meeting, non-employee directors receive an annual director stock award effective after election at the annual meeting. Because the number of shares that non-employee directors receive is calculated by dividing a dollar amount 180,000 for 2024) by the share price of Host Inc.'s common stock on the date of the annual meeting, the aggregate number of shares to be sold under the trading plan is not currently ascertainable. However, if we assume the director stock award remains 180,000 in 2025 and 2026, and we estimate using Host Inc.'s closing share price of 17.24 on October 31, 2024, the aggregate number of shares to be sold under the trading plan is estimated to be shares.
