and requires additional funds to support its operations and
to achieve its business development goals, the attainment of which are not assured. 

These
factors and uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might incur in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. Management intends to seek additional capital
from new equity securities offerings, debt financing and debt restructuring to provide funds needed to increase liquidity, fund internal
growth and fully implement its business plan. However, management can give no assurance that these funds will be available in adequate
amounts, or if available, on terms that would be satisfactory to the Company. 

The
timing and amount of the Company s capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including maintaining its status as
a public company and supporting shareholder and investor relations.

General
Background of the Company 

Hallmark
Venture Group, Inc. we , us , our or the Company was originally incorporated
in the State of Colorado on July 14, 1995, with the name CPC Office Systems, Inc. On July 12, 1999, the Company changed its name to Homesmart
USA, Inc. On March 3, 2006, the Company moved its domicile to Nevada. On March 8, 2006, the Company changed its name to Smart Truck Systems,
Inc. On March 6, 2008, the Company changed its name to Speech Phone, Inc. On July 16, 2008, the Company changed its name to Hallmark
Venture Group, Inc. On March 22, 2022, the Company redomiciled and became a Florida corporation. 

On
November 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Plan of Merger and Acquisition Agreement (the Stonecrest Merger Agreement ),
pursuant to which the Company purchased Stonecrest Owner, LLC in exchange for the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000
shares of Series A preferred stock to the members of Stonecrest Owner, LLC. On July 12, 2021, the parties agreed to cancel and unwind
the transactions contemplated by the Stonecrest Merger Agreement. As a result, all of the shares of common stock and preferred stock
that were issued as part of that transaction were canceled. 

On
September 26, 2024, the Company and Jubilee Intel, LLC Jubilee entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
(the Merger whereby the Company acquired 100 membership interests in and to Jubilee in exchange for 100,000 shares of
Series A Preferred Stock. As a result of the Merger, Jubilee has become a wholly owned and operating subsidiary of the Company. The Company
ceased to be a shell company . 

Business
Objectives of the Company 

The
Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Jubilee Intel, LLC utilizes a proprietary Search Engine Marketing (SEM) platform to provide
cutting-edge solutions for managing and scaling SEM campaigns through automation, AI, and machine learning. With access to a direct feed
from Yahoo s partner network and the ability to seamlessly integrate across platforms like Facebook, GDN, and Taboola, our system
is optimized for profitability. 

Our
platform integrates machine learning and AI to automate the entire SEM process, from keyword research to campaign generation and optimization.
This system eliminates the need for manual intervention, drastically reducing the time and resources required for effective SEM management. 

We
utilize a random forest regressor to process and analyze vast amounts of keyword data, often encompassing hundreds of thousands of data
points. A random forest regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It builds multiple decision
trees during training, each using different subsets of the data, and averages the results to make predictions. This approach improves
accuracy and reduces overfitting by leveraging the collective decision-making of several trees, which helps handle the complexity of
large datasets. 

For
predicting profitability based on time-series data, we utilize the Support Vector Regressor (SVR). SVR is a powerful machine learning
model that excels at capturing non-linear relationships in the data. By using a kernel trick, SVR can map input data into higher-dimensional
spaces, allowing it to capture complex patterns and trends in campaign profitability over time. 

To
improve traffic quality and block underperforming sites, we use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier. SVM is a supervised learning
model that finds the optimal boundary between different classes of data points. It is particularly effective in high dimensional spaces
and works well when there s a clear margin of separation between classes. We use SVM to classify traffic sources as good 
or bad based on various engagement and performance metrics. 

All
our reporting is centralized into a unified dashboard that provides real-time insights into campaign performance, keyword effectiveness,
and traffic quality. 

Our
platform stands apart because it seamlessly integrates real-time data, machine learning models, and direct feeds from top-tier search
engines. Unlike many platforms that require manual adjustments, our system automates every aspect of campaign creation, optimization,
and scaling, resulting in significant efficiency gains and performance improvements for our clients. 

The
Company is obligated to file interim and periodic reports including an annual report with audited financial statements. This obligation
will substantially increase the expenses incurred by the Company. 

The
Company s common stock is subject to quotation on the OTC Markets Group Inc. Pink Market OTC Pink under the symbol
HLLK. There is currently only a limited trading market in the Company s common stock. There can be no assurance that there will
be an active trading market for our common stock. If an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price
of our common stock, whether the trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.

Implications
of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company as defined under the Securities Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend
to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include,
but are not limited to: 

not
 being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (or
 the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); 

reduced
 disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 

exemptions
 from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute
 payments not previously approved. 

In
addition, an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards
would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period. We will remain an
emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (i) our reporting 1.07 billion or more in annual gross revenues; (ii) the end
of fiscal year 2024; (iii) our issuance, in a three year period, of more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the end of
the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700 million on the last business day of
our second fiscal quarter.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Each
of our principal executive and principal financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on their evaluation, each such person concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to a lack of segregation of duties. 

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Our
management has evaluated whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter.
Based on that evaluation, management concluded that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during
the relevant period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
