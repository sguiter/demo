our expectations regarding the development and commercialization of product candidates currently being developed by third parties that utilize our technology; 

our anticipated growth strategies; 

our expectations regarding competition; 

the anticipated trends and challenges in our business and the market in which we operate;

our expectations regarding the outcome of legal proceedings;

million. The Company's ability to transition to recurring profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support its cost structure, which depends heavily on the successful development, approval and commercialization of its product candidates. The Company may never achieve recurring profitability, and unless and until it does, will continue to need to raise additional capital through equity offerings, licensing and collaboration arrangements, or other non-dilutive financings. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient capital or obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise capital sufficient to meet its working capital needs in the future, it may be forced to delay expenditures, reduce the scope of its development activities or make other changes to its operating plans. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of million, which management believes is sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months from the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , available-for-sale debt securities had remaining maturities greater than three years. The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or to the earliest call date for callable debt securities purchased at a premium. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted solely of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net of reclassification adjustments for realized gains and losses and income tax effects. The Company uses the aggregate portfolio approach to release the tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Realized gains and losses from the sale or maturity of marketable securities are based on the specific identification method and are included in results of operations as investment income. The Company did t recognize any realized gains or losses on available-for-sales securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and income tax effects or reclassification adjustments were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss during the periods.

Management estimates that the carrying values of its current accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments. Accounts receivable which contain non-current portions and certain non-current payables reported as other liabilities are recorded at their present values using a discount rate that is based on prevailing market rates on the date the amounts were initially recorded. Management does not believe there have been any significant changes in market conditions or credit quality that would cause the discount rates initially used to be materially different from those that would be used as of September 30, 2024 to determine the present value of these instruments. Accordingly, management estimates that the carrying values of its non-current accounts receivable and other liabilities approximate the fair value of those instruments. Management estimates that the carrying value of the liability related to the sale of future royalties approximates fair value. As discussed in Note 7, the carrying value of the liability related to the sale of future royalties is based on the Company s estimate of future royalties expected to be paid by the Company over the life of the arrangement, which are considered Level 3 inputs. Long-lived assets, if determined to be not recoverable and impaired, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs. Please refer to Note 6 for further information on nonrecurring fair value measurements of long-lived assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

In March 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sublease its office facilities in New York, New York. In connection with the sublease, the Company recorded impairment of property and equipment of million in the first quarter of 2024 related to furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements located at the subleased facility. Please refer to Note 6 for further information regarding the sublease agreement and associated impairment of long-lived assets. 

 million. The Company recognized sublease income of million and million under the New York Sublease during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The New York Sublease is classified as an operating lease and the Company was not relieved of its primary obligation under the New York Lease. The Company continues to account for the New York Lease as it did prior to the commencement of the sublease. As a result of the New York Sublease, the Company determined an impairment indicator was present as of March 31, 2024 related to the long-lived asset group subject to the sublease, which included the right-of-use asset under the New York Lease, leasehold improvements and other property and equipment allocable to the New York Sublease. The Company concluded the carrying value of the asset group as of March 31, 2024 was not recoverable, as it exceeded the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets over their remaining lives. The Company estimated the fair value of the asset group as of March 31, 2024 using a discounted cash flow method, which incorporated unobservable inputs including the net identifiable cash flows over the term of the New York Sublease and an estimated borrowing rate of a market participant subtenant. The estimated fair value of the asset group as of March 31, 2024 represents a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. The Company concluded the carrying value of the asset group of million exceeded its estimated fair value of million as of March 31, 2024. As such, the Company recognized impairment losses of million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on the long-lived asset group associated with the New York Sublease.

million of royalty payments received by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2020 (the Pledged Royalties). In consideration for these rights, HCR paid the Company million (the Purchase Price), less 4.0 million representing the payment of the Pledged Royalties to HCR. Beginning upon the effective date of the Royalty Purchase Agreement, Zolgensma royalty payments, up to a specified threshold, shall be paid to HCR, net of upstream royalties payable by the Company to certain licensors in accordance with existing license agreements. Pursuant to the Royalty Purchase Agreement, the total amount of royalty payments to be received by HCR is subject to an increasing cap (the Cap Amount) equal to (i) million applicable for the period from the effective date of the Royalty Purchase Agreement through November 7, 2024, and (ii) million applicable for the period from November 8, 2024 through the effective date of termination of the Novartis License. If, on or prior to the defined dates for each Cap Amount, the total amount of royalty payments received by HCR equals or exceeds the Cap Amount applicable to such date, the Royalty Purchase Agreement will automatically terminate and all rights to the Zolgensma royalty payments will revert back to the Company. The Company has no obligation to repay any amounts to HCR if total future Zolgensma royalty payments are not sufficient to achieve the applicable Cap Amount prior to the termination of the Novartis License. The Company has a call option to repurchase its rights to the purchased royalties from HCR for a repurchase price equal to, as of the option exercise date, million minus the total amount of royalty payments received by HCR; provided, however, that with respect to a call option exercised on or before November 7, 2024, in the event that the then applicable Cap Amount minus the total amount of royalty payments received by HCR is less than million, the repurchase price shall equal such difference. The proceeds received from HCR of million were recorded as a liability, net of transaction costs of million, which is amortized over the estimated life of the arrangement using the effective interest method. In order to determine the amortization of the liability, the Company is required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received by HCR, subject to the Cap Amount, over the life of the arrangement. The total amount of royalty payments received by HCR under the Royalty Purchase Agreement, less the net proceeds received by the Company of million, is recorded as interest expense over the life of the arrangement using the effective interest method. Due to its continuing involvement in the Novartis License, the Company continues to recognize royalty revenue on net sales of Zolgensma and records the royalty payments to HCR as a reduction of the liability when paid. As such payments are made to HCR, the balance of the liability will be effectively repaid over the life of the Royalty Purchase Agreement. The Company estimates the effective interest rate used to record interest expense under the Royalty Purchase Agreement based on its estimate of future royalty payments to be received by HCR. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated effective interest rate under the Royalty Purchase Agreement was . Over the life of the arrangement, the actual effective interest rate will be affected by the amount and timing of the royalty payments received by HCR and changes in the Company s forecasted royalties. At each reporting date, the Company reassesses its estimate of total future royalty payments to be received by HCR at the applicable Cap Amount, and prospectively adjusts the effective interest rate and amortization of the liability, as necessary.

shares of its common stock at a price of per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of its common stock at a price of per pre-funded warrant, which equaled the public offering price per share of the common stock less the exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the offering were million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. The rights and privileges of the pre-funded warrants issued under the March 2024 offering are set forth in the warrant agreement between the Company and each of the respective warrant holders. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable at the option of the warrant holder at any time and do not expire. However, as set forth in the warrant agreements with each holder, the number of pre-funded warrants that may be exercised at any given time may be limited if, upon exercise, the warrant holder and any of its affiliates would beneficially own more than of the Company s common stock, or have voting power of more than of the Company's common stock. The limitation threshold may be increased or decreased by the warrant holder, with advance notice to the Company, to any other percentage not less than nor in excess of . Pre-funded warrants do not provide any of the rights or privileges provided by the Company's common stock, including any voting rights, until the pre-funded warrants are exercised and settled in underlying shares of common stock. The Company evaluated the pre-funded warrants issued under the March 2024 offering and concluded the warrants are indexed to the Company's common stock, meet the criteria to be classified as equity and are not subject to remeasurement. The proceeds received from the issuance of the pre-funded warrants were recorded as additional paid-in capital. The Company issued shares of common stock upon the exercise of pre-funded warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were exercises of pre-funded warrants during the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, pre-funded warrants remained outstanding. At-the-Market Offering Program In September 2023, the Company entered into an ATM Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. (BofA) pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through BofA, acting as the Company's sales agent (the ATM Program). As of September 30 , 2024 , shares of common stock had been sold under the ATM Program.

million and million, respectively, from Novartis Gene Therapies under the Novartis License, which consisted primarily of Zolgensma royalties receivable. The Zolgensma royalties receivable recorded as of September 30, 2024 included million expected to be paid to HCR in accordance with the Royalty Purchase Agreement discussed in Note 7. The Company recognizes royalty revenue from net sales of Zolgensma in the period in which the underlying products are sold by Novartis Gene Therapies, which in certain cases may require the Company to estimate royalty revenue for periods of net sales which have not yet been reported to the Company. Estimated royalties are reconciled to actual amounts reported in subsequent periods, and any differences are recognized as an adjustment to royalty revenue in the period the royalties are reported. Settlement Agreement with Abeona Therapeutics In November 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Abeona (the Settlement Agreement) related to claims associated with a license agreement between the parties which was terminated in May 2020. The Settlement Agreement resolved all arbitration and legal proceedings and mutually released each party from any and all claims under the terminated license agreement. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Abeona will pay the Company a total of million as follows: (i) million which was paid in November 2021, (ii) million which was paid in November 2022, and (iii) million payable on the earlier of the third anniversary of the Settlement Agreement in November 2024 or the closing of a specified type of transaction by Abeona. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had recorded accounts receivable of million and million, respectively, associated with the remaining amounts due from Abeona under the Settlement Agreement. The receivable of million as of September 30, 2024 consisted of the million payment due by November 2024, net of discount to present value. While the Company anticipates taking appropriate measures to enforce the full collection of all amounts due from Abeona under the Settlement Agreement, the Company assessed the collectability of the accounts receivable from Abeona as it relates to credit risk. In performing this assessment, the Company evaluated Abeona s credit profile and financial condition, as well its expectations regarding Abeona s future cash flows and ability to satisfy the contractual obligations of the Settlement Agreement. As a result of its analysis, the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to the accounts receivable due from Abeona. credit losses or recoveries were recorded on the Abeona receivable during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The present value discount of the Abeona receivable is accreted as interest income from licensing through the contractual due date using the effective interest method. The Company has elected to record increases in the allowance for credit losses associated with the accretion of the present value discount as a reduction of the associated interest income, resulting in no interest income recognized during the periods related to the accretion of the present value discount on the Abeona receivable. Collaboration Agreements AbbVie Collaboration and License Agreement In September 2021, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement with AbbVie Global Enterprises Ltd. (AbbVie), a subsidiary of AbbVie Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize ABBV-RGX-314, the Company s product candidate for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and other chronic retinal diseases (the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement).

In addition, you should read the Risk Factors and Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Overview 
 We are a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. Our investigational gene therapies are designed to deliver functional genes to address genetic defects in cells, enabling the production of therapeutic proteins or antibodies that are intended to impact disease. Through a single administration, gene therapy could potentially alter the course of disease significantly and deliver improved patient outcomes with long-lasting effects. 
 Overview of Product Candidates 
 We have developed a broad pipeline of gene therapy programs using our proprietary adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy delivery platform (NAV Technology Platform) as a one-time treatment to address an array of diseases. Our lead programs and product candidates are described below: 
 ABBV-RGX-314: We are developing ABBV-RGX-314 in collaboration with AbbVie as a potential one-time treatment for chronic retinal conditions which cause total or partial vision loss, including wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). ABBV-RGX-314 is currently being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical trials, including two pivotal trials (ATMOSPHERE and ASCENT), one Phase II bridging study, one long-term follow-up study, and a fellow eye treatment study in patients with wet AMD, all utilizing subretinal delivery. Additionally, two Phase II clinical trials in patients with wet AMD (AAVIATE) and DR (ALTITUDE) are ongoing along with two corresponding long-term follow-up studies, all utilizing in-office suprachoroidal delivery. Within the Phase II study in DR, we are also evaluating ABBV-RGX-314 in diabetic macular edema (DME). ABBV-RGX-314 uses the NAV AAV8 vector to deliver a gene encoding a therapeutic antibody fragment to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We have licensed certain exclusive rights to the SCS Microinjector from Clearside Biomedical, Inc. (Clearside) to deliver gene therapy treatments to the suprachoroidal space of the eye. 

Wet AMD 
 Subretinal Delivery 
 Enrollment continues to be on track in the ATMOSPHERE and ASCENT pivotal trials for the treatment of patients with wet AMD using subretinal delivery. These trials are expected to support global regulatory submissions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first half of 2026. In October 2024, we reported positive data from a Phase II fellow eye sub-study at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2024 annual meeting. The sub-study evaluated subretinal delivery of ABBV-RGX-314 in patients who received ABBV-RGX-314 in the Phase I/IIa or bridging studies and elected to receive treatment in their second eye. As of September 11, 2024, ABBV-RGX-314 was well tolerated in the treated fellow eye, with no drug-related serious adverse events and no cases of intraocular inflammation observed. At nine months post-administration, patients saw a 97 reduction in anti-VEGF treatment burden and sustained vision and anatomy. These data demonstrate the potential of ABBV-RGX-314 to preserve vision long-term for patients with wet AMD as a one-time treatment for both eyes. Bilateral disease impacts a significant number of patients with wet AMD. 
 Suprachoroidal Delivery 
 The AAVIATE trial is a multi-center, open label, randomized, controlled, dose-escalation Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of suprachoroidal delivery of ABBV-RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD. As of July 29, 2024, ABBV-RGX-314 at dose level 3 with short course prophylactic steroid eye drops continues to be well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no cases of intraocular inflammation, endophthalmitis, vasculitis, retinal artery occlusion, choroidal effusion, or hypotony. Mild episcleritis occurred in three patients, all resolved and completed treatment with topical steroids. There were no cases of elevated intraocular pressure. Based on this favorable safety profile, the Phase II AAVIATE trial is initiating enrollment in a new cohort to evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 at dose level 4 (1.5x10e12 GC/eye). Patients in this cohort will also receive short course prophylactic steroid eye drops.

Table of Contents 

DR and DME 
 The ALTITUDE trial is a multi-center, open label, randomized, controlled, dose-escalation Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ABBV-RGX-314 using suprachoroidal delivery for the treatment of DR. Based on positive interim results from this trial, we and AbbVie have accelerated a planned End-of-Phase II (EOP2) meeting with the FDA expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect to initiate the first global pivotal trial in the first half of 2025. 
 The ALTITUDE trial is now enrolling a new cohort of patients with center-involved DME. DME is a vision-threatening complication of DR; an estimated 34 million people globally have DME. Patients will receive a one-time, in-office injection of ABBV-RGX-314 at dose level 4 (1.5x10e12 GC/eye) with short course prophylactic steroid eye drops. 
 RGX-202: We are developing RGX-202 as an investigational one-time AAV therapeutic for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne), using the NAV AAV8 vector to deliver a transgene for a novel microdystrophin that includes the functional elements of the C-Terminal (CT) domain as well as a muscle-specific promoter to support a targeted therapy for improved resistance to muscle damage associated with Duchenne. 

AFFINITY DUCHENNE is a Phase I/II multicenter, open-label dose escalation and dose expansion clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a one-time intravenous (IV) dose of RGX-202 in patients with Duchenne aged 1 to 11 years old. In March 2024 and May 2024, we reported interim safety and efficacy data from the trial, including RGX-202 microdystrophin expression for the first two patients who received RGX-202 at dose level 2 (DL2). 
 In August 2024, we announced new data from two patients, aged 5.8 and 8.5 years, who received RGX-202 at DL2. RGX-202 microdystrophin expression in these patients was measured to be 77.2 and 46.5 , respectively, compared to control at three months. As of July 8, 2024, RGX-202 has been well tolerated with no SAEs. Data from all seven patients who completed three-month trial assessments indicate meaningful increases in expression of RGX-202 microdystrophin and reduction from baseline in serum creatinine kinase levels, supporting evidence of clinical improvement. 
 In November 2024, we announced that the last patient has been dosed in the dose level 2 (pivotal dose) expansion cohort for ages 4 to 11 years old and the first patient has been dosed in the cohort for ages 1 to 3 years old. A clinical trial application for RGX-202 has been authorized by Health Canada, and we expect to initiate sites in Canada in the first half of 2025. 
 Following a successful EOP2 meeting with the FDA earlier this year, we plan to share a full program update in November 2024, including pivotal trial design and plans for accelerated approval, as well as initial strength and functional assessment data for both dose levels of the AFFINITY DUCHENNE trial. 
 RGX-202 is manufactured using our proprietary, high-yielding NAVXpress platform process. This suspension-based manufacturing process has demonstrated scalability up to 2,000 liters with consistent yield and product purity. Our Manufacturing Innovation Center has the capacity and yields to produce up to 2,500 doses of RGX-202 per year to support future commercialization. 
 RGX-121: We are developing RGX-121 as an investigational one-time AAV therapeutic for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome, using the NAV AAV9 vector to deliver the gene that encodes the iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme. 

CAMPSIITE is a Phase I/II/III multi-center, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of RGX-121 in patients with MPS II aged 4 months up to 5 years old. We continue to follow patients in the trial and, in February 2024, reported that the pivotal phase of the CAMPSIITE trial achieved its primary endpoint, a reduction in cerebrospinal fluid Heparan sulfate levels of D2S6, a biomarker indicative of brain disease activity, with statistical significance. In September 2024, we announced positive data from the pivotal dose level of RGX-121 demonstrating long-term systemic effect. We plan to use levels of cerebrospinal fluid Heparan sulfate D2S6 as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit for accelerated approval and have initiated a rolling biologics license application (BLA) submission using the accelerated approval pathway. The BLA submission is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2025. 
 We believe that RGX-121 is likely to be eligible for priority review, especially if no other gene therapy product for MPS II is approved before submission of a BLA for RGX-121, and potential approval of the Company's planned BLA for RGX-121 could result in receipt of a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher in 2025, assuming the statutory criteria are met, potentially making RGX-121 the first approved gene therapy and one-time treatment for MPS II.

Overview of Our NAV Technology Platform 
 In addition to our internal product development efforts, we also selectively license the NAV Technology Platform and other intellectual property rights to other leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, which we refer to as NAV Technology Licensees. As of September 30, 2024, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in one commercial product, Zolgensma , and the preclinical and clinical development of a number of other licensed products. Licensing the NAV Technology Platform allows us to maintain our internal product development focus on our core disease indications and therapeutic areas while still expanding the NAV gene therapy pipeline, developing a greater breadth of treatments for patients, providing additional technological and potential clinical proof-of-concept for our NAV Technology Platform and creating potential additional revenue opportunities. 
 Financial Overview 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues to date consist primarily of license and royalty revenue resulting from the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform and other intellectual property rights. We have not generated any revenues from commercial sales of our own products. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval and adequate labeling, our ability to generate future revenues will be materially compromised. 
 We license our NAV Technology Platform and other intellectual property rights to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including collaborators for the joint development and commercialization of our product candidates. The terms of the licenses vary, and licenses may be exclusive or non-exclusive and may be sublicensable by the licensee. Licenses may grant intellectual property rights for purposes of internal and preclinical research and development only, or may include the rights, or options to obtain future rights, to commercialize drug therapies for specific diseases using the NAV Technology Platform and other licensed rights. License agreements generally have a term at least equal to the life of the underlying patents, but are terminable at the option of the licensee. Consideration from licensees under our license agreements may include: (i) up-front and annual fees, (ii) milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones, (iii) sublicense fees, (iv) royalties on sales of licensed products, (v) fees for services related to the development of licensed products and (vi) other consideration payable upon optional goods and services purchased by licensees. 
 Future license and royalty revenues are dependent on the successful development and commercialization of licensed products, which is uncertain, and revenues may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Additionally, we may never receive consideration in our license agreements that is contemplated on option fees, development and sales-based milestone payments, royalties on sales of licensed products or sublicense fees, given the contingent nature of these payments. Our revenues are concentrated among a low number of licensees and licenses are terminable at the option of the licensee. The termination of our licenses by licensees may materially impact the amount of revenue we recognize in future periods. 
 Zolgensma Royalties 
 Royalty revenue to date consists primarily of royalties on net sales of Zolgensma, which is marketed by Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc. (formerly AveXis, Inc.) (Novartis Gene Therapies), a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis AG (Novartis), for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Zolgensma is a licensed product under our license agreement with Novartis Gene Therapies for the development and commercialization of treatments for SMA using the NAV Technology Platform. 
 Collaboration and License Agreement with AbbVie 
 In September 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with AbbVie Global Enterprises Ltd. (AbbVie), a subsidiary of AbbVie Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize ABBV-RGX-314 (the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement). The AbbVie Collaboration Agreement may materially impact our future revenues, research and development expenses, other operating expenses and operating cash flows associated with the development and commercialization of ABBV-RGX-314. For additional information regarding the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, please refer to Note 9, License and Collaboration Agreements AbbVie Collaboration and License Agreement to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist primarily of cost of revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs including salaries, wages, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We allocate indirect expenses associated with our facilities, information technology costs, depreciation and other overhead costs between research and development and general and administrative categories based on employee headcount and the nature of work performed by each employee or using other reasonable allocation methodologies. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Our cost of revenues consists primarily of upstream fees due to our licensors as a result of revenue generated from the licensing of our NAV Technology Platform and other intellectual property rights, including sublicense fees and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Sublicense fees are based on a percentage of license fees received by us from licensees and are recognized in the period that the underlying license revenue is recognized. Royalties are based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products by licensees and are recognized in the period that the underlying sales occur. Future costs of revenues are uncertain due to the nature of our license agreements and significant fluctuations in cost of revenues may occur from period to period. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Our research and development expenses consist primarily of: 
 salaries, wages and personnel-related costs, including benefits, travel and stock-based compensation, for our scientific personnel and others performing research and development activities; 

costs related to executing preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

costs related to acquiring, developing and manufacturing materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

fees paid to consultants and other third-parties who support our product candidate development; 

other costs in seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates; and 

direct costs and allocated costs related to laboratories and facilities, depreciation expense, information technology and other overhead. 

Up-front fees incurred in obtaining technology licenses for research and development activities, as well as associated milestone payments, are charged to research and development expense as incurred if the technology licensed has no alternative future use. 
 We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates and engage in early research and development for prospective product candidates and new technologies. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Direct expenses related to the development of ABBV-RGX-314 include net cost reimbursement from AbbVie under our eye care collaboration of 20.1 million and 66.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 19.6 million and 56.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which were recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses. Net cost reimbursement from AbbVie includes reimbursement of personnel and overhead costs attributable to the development of ABBV-RGX-314, the underlying costs of which are reported as unallocated expenses in the table above. We typically utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. As a result, we generally do not allocate personnel and other internal costs, such as facilities and other overhead costs, to specific product candidates or development programs. 
 Platform and new technologies reported in the table above include direct costs not identifiable with a specific lead product candidate, including costs associated with our research and development platform used across programs, process development, manufacturing analytics and early research and development for prospective product candidates and new technologies. 
 Direct expenses related to the development of product candidates for which we have discontinued internal development are included in other product candidates in the table above. We expect to continue to incur minor development expenses associated with long-term follow up studies for certain discontinued product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages and personnel-related costs, including benefits, travel and stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes certain personnel in executive, commercial, corporate development, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, facilities and administrative support functions. Additionally, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with accounting, legal, commercial and other corporate advisory services, obtaining and maintaining patents, insurance, information systems and other general corporate activities, as well as facility-related costs and other corporate overhead costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to develop, and potentially commercialize, our product candidates. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest Income from Licensing 
 In accordance with our revenue recognition policy, interest income from licensing consists of imputed interest recognized from significant financing components identified in our license agreements with NAV Technology Licensees as well as interest income accrued on unpaid balances due from licensees. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income consists of interest income earned and gains and losses realized from our cash equivalents, marketable securities and non-marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market mutual funds and highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at acquisition. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale debt securities. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest imputed on the liability related to the sale of future Zolgensma royalties to entities managed by Healthcare Royalty Management, LLC (collectively, HCR). Interest expense is recognized using the effective interest method, based on our estimate of total royalty payments expected to be received by HCR under the royalty purchase agreement. For further information regarding the royalty purchase agreement with HCR, please refer to Note 7, Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities

for the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and other reported amounts, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 2 to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 License and Royalty Revenue. License and royalty revenue decreased by 4.7 million, from 28.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to Zolgensma royalty revenues, which decreased from 28.4 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 23.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. As reported by Novartis, sales of Zolgensma for the third quarter of 2024 were 308 million, consistent with sales for the third quarter of 2023, and the product continues to treat mainly incident patients in established markets, translating into stable sales for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in Zolgensma royalties was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the effective royalty rate under the license agreement with Novartis. 
 Research and Development Expense. Research and development expenses decreased by 3.8 million, from 58.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 54.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the following: 
 a decrease of 3.0 million in personnel-related costs for research and development personnel, including a 0.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, largely driven by the reduction in workforce associated with our corporate restructuring implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023; 

a decrease of 2.4 million in preclinical activities and other early-stage research and development; 

a decrease of 1.9 million in costs for laboratories and facilities used by research and development personnel, including a 0.4 million decrease in depreciation expense allocated to research and development functions, primarily driven by a decrease in laboratory supplies and consumables; and 

a decrease of 1.6 million in manufacturing expenses and other costs of clinical supply for our lead product candidates. 

30 

Table of Contents 

The decrease in research and development expenses was partially offset by an increase of 5.8 million in costs associated with clinical trial activities, largely driven by clinical trial expenses for ABBV-RGX-314 and RGX-202. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses decreased by 3.7 million, from 23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 19.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to professional services and consulting fees, including legal and other corporate advisory services. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 License and Royalty Revenue. License and royalty revenue decreased by 5.9 million, from 68.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 62.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to non-recurring development milestone revenue recognized in the first nine months of 2023 and Zolgensma royalty revenues, which decreased from 63.5 million for the first nine months of 2023 to 60.8 million for the first nine months of 2024. As reported by Novartis, sales of Zolgensma for the first nine months of 2024 were 952 million, an increase of 3 from the first nine months of 2023, and the product continues to treat mainly incident patients in established markets. The decrease in Zolgensma royalties was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the effective royalty rate under the license agreement with Novartis. 
 Research and Development Expense. Research and development expenses decreased by 18.4 million, from 176.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 158.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the following: 
 a decrease of 13.4 million in manufacturing expenses and other costs of clinical supply for our lead product candidates, largely driven by ABBV-RGX-314 and RGX-202 clinical supply costs; 

a decrease of 9.4 million in personnel-related costs for research and development personnel, including a 2.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, largely driven by the reduction in workforce associated with our corporate restructuring implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023; 

a decrease of 6.1 million in costs for laboratories and facilities used by research and development personnel, including a 0.8 million decrease in depreciation expense allocated to research and development functions, primarily driven by a decrease in laboratory supplies and consumables; and 

a decrease of 5.5 million in preclinical activities and other early-stage research and development. 

The decrease in research and development expenses was partially offset by an increase of 17.5 million in costs associated with clinical trial activities, largely driven by clinical trial expenses for ABBV-RGX-314 and RGX-202. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses decreased by 12.8 million, from 69.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 56.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the following: 
 a decrease of 10.3 million in professional services and consulting fees, including legal and other corporate advisory services; and 

a decrease of 1.4 million in personnel-related costs for general and administrative personnel, including a 0.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, largely driven by the reduction in workforce associated with our corporate restructuring implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 278.6 million, which were primarily derived from the sale of our common stock and pre-funded warrants described below and license fees received under the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements, and are sufficient to meet our financial commitments and obligations, for at least the next 12 months from the date of this report based on our current business plan. 
 In March 2024, we completed a public offering of 4,565,260 shares of our common stock at a price of 23.00 per share and 1,521,740 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at a price of 22.9999 per pre-funded warrant, which equaled 
 31 

Table of Contents 

the public offering price per share of the common stock less the 0.0001 exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. The aggregate net proceeds received from the offering were 131.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 We intend to devote the majority of our current capital to preclinical research, clinical development, seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates, as well as additional capital expenditures needed to support these activities. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of gene therapy product candidates, we are unable to estimate the total amount of operating expenditures and capital outlays necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. While we expect the pipeline prioritization and corporate restructuring implemented in November 2023 to result in cost savings, we may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the restructuring. In addition, we may not achieve the expected benefits of any cost reduction measures on our currently anticipated timeline, or at all. Furthermore, our estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect which could accelerate our liquidity needs. 
 At-the-Market Offering Program 
 In September 2023, we entered into an ATM Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. (BofA) pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 150.0 million from time to time through BofA, acting as our sales agent (the ATM Program). We intend to use proceeds obtained from the sale of shares under the ATM Program, if any, for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, no shares of common stock had been sold under the ATM Program.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 36.1 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely as a result of lower operating expenses and increased cost reimbursement received from AbbVie under our ABBV-RGX-314 collaboration in the first nine months of 2024. We expect to continue to incur regular net cash outflows from operations for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and advancement of our product candidates and other research programs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in operating activities of 141.5 million consisted of a net loss of 175.9 million and unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of 6.1 million, offset by adjustments for non-cash items of 40.5 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities include a decrease in total accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities of 7.5 million, which was driven largely by decreases in accrued personnel costs, sublicense fees payable to licensors and amounts payable to suppliers as of the end of the period. Other changes in operating working capital occurred in the normal course of business. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of 28.9 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 12.2 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash used in operating activities of 177.6 million consisted of a net loss of 200.6 million and unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of 20.1 million, offset by adjustments for non-cash items of 43.1 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities include an increase in other current assets of 13.6 million, which was driven primarily by an increase in net cost reimbursement due from AbbVie under our ABBV-RGX-314 collaboration, and a decrease in total accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 5.6 million, which was driven primarily by a decrease in amounts payable to suppliers as of the end of the period. Other changes in operating working capital occurred in the normal course of business. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of 31.9 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 13.0 million.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by investing activities consisted of 238.4 million in maturities of marketable debt securities, offset by 173.9 million used to purchase marketable debt securities and 1.4 million used to purchase property and equipment. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash provided by investing activities consisted of 231.8 million in maturities of marketable debt securities and 2.0 million in proceeds received from uniQure N.V. (uniQure) in connection with the achievement of milestones associated with their acquisition of Corlieve Therapeutics SAS (Corlieve), offset by 67.9 million used to purchase marketable debt securities and 8.8 million used to purchase property and equipment. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of 131.1 million in net proceeds received from the public offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants completed in March 2024, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses paid during the period, and 2.7 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. Our net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by 32.2 million of Zolgensma royalties paid, net of imputed interest, under our royalty purchase agreement with HCR. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of 30.5 million of Zolgensma royalties paid, net of imputed interest, under our royalty purchase agreement with HCR. Our net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by 4.9 million in net proceeds received from a private placement of our common stock in July 2023 and 3.1 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. 
 Additional Capital Requirements 
 Our material capital requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to vendor service contracts and purchase commitments, in-license agreements, operating lease agreements and our Zolgensma royalty purchase agreement with HCR. Our material commitments and obligations are further described in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other than the changes described in the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements accompanying this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Note 6, Leases, there have been no material changes to our commitments and obligations since December 31, 2023. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 We have incurred cumulative losses since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of 881.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Our transition to recurring profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure, which depends heavily on the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We do not expect to achieve such revenues, and expect to continue to incur losses, for at least the next several years. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development and general and administrative expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. Subject to obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Additionally, we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures associated with building out additional laboratory and manufacturing capacity to further support the development of our product candidates and potential commercialization efforts. As a result, we will need significant additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more equity offerings, debt financings or other third-party funding, including potential strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the timing of enrollment, commencement and completion of our clinical trials; 

the results of our clinical trials; 

the results of our preclinical studies for our product candidates and any subsequent clinical trials;

revenue received from other commercial sales of our licensees and collaborators products, should any of their product candidates receive marketing approval, and other revenue received under our licensing agreements and collaborations; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; 

our current licensing agreements or collaborations remaining in effect, including the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, and our ability to timely achieve any milestones set forth in such agreements or collaborations; 

our ability to establish and maintain additional licensing agreements or collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and 

the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies. 

Many of these factors are outside of our control. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory and marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our product revenues, if any, and any commercial milestones or royalty payments under our licensing agreements, will be derived from or based on sales of products that may not be commercially available for many years, if at all. In addition, revenue from our NAV Technology Platform licensing is dependent in part on the clinical and commercial success of our licensing partners, including the commercialization of Zolgensma, and on maintaining our license agreements with our licensor partners, including GlaxoSmithKline LLC and The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. 
 The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our intellectual property, our product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 For information regarding market risk, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Control systems, no matter how well conceived and operated, are designed to provide a reasonable, but not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

b. Expenses . REGENXBIO will reimburse Consultant for all reasonable, necessary and documented out-of-pocket expenses directly incurred by Consultant in the performance of Services hereunder, provided that any travel be approved in advance.

The rights and obligations set forth in Sections 3-6 and 8-12 shall survive any expiration or termination of the Agreement. 

4. Confidential Information 

i. Definition of Confidential Information . Confidential Information means any and all confidential or proprietary information and materials that are disclosed or otherwise provided by REGENXBIO or its Affiliates to Consultant or its Affiliates in writing, physically, orally or visually, and that: (a) is identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure; or (b) by its nature should reasonably be understood by Consultant to be confidential or proprietary. Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, any and all information concerning REGENXBIO s technologies, processes, discoveries, methods, patentable and unpatentable ideas, research or development efforts, trade secrets, formulas, business strategies, finances, business operations or affairs and any and all of such information of third parties that REGENXBIO treats as confidential. Confidential Information shall not include any information that Consultant can demonstrate by then-contemporaneous written records (i) is or becomes publicly known through no act or omission of Consultant; (ii) is developed independently by Consultant without use of REGENXBIO s Confidential Information; (iii) is known by Consultant when disclosed by REGENXBIO if Consultant does not then have a duty to maintain its confidentiality; (iv) is rightfully obtained by Consultant 

2 

from a third party who does not owe REGENXBIO a duty to preserve its confidentiality; or (v) is approved for disclosure by the prior written authorization of REGENXBIO. Consultant shall have the burden of proving that information falls within one of the foregoing exceptions. Affiliate of a Party means any other legal entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Party, for as long as such control exists. Control, controlled by and under common control refers to (i) the ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50 of the outstanding voting securities or the capital stock of, or other comparable equity or ownership interest in the respective legal entity, or (ii) in the absence of such ownership interest, the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the respective legal entity, by contract or otherwise.

Consultant shall keep confidential and not disclose Confidential Information to any party other than to its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees, independent contractors who are individuals and professional advisors who have a need to know such information in connection with performance of the Services, and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective of REGENXBIO s Confidential Information as those set forth herein (collectively, the Representatives ). Consultant shall not purchase or sell REGENXBIO s securities while Consultant is in possession of material, nonpublic information relating to REGENXBIO, and Consultant acknowledges that it may be a violation of U.S. federal securities laws for Consultant to engage in such transactions. Consultant shall take action to enforce the obligations and restrictions herein on its Affiliates and Representatives which receive Confidential Information for the Purpose. Consultant shall be liable to REGENXBIO for any non-compliance of those Affiliates and Representatives with such obligations and restrictions to the same extent as Consultant is liable for any such non-compliance on its own part. 

k. Required Disclosure . Notwithstanding Section 4(b), Consultant may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by a court or other governmental authority, provided that Consultant gives REGENXBIO reasonable advance written notice of the disclosure so that REGENXBIO may either seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement for such disclosure. In the event that REGENXBIO is either unable to obtain such remedy or waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, Consultant will thereafter disclose only the minimum Confidential Information required in order to comply. 

l. Return of Materials . Upon the written request of REGENXBIO, Consultant shall return to REGENXBIO, or shall destroy and certify in writing to REGENXBIO that it has destroyed, all drawings, documents, materials, and other tangible embodiments of Confidential Information in Consultant s possession (and all copies and reproductions thereof), except that Consultant may retain one copy thereof solely for archival purposes. 

3

(2) An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
