 of Continental s outstanding common stock. The future value of Continental and resulting estate tax liability are subject to numerous uncertainties and cannot be reasonably quantified at present. The agreement contemplates that Mr. Hamm s estate will defer and pay the potential estate taxes and related interest in installments over a period of up to as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, with the first five years being comprised of interest-only payments and the remaining nine years being comprised of principal and interest payments. Assuming the estate elects to exercise its redemption rights, Continental s potential obligations are expected to occur over the same 14 year period in conjunction with the estate s installment payments. The redemption agreement has no specified number of shares to be redeemed, no specified share repurchase price, no fixed duration of time, and no determinable cash outflows, all of which are unknown and subject to change based on the tax laws in effect and the value of Continental to be determined after Mr. Hamm s passing. Although the timing and amount of Continental s potential obligations under the agreement cannot be reasonably quantified, at September 30, 2024 the Company has recognized a million liability on its balance sheet within the caption Other noncurrent liabilities with a corresponding charge to "Other income (expense) Other on the statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to reflect the intrinsic value of the redemption optionality features contained in the arrangement pursuant to ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement.

Credit Facility At September 30, 2024 the Company had a credit facility, maturing in October 2026, with aggregate lender commitments totaling billion. On October 29, 2024, the Company replaced the prior facility with a new facility containing substantially the same terms as the prior facility with the exception of the change to the terms governing the calculation described under New Facility below.

Credit facility borrowings bear interest at market-based interest rates plus a margin based on the terms of the borrowing and the credit ratings assigned to the Company s senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness.

The New Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than to 1.00, which is unchanged from the prior credit facility. This ratio represents the ratio of (a) net debt (calculated as total face value of debt plus outstanding letters of credit less cash and cash equivalents) divided by (b) the sum of net debt plus total shareholders' equity (i) plus, to the extent resulting in a reduction of total shareholders equity, the amount of any non-cash impairment charges incurred, net of any tax effect, after June 30, 2014 and (ii) plus (to the extent resulting in a reduction of total shareholders equity) or minus (to the extent resulting in an increase of total shareholders equity), as applicable, the amount of the non-cash impact of the accounting treatment for the Redemption Agreement.

 , require the Company to pay per-unit transportation, gathering, or processing charges regardless of the amount of capacity used. Future commitments remaining as of September 30, 2024 under the arrangements amount to approximately million, of which million is expected to be incurred in the remainder of 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027, million in 2028, and million thereafter. A portion of these future costs will be borne by other interest owners. The Company is not committed under the above contracts to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil or natural gas in the future. These commitments do not qualify as leases under ASC Topic 842 and are not recognized on the Company's balance sheet. Litigation pertaining to 2022 take-private transaction In April 2023, three separate putative class action lawsuits were consolidated under the caption In re Continental Resources, Inc. Shareholder Litigation , Case No. CJ-2022-4162, in the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma (the Consolidated Action ). In the Consolidated Action, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated former shareholders of the Company, allege that Mr. Hamm, certain trusts established for the benefit of Mr. Hamm and/or his family members, and the Company s other directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the take-private transaction and seek: (i) monetary damages; (ii) the costs and expenses associated with the lawsuits; and (iii) other equitable relief. The defendants continue to vigorously defend themselves against these claims. In January 2023, FourWorld Deep Value Opportunities Fund I, LLC, FourWorld Event Opportunities, LP, FW Deep Value Opportunities I, LLC, FourWorld Global Opportunities Fund, Ltd., FourWorld Special Opportunities Fund, LLC, Corbin ERISA Opportunity Fund Ltd., and Quadre Investments, L.P. (collectively, FourWorld ), all former shareholders of the Company, filed a petition in the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, seeking appraisal of their respective shares of the Company s common stock in connection with the take-private transaction. In April 2024, Quadre Investments, L.P. filed a voluntary dismissal with prejudice. The Company continues to vigorously defend itself against these claims.

Continental Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 The Company intends to settle all outstanding incentive awards vesting in the future in cash and, thus, the awards are classified as liability awards pursuant to ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation. At September 30, 2024, the Company had recorded a current liability of million and a non-current liability of million in the captions Current portion of incentive compensation liability and Incentive compensation liability, noncurrent, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets associated with the awards. Such amounts reflect the Company s estimate of expected future cash payments multiplied by the percentage of requisite service periods that employees have completed as of September 30, 2024. The Company s compensation expense associated with such awards totaled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in the caption General and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income. As of September 30, 2024 , there was approximately million of unrecognized liabilities and compensation expense related to unvested awards, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. The Company s incentive compensation liability will be remeasured each reporting period leading up to the applicable award vesting dates to reflect additional service rendered by employees and to reflect changes in expected cash payments arising from underlying changes in the value of the Company based on independent third party appraisals. Changes in the liability will be recorded as increases or decreases to compensation expense. The Company has estimated the number of forfeitures expected to occur in determining the amount of liability and expense to recognize.

 The 9 decrease in crude oil production and 11 decrease in natural gas production in the 2024 third quarter were primarily driven by natural declines in production coupled with planned moderation in capital spending, asset divestitures, and variation in the timing of new well completions compared to the prior period. Revenues Our revenues consist of sales of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments, and revenues associated with crude oil and natural gas service operations. 

 16 

Crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids sales. Sales totaled 1.71 billion for the third quarter of 2024, an 18 decrease compared to sales of 2.08 billion for the third quarter of 2023 due to decreases in crude oil and natural gas sales prices coupled with a decrease in sales volumes as discussed below. Total sales volumes for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 3,765 MBoe, or 9 , compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to the previously described decrease in production volumes. For the third quarter of 2024, our crude oil sales volumes decreased 7 and our natural gas sales volumes decreased 11 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our crude oil sales prices averaged 74.80 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 81.99 per barrel for the third quarter of 2023. Our natural gas sales prices averaged 1.75 per Mcf for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.37 per Mcf for the third quarter of 2023. Derivatives. Changes in settled and future commodity prices during the third quarter of 2024 had a net favorable impact on the fair value of our derivatives, which resulted in positive revenue adjustments totaling 270.0 million for the period, representing 104.0 million of cash gains and 166.0 million of unsettled non-cash gains, compared to negative revenue adjustments totaling 335.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating Costs and Expenses Production Expenses . Production expenses increased 18.0 million, or 10 , to 193.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 175.8 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in the number of producing wells from drilling and completion activities and higher workover-related activities aimed at enhancing production from producing properties. Production expenses on a per-Boe basis averaged 5.10 per Boe for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.21 per Boe for the third quarter of 2023. Production and Ad Valorem Taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased 30.8 million, or 19 , to 131.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 162.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to the previously described decrease in total commodity revenues. Our production taxes as a percentage of net sales averaged 8.1 for the third quarter of 2024, consistent with 8.1 for the third quarter of 2023. Transportation, gathering, processing, and compression. These charges increased 2.3 million, or 3 , to 89.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 86.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to changes in marketing terms and arrangements utilized between periods and an increase in our working interest share of cost burdens in certain operating areas. Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. Total DD A increased 36.9 million, or 6 , to 613.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 577.0 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in our DD A rate per Boe as further discussed below. The following table shows the components of our DD A on a unit of sales basis for the periods presented.

Estimated proved reserves are a key component in our computation of DD A expense. Proved reserves are determined using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months as required by SEC rules. Holding all other factors constant, if proved reserves are revised downward due to commodity price declines or other reasons, the rate at which we record DD A expense increases. Conversely, if proved reserves are revised upward, the rate at which we record DD A expense decreases. Certain of our proved reserves have been revised downward over the past year prompted by decreases in rolling twelve-month average SEC commodity prices and other factors, which contributed to an increase in our DD A rate for crude oil and natural gas properties along with variation in the mix of sales volumes across the Company s operating areas between periods. 

 17 

General and Administrative Expenses. Total G A expenses decreased 47.7 million, or 42 , to 64.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 112.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Total G A expenses include charges for long-term incentive compensation awards of 15.9 million and 61.4 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease was driven by changes in the remeasurement of outstanding award liabilities resulting from variation in the value of the Company between periods, which led to volatility in the magnitude of expense recognized in the 2023 period relative to the 2024 period. G A expenses other than incentive compensation awards totaled 48.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, generally consistent with 51.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The following table shows the components of G A expenses on a unit of sales basis for the periods presented.

Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased 37.2 million, or 37 , to 63.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 100.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to a decrease in our weighted average outstanding debt balance from 7.9 billion for the third quarter of 2023 to 5.3 billion for the third quarter of 2024. This decrease was driven by debt reduction throughout the past year, including the reduction of credit facility borrowings, the repayment of our 750 million term loan, and the redemption of our 893.1 million of 2024 Notes. Other income (expense) Other. In the third quarter of 2024 the fair value of the option liability described in Note 6. Fair Value Measurements Stock Redemption Option in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements was remeasured, which resulted in a 46 million decrease in the liability and corresponding recognition of income in the third quarter period reflecting a reduction in value as of September 30, 2024 compared to the June 30, 2024 valuation. Income Taxes. For the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 we provided for income taxes at a combined federal and state tax rate of 23.5 of our pre-tax income. We recorded income tax provisions of 138.5 million and 106.0 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, which resulted in effective tax rates of 16.1 and 22.2 , respectively, after taking into account the application of statutory tax rates, permanent taxable differences, estimated tax credits, and other items.

 The 1 increase in crude oil production and 4 decrease in natural gas production for year to date 2024 compared to year to date 2023 was driven by an increase in allocation of capital to oil-weighted projects in our operating areas and variation in the timing of new well completions between years. 

 19 

Revenues Crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids sales. Sales for year to date 2024 totaled 5.52 billion, a 2 decrease compared to 5.66 billion for the comparable 2023 period driven by decreases in natural gas sales prices and natural gas sales volumes as discussed below. Total sales volumes for year to date 2024 decreased 1,049 MBoe, or 1 , compared to year to date 2023 primarily due to the previously described decrease in natural gas production volumes. For year to date 2024, our crude oil sales volumes increased 2 while our natural gas sales volumes decreased 4 compared to year to date 2023. Our crude oil sales prices averaged 77.02 per barrel for year to date 2024 compared to 76.93 per barrel for year to date 2023. Our natural gas sales prices averaged 2.01 per Mcf for year to date 2024 compared to 2.68 per Mcf for year to date 2023. Derivatives. Changes in settled and future commodity prices during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 had a net favorable impact on the fair value of our derivatives, which resulted in positive revenue adjustments totaling 161.5 million for the period, representing 286.7 million of cash gains partially offset by 125.2 million of unsettled non-cash losses, compared to positive revenue adjustments totaling 270.8 million in the comparable 2023 period. Operating Costs and Expenses Production Expenses . Production expenses increased 33.0 million, or 6 , to 565.2 million for year to date 2024 compared to 532.2 million for year to date 2023 due to an increase in the number of producing wells from drilling and completion activities, costs associated with adverse winter weather conditions in the Bakken and Powder River Basin in the 2024 first quarter, and higher workover-related activities aimed at enhancing production from producing properties. Production expenses on a per-Boe basis averaged 4.81 per Boe for year to date 2024 compared to 4.49 per Boe for year to date 2023. Production and Ad Valorem Taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased 12.1 million, or 3 , to 428.3 million for year to date 2024 compared to 440.4 million for year to date 2023 due to the previously described decrease in total commodity revenues. Our production taxes as a percentage of net sales averaged 8.2 for year to date 2024, consistent with 8.1 for year to date 2023. Transportation, gathering, processing, and compression. These charges increased 43.3 million, or 18 , to 288.6 million for year to date 2024 compared to 245.3 million for year to date 2023 due to changes in marketing terms and arrangements utilized between periods and an increase in our working interest share of cost burdens in certain operating areas. Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion. Total DD A increased 269.7 million, or 17 , to 1.87 billion for year to date 2024 compared to 1.60 billion for year to date 2023 due to the previously described increase in our DD A rate per Boe and variation in the mix of sales volumes across the Company s operating areas between periods.

Property Impairments. Total property impairments decreased 11.8 million to 34.7 million for year to date 2024 compared to 46.5 million for year to date 2023 primarily due to the recognition of 10.3 million of proved property impairments in the prior period with no proved property impairments being recognized in the current period. General and Administrative Expenses. Total G A expenses decreased 19.2 million, or 8 , to 211.6 million for year to date 2024 compared to 230.8 million for year to date 2023. Total G A expenses include charges for long-term incentive compensation awards of 69.2 million and 86.9 million for the year to date periods of 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease was driven by changes in the remeasurement of outstanding award

Interest expense decreased 90.7 million, or 30 , to 215.3 million for year to date 2024 compared to 306.0 million for year to date 2023 due to a decrease in our weighted average outstanding debt balance from 8.1 billion for year to date 2023 to 6.0 billion for year to date 2024. This decrease was driven by debt reduction throughout the past year, including the reduction of credit facility borrowings, the repayment of our 750 million term loan, and the redemption of our 893 million of 2024 Notes. Other income (expense) Other. See Note 6. Fair Value Measurements Stock Redemption Option in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . Income Taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we provided for income taxes at a combined federal and state tax rate of 23.5 of our pre-tax income. We recorded income tax provisions of 401.1 million and 539.1 million for the year to date periods of 2024 and 2023, respectively, which resulted in effective tax rates of 23.8 and 21.7 , respectively, after taking into account the application of statutory tax rates, permanent taxable differences, estimated tax credits, and other items. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash flows generated from operating activities, financing provided by our credit facility, and the issuance of debt securities. Additionally, asset dispositions and joint development arrangements have provided a source of cash flow for use in reducing debt and enhancing liquidity. On October 29, 2024, we entered into a new credit facility New Facility to replace our prior credit facility. The New Facility extended the maturity date from October 2026 to October 2029 and reduced the aggregate lender commitments from 2.255 billion to 1.80 billion. At October 31, 2024, we had 100 million of outstanding borrowings and 1.7 billion of borrowing availability under our New Facility. Our New Facility remains unsecured and has no borrowing base requirement subject to redetermination. Based on our planned capital spending, our forecasted cash flows and projected levels of indebtedness, we expect to maintain compliance with the covenants under our New Facility and senior note indentures. Further, based on current market indications, we expect to meet our contractual cash commitments to third parties as of September 30, 2024, including those subsequently described under the heading Future Capital Requirements , recognizing we may be required to meet such commitments even if our business plan assumptions were to change. We monitor our capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and have the ability to reduce spending or dispose of assets if needed to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility to fund our operations. C ash Flows Cash flows from operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 35 million, or 1 , to 3.53 billion for year to date 2024 compared to 3.57 billion for year to date 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by our 140 million decrease in crude oil, natural gas and NGL revenues along with increases in certain cash operating expenses including a 33 million increase in production expenses, a 43 

 21 

million increase in transportation, gathering, processing, and compression expenses, and a 158 million increase in cash payments for income taxes. These decreases in cash flows were partially offset by a 77 million increase in realized cash gains on matured commodity derivatives, a 75 million decrease in cash payments for interest on our outstanding debt, and a 12 million decrease in production and ad valorem taxes. Cash flows from investing activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled 1.86 billion for year to date 2024 compared to 2.77 billion for year to date 2023. Our investing cash flows for year to date 2024 included 2.14 billion of exploration and development costs compared to 2.80 billion for year to date 2023, reflecting variation in the timing of our capital spending between periods. For full year 2024 our capital expenditures budget attributable to us is 3.4 billion compared to 3.3 billion of non-acquisition capital spending in full year 2023. In addition, net cash used in investing activities was further decreased by lower acquisitions of producing crude oil and natural gas properties, with 1.2 million acquired for year to date 2024 compared to 162.0 million acquired for year to date 2023. Proceeds received from the sale of assets also increased by 89.6 million for year to date 2024 compared to the prior year to date period. Cash flows from financing activities Net cash used in financing activities for year to date 2024 totaled 1.67 billion driven by 1.67 billion of net repayments of outstanding debt. Net cash used in financing activities for year to date 2023 totaled 886.8 million, primarily consisting of 866.8 million of net repayments on outstanding debt and 25.3 million of cash distributed to noncontrolling interests. Future Sources of Financing Although we cannot provide any assurance, we believe funds from operating cash flows, our cash balance, and availability under our credit facility should be sufficient to meet our normal operating needs, debt service obligations, budgeted capital expenditures, and cash payments for income taxes for at least the next 12 months and to meet our contractual cash commitments to third parties described under the heading Future Capital Requirements beyond 12 months. Based on current market indications supported by cash flow protection provided by our hedge portfolio against commodity price declines, our budgeted capital spending plans over the next 12 months are expected to be funded from operating cash flows. Any deficiencies in operating cash flows relative to budgeted spending are expected to be funded by borrowings under our credit facility. If cash flows are materially impacted by declines in commodity prices, we have the ability to reduce our capital expenditures or utilize the availability of our credit facility if needed to fund our operations. We may choose to access banking or debt capital markets for additional financing or capital to fund our operations or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. Further, we may sell assets or enter into strategic joint development opportunities in order to obtain funding if such transactions can be executed on satisfactory terms. However, no assurance can be given that such transactions will occur. Credit facility On October 29, 2024, we entered into a New Facility, maturing in October 2029, with aggregate lender commitments totaling 1.80 billion. The commitments are from a syndicate of 14 banks and financial institutions. We believe each member of the current syndicate has the capability to fund its commitment. The commitments under our New Facility are not dependent on a borrowing base calculation subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves. Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating do not trigger a reduction in our current credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or change in covenants. Our New Facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, or merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Our New Facility 

 22 

also contains a requirement that we maintain a consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00, which is unchanged from the prior credit facility. See Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Debt for a discussion of how this ratio is calculated pursuant to our credit agreement, as entered into on October 29, 2024. We were in compliance with our credit facility covenants at September 30, 2024 and expect to maintain compliance. At September 30, 2024, our consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio calculated pursuant to our New Facility was 0.28. We do not believe the New Facility covenants are reasonably likely to limit our ability to undertake additional debt financing if needed to support our business. Future Capital Requirements Our material future cash requirements are summarized below. Based on current market indications, we expect to meet our contractual cash commitments to third parties as of September 30, 2024, recognizing we may be required to meet such commitments even if our business plan assumptions were to change. Senior notes Our debt includes outstanding senior note obligations totaling 4.8 billion at September 30, 2024, exclusive of interest payment obligations thereon. Our senior notes are not subject to any mandatory redemption or sinking fund requirements. For further information on the face values, maturity dates, semi-annual interest payment dates, optional redemption periods and covenant restrictions related to our senior notes, refer to Note 7. Debt in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . We were in compliance with our senior note covenants at September 30, 2024 and expect to maintain compliance. We do not believe the senior note covenants will materially limit our ability to undertake additional debt financing. Downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to the credit ratings assigned to our senior unsecured debt do not trigger additional senior note covenants. Credit facility borrowings As of October 31, 2024, we had 100 million of outstanding borrowings on our New Facility. Our New Facility matures in October 2029. Transportation, gathering, and processing commitments We have entered into transportation, gathering, and processing commitments to guarantee capacity on crude oil and natural gas pipelines and natural gas processing facilities that require us to pay per-unit charges regardless of the amount of capacity used. Future commitments remaining as of September 30, 2024 under the arrangements amount to approximately 868 million. See Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Capital expenditures Our capital expenditures budget for 2024 is expected to be 3.4 billion. Costs of acquisitions and investments are not budgeted, with the exception of planned levels of spending for mineral acquisitions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 2.3 billion in our capital program, excluding 17 million of unbudgeted acquisitions and 21 million of mineral acquisitions attributable to Franco-Nevada. Our drilling and completion activities and the actual amount and timing of our capital expenditures may differ materially from our budget as a result of, among other things, available cash flows, unbudgeted acquisitions, actual drilling and completion results, operational process improvements, the availability of drilling and completion rigs and other services and equipment, cost inflation, the availability of transportation, gathering and processing capacity, changes in commodity prices, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. We monitor our capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and may adjust our spending should commodity prices materially change from current levels. We expect to continue participating as a buyer of properties when and if we have the ability to increase our position in strategic plays at attractive terms. 

 23 

Cash payments for income taxes For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made cash payments for federal and state income taxes totaling 614 million, representing payments associated with 2023 tax return filing extensions and estimated quarterly payments for 2024 federal and state income taxes based on estimates of taxable income for 2024. Significant judgment is involved in estimating future taxable income, as we are required to make assumptions about future commodity prices, projected production, development activities, capital spending, profitability, and general economic conditions, all of which are subject to material revision in future periods as better information becomes available. If commodity prices remain at current levels, we expect to continue generating significant taxable income through at least year-end 2025, which would result in us continuing to make estimated tax payments on a quarterly basis in 2025. Because of the significant uncertainty inherent in numerous factors utilized in projecting taxable income, we cannot predict the amount of future income tax payments with certainty. Long-term incentive compensation awards At December 31, 2023 we had recognized a current liability of 131 million on the condensed consolidated balance sheet associated with unvested incentive compensation awards granted to employees, which was subsequently paid in cash to employees in February 2024 upon the scheduled vesting of the awards. We granted additional incentive compensation awards in 2024 and intend to continue granting additional awards on an annual basis that we plan to settle in cash upon vesting. At September 30, 2024 we have recognized a current liability of 66.5 million and a non-current liability of 30.7 million associated with unvested awards granted to employees that are scheduled to vest in 2025, 2026, and 2027. Our recognized liabilities will be remeasured each reporting period leading up to the applicable award vesting dates to reflect additional services rendered by employees and to reflect changes in expected cash payments arising from underlying changes in the value of the Company based on independent third party appraisals. Stock redemption option See Note 6. Fair Value Measurements Stock Redemption Option in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . Derivative Instruments The fair value of our derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 was a net asset of 382.8 million. See Note 5. Derivative Instruments in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our hedging activities, including a summary of derivative contracts in place as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of our derivatives is highly sensitive to market price volatility and therefore subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for information on how hypothetical changes in commodity prices would impact the fair value of our derivatives as of September 30, 2024. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.

ITEM 3.	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk	 General. We are exposed to a variety of market risks including commodity price risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. We seek to address these risks through a program of risk management which may include the use of derivative instruments. Commodity Price Risk. Our primary market risk exposure is in the prices we receive from sales of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas and natural gas liquids production. Commodity prices have been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control, including differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index prices. Based on our average daily production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and excluding the effect of derivative instruments in place, our annual revenue would increase or decrease by approximately 837 million for each 10.00 per barrel change in crude oil prices at September 30, 2024 and 434 million for each 1.00 per Mcf change in natural gas prices at September 30, 2024. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in commodity prices, from time to time we economically hedge a portion of our anticipated production as part of our risk management program. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between derivative contract index prices and those of our physical pricing points. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps secure funds to be used for our capital program and general corporate purposes. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. We may choose not to hedge future production if the price environment for certain time periods is deemed to be unfavorable. Additionally, we may choose to settle existing derivative positions prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities. While hedging, if utilized, limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it also limits future revenues from upward price movements. The fair value of our derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 was a net asset of 382.8 million, which is comprised of a 290.2 million net asset associated with our natural gas derivatives and a 92.6 million net asset associated with our crude oil derivatives. The following table shows how a hypothetical +/- 10 change in the underlying forward prices used to calculate the fair value of our derivatives would impact the fair value estimates as of September 30, 2024.

Changes in the fair value of our derivatives from the above price sensitivities would produce a corresponding change in our total revenues. Credit Risk. We monitor our risk of loss due to non-performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. Our principal exposure to credit risk is through the sale of our production, which we market to energy marketing companies, crude oil refining companies, and natural gas gathering and processing companies 970 million in receivables at September 30, 2024), and our joint interest and other receivables 325 million at September 30, 2024). We monitor our exposure to counterparties on our commodity sales primarily by reviewing credit ratings, financial statements and payment history. We extend credit terms based on our evaluation of each counterparty s credit worthiness. We have not generally required our counterparties to provide collateral to secure commodity sales receivables owed to us. Historically, our credit losses on commodity sales receivables have been immaterial. Joint interest receivables arise from billing the individuals and entities who own a partial interest in the wells we operate. These individuals and entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases included in units on which we wish to drill. We can do very little to choose who participates in our wells. In order to minimize our exposure to this credit risk we generally request prepayment of drilling costs where it is allowed by contract or state law. For such prepayments, a liability is recorded and subsequently reduced as the associated work is performed. This liability was 48 million at September 30, 2024, which will be used to 

 25 

offset future capital costs when billed. In this manner, we reduce credit risk. We may have the right to place a lien on a co-owner's interest in the well, to net production proceeds against amounts owed in order to secure payment or, if necessary, foreclose on the interest. Historically, our credit losses on joint interest receivables have been immaterial. Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to variable-rate borrowings we have outstanding from time to time under our credit facility. Such borrowings bear interest at market-based interest rates plus a margin based on the terms of the borrowing and the credit ratings assigned to our senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness. All of our other long-term indebtedness is fixed rate and does not expose us to the risk of cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. We had 100 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding on our credit facility at October 31, 2024. The impact of a 0.25 increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in increased interest expense and reduced income before income taxes of approximately 0.3 million per year. We manage our interest rate exposure by monitoring both the effects of market changes in interest rates and the proportion of our debt portfolio that is variable-rate versus fixed-rate debt. We may utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues. Interest rate derivatives may be used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio. We currently have no interest rate derivatives. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports it files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Controls and Procedures A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met.

While the outcome of these legal matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.

In determining what he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation in the performance of his or her duties as a Director (including a member of the Executive Committee, if any), a Director may consider, to the extent permitted by law, both in the consideration of tender and exchange offers, mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of the Corporation s assets and otherwise, such factors as the Board of Directors or the Executive Committee determines to be relevant, including, without limitation: (a) The long-term and short-term interests of the Corporation and its shareholders, including the possibility that the interests may be best served by the continued independence of the Corporation; 

 (b) Whether the proposed transaction might violate state or federal laws; 

 (c) If applicable, not only the consideration being offered in a proposed transaction, the estimated price that might be achieved in a negotiated sale of the Corporation as a whole or in part through orderly liquidation, the premiums over market price for the securities of other corporations in similar transactions, current political, economic and other factors bearing on securities prices, and the Corporation s financial condition and future prospects; and 

 (d) The interests of the Corporation s employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the economy of the state, region and nation, and community and societal considerations. 

 In connection with any such evaluation, the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee are each authorized to conduct such investigations and to engage in such legal proceedings as the Board of Directors may determine. 6.2	 Management of Business . The following provisions are included for the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and for the purpose of creating, defining, limiting, and regulating the powers of the Corporation and its Directors and shareholders. (a) Subject to the rights of any holders of any series of Preferred Stock, if any, to elect additional Directors under specified circumstances, the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors may remove any Director or the entire Board of Directors, with or without cause. 

 (b) The Bylaws may provide for the designation of one or more Directors to serve on an Executive Committee. As authorized under subsection A of Section 1027 of the Act, the Executive Committee and its members may exercise or perform any of the powers or duties otherwise conferred or imposed upon the Board of Directors or the Directors under the Act. The acts of the Executive Committee shall not take precedence over any conflicting act of the Board of Directors. Any reference to the Executive Committee in this Sixth Amended and Restated Certificate shall not be construed to require the existence of such a committee for purposes of this document but are included to clarify the scope of authority available to such committee, if constituted. 

4 

(c) Vacancies in the Board of Directors or the Executive Committee resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause and newly created Directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of Directors shall be filled in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. 

 (d) The election of Directors may be conducted in any manner approved by the Board of Directors at the time when the election is held and need not be by written ballot. 

 (e) All corporate powers and authority of the Corporation (except as at the time otherwise provided by law, by this Certificate of Incorporation or by the Bylaws) shall be jointly vested in and severally exercised by the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. 

 (f) The Board of Directors and the Executive Committee shall each have the power without the assent or vote of the shareholders to adopt, amend, alter, or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. 

 6.3	 Limitation of Director and Officer Liability . No director or officer shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer. Notwithstanding, the foregoing sentence, does not eliminate or limit the liability of: (a) a director or officer for any breach of the director s or officer s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders, (b) a director or officer for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) a director under Section 1053 of the Act, or (d) a director or officer for any transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit, or (e) an officer in any action by or in the right of the Corporation. No amendment to or repeal of this subsection 6.3 shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director or officer for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director or officer occurring before such amendment. SECTION 7. Reservation of Right to Amend . The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change, or repeal any provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or later prescribed by statute. All rights, powers, privileges, and discretionary authority granted or conferred upon shareholders or Board of Directors are granted subject to this reservation. The foregoing Sixth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted by the Corporation s Board of Directors and shareholders in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 1077 and 1080 of the Act and is executed this August 5, 2024, by the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Corporation.

Article 2 Offices 2.1	 Principal Office . The Corporation may locate its principal office within or without the state of incorporation as the Board or any Executive Committee may determine. 2.2	 Registered Office . The registered office of the Corporation required by law to be maintained in the state of incorporation may be, but need not be, identical with the principal office of the Corporation. The Board or any Executive Committee may change the address of the registered office from time to time. 2.3	 Other Offices . The Corporation may have offices at such other places, either within or without the state of incorporation, as the Board or any Executive Committee may designate or as the business of the Corporation may require from time to time. 

 1 

Article 3 Meetings of Shareholders 3.1	 Annual Meetings . The Shareholders of the Corporation shall hold their annual meetings for electing Directors and for the transaction of such other proper business as may come before the meetings at such time, date and place (if any) as the Board, Executive Committee, Executive Chairperson, or the CEO shall determine by resolution. 3.2	 Special Meetings . The Board, Executive Committee, Executive Chairperson, or CEO duly designated and whose powers and authority include the power to call meetings may call special meetings of the Shareholders of the Corporation at any time for any purpose or purposes. 3.3	 Place of Meetings . The Board, Executive Committee, Executive Chairperson, or CEO shall specify in the notice or waiver of notice for a meeting the place, if any, where the Shareholders are to meet. A place may be within or without the State of Oklahoma. In lieu of or in addition to a place, the Board, Executive Committee, Executive Chairperson, or CEO may direct that the meeting be held by means of remote communication if: (a) the Corporation has implemented reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a Shareholder or proxyholder; (b) the Corporation has implemented measures to provide the Shareholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the Shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (c) if any Shareholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of the vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation. 3.4	 Notice of Meetings . Unless waived by all Shareholders, the Board, Executive Committee, Executive Chairperson, or CEO shall give written notice (which may be by electronic transmission) of each meeting of Shareholders, whether annual or special, not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting; provided, however, that if the purpose of the meeting is to vote on a merger, a consolidation, a share acquisition under Section 1090.1 of the Act, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation s property and assets, written notice shall be delivered not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary that he or she has given notice shall constitute, in the absence of fraud, prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit. Every notice of a meeting of the Shareholders shall state the place (if any), date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications (if any) by which Shareholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes of the meeting. 3.5	 Waiver of Notice . Whenever these Bylaws require written notice or an electronic transmission, a written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, or an electronic transmission issued by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated in the notice, shall constitute the equivalent of notice. Attendance of a person at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the call of the meeting and makes an objection at the beginning of the meeting. A written waiver of notice need not specify either the business to be transacted at, or the purpose or purposes of any annual or special meeting of the Shareholders, Directors, members 

 2 

of any Executive Committee, or members of a committee of the Board or any Executive Committee. 3.6	 Reconvened Meetings . If the Shareholders adjourn a meeting intending to reconvene the meeting at another time or place (if any), notice need not be given of the meeting to be reconvened if the time and place (if any) thereof, and the means of remote communications (if any) by which Shareholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at the adjourned meeting are announced before adjournment or displayed during the time scheduled for the meeting on the same electronic network used to enable shareholders and proxy holders to participate in the meeting by means of remote communication, and the meeting is to be reconvened no more than 30 days after the adjourned meeting. At the reconvened meeting, the Shareholders may transact any business that they may have transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days or, if after the adjournment, the Board, Executive Committee, Executive Chairperson, or CEO fixes a new record date, or changes the time or place (if any) of, or the means of remote communication for the reconvened meeting, the Board, Executive Committee, Executive Chairperson, or CEO shall give notice of the meeting to be reconvened to each Shareholder of record entitled to vote. 3.7	 Quorum . The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of convening or reconvening any meeting of the Shareholders. Except as otherwise required by law, the Shareholders may continue to transact any and all business properly before the meeting despite the loss of a quorum, if a quorum was established and the meeting properly convened. In the absence of a quorum, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are then present in person or by proxy or any officer entitled to preside at, or to act as secretary of, the meeting may adjourn the meeting to another place, date, or time. 3.8	 Organization . The Executive Chairperson, or in the absence of such a person, the highest-ranking officer of the Corporation who is present shall call to order any meeting of the Shareholders, determine the presence of a quorum, and act as Chairperson of the meeting. In the absence of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, the Chairperson shall appoint the secretary of the meeting. 3.9	 Conduct of Business . The Executive Chairperson shall determine the order of business of any Shareholders meeting and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulations of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion, as he or she deems appropriate for the good of the Shareholders present. The Managing Shareholder or his or her designee shall serve as Executive Chairperson. If two individuals are serving as Managing Shareholder, then the role of Executive Chairperson will be filled by the Managing Shareholder designated to act as Executive Chairperson as contemplated by the Shareholders Agreement. If the Managing Shareholders have not designated one of them to act as Executive Chairperson, then the Managing Shareholders shall act together as Executive Chairperson as contemplated under the Shareholders Agreement. If two Managing Shareholders are serving as Executive Chairperson, any reference herein to Executive Chairperson shall be deemed a reference to both individuals. 3.10	 Fixing of the Record Date . To determine Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or Shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or to determine Shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board or any Executive Committee may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination 

 3 

of Shareholders, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board or any Executive Committee. The Board or any Executive Committee shall not fix the date more than 60 days before the date of the particular action and, when determining shareholders entitled to notice of a meeting or any adjournment, the record date shall not be less than ten days before the date of the meeting. When the Board or any Executive Committee fixes the record date for a meeting notice, it may determine that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting. If the Board or any Executive Committee does not fix a record date for the determination of Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders, the date of the mailing of notice or the date on which the Board or any Executive Committee adopts the resolution declaring a dividend, as the case may be, shall be the record date for the determination of Shareholders. If the Board or any Executive Committee does not fix a record date and action is to be taken by the written consent of the Shareholders, the record date shall be the first date on which a signed written consent is delivered to the Corporation; provided, however, if prior action by the Board or any Executive Committee is required under the Act, the record date shall be at the close of business of the day on which the Board or any Executive Committee adopts the resolution taking such prior action. 3.11	 Voting of Shares . Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and to Article VI of the Shareholder Agreement, each Shareholder shall have one vote for every share of stock having voting rights registered in his or her name on the record date for the meeting. The Corporation shall not have the right to vote its treasury stock, nor shall another corporation have the right to vote its stock of the Corporation if the Corporation holds, directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of Directors of the other corporation. Nevertheless, persons holding stock of the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity (including the Corporation) shall have the right to vote the stock. Persons who have pledged their stock of the Corporation have the right to vote the stock unless in the transfer on the books of the Corporation the pledgor expressly empowered the pledgee to vote the stock. In that event, only the pledgee, or his or her proxy, may represent and vote the stock. A plurality of the votes cast shall determine all elections and, except when the law or a resolution of the Board or any Executive Committee requires otherwise, a majority of the votes cast shall determine all other matters. The Shareholders may vote by voice vote or electronic medium as determined by the Executive Chairperson on all matters. Upon demand by a Shareholder entitled to vote, or his or her proxy, however, the Shareholders shall vote by ballot. In that event, each ballot shall state the name of the Shareholder or proxy voting, the number of shares voted and such other information as the Corporation may require under the procedure established for the meeting. If authorized by the Board or any Executive Committee, the ballot requirement may be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission, if the electronic transmission sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder or proxyholder. 3.12	 Inspectors . At any meeting in which the Shareholders vote by ballot, the Board or any Executive Committee may appoint an inspector or inspectors. Each inspector shall subscribe an oath to execute the duties of an inspector at the meeting faithfully, with strict impartiality, and 

 4 

according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors shall decide the qualification of the voters and shall report the number of shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on any question, shall conduct and accept the votes, and, when the Shareholders have completed voting, ascertain and report the number of shares voted respectively for and against the question. The inspector or inspectors shall prepare a subscribed, written report and shall deliver the report to the Secretary of the Corporation. An inspector need not be a Shareholder of the Corporation, and any officer of the Corporation may act as an inspector on any question other than a vote for or against a proposal in which he or she has a material interest. 3.13	 Proxies . A Shareholder may exercise any voting rights in person or by his or her proxy appointed by an instrument in writing or by electronic transmission, which the Shareholder or his or her authorized attorney in fact has subscribed and which the proxy has delivered to the secretary of the meeting. A proxy is not valid after the expiration of three years after the date of its execution, unless the person executing it specifies thereon the length of time for which it is to continue in force (which length may exceed three years) or limits its use to a particular meeting. The attendance at any meeting of a Shareholder who previously has given a proxy shall not revoke the proxy unless he or she notifies the Secretary in writing or by electronic transmission before the voting of the proxy. 3.14	 Consent of Shareholders in Lieu of Meeting . The Shareholders may take any action that they could take at any annual or special meeting without a meeting, prior notice, or a vote if the holders of outstanding stock having the number of votes necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote were present and voted, sign a consent or consents, setting forth the action taken, and deliver the consent or consents to the Corporation. To be effective, a consent or consents representing the required number of votes must be delivered to the Corporation within 60 days of the day that the first consent was delivered with respect to the action taken. The consent or consents must be delivered to (a) the Corporation s principal place of business, (b) the officer who has custody of the minute book, (c) the registered office in Oklahoma in person or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or (d) an information processing system designated by the Corporation for receiving the consents. Consents delivered under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) shall be reproduced and delivered in paper form. The Secretary or an Assistant Secretary shall note the delivery date for each consent delivered to the Corporation and shall give prompt notice of the taking of any action by less than unanimous consent to the Shareholders who have not delivered consents. A Shareholder may act by an electronic transmission, if the electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine: (a) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the Shareholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the Shareholder or proxyholder; and (b) the date on which the Shareholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons made the electronic transmission. Unless otherwise indicated, the date on which the electronic transmission is made shall be deemed to be the date on which the consent was signed. A consent given by electronic transmission is deemed to have been delivered when the consent is received by the Corporation at terminal used by the Secretary for the receipt of the transmissions. Any copy, electronic or other reliable 

 5 

reproduction of a consent may be substituted or used in lieu of the original consent for any and all purposes for which the original consent could be used. Article 4 Board of Directors 4.1	 General Powers . The Board, Executive Committee or either of them shall manage the property, business, and affairs of the Corporation. 4.2	 Executive Committee . The Corporation may have an Executive Committee composed of Directors appointed by the Board. As authorized in the Corporation s certificate of incorporation, any Executive Committee will have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the property, business, and affairs of the Corporation. Any references to the Executive Committee in these Bylaws shall not be construed to require the existence of an Executive Committee for purposes of this document but are included to clarify the scope of authority available to an Executive Committee, if constituted. 4.3	 Number . The number of Directors constituting the Board shall equal not less than one or more than ten, as the Board may determine by resolution from time to time. Unless an election is contested, a Board resolution nominating persons for election shall suffice to evidence the fixing of the number of Directors constituting the Board. 4.3	 Election of Directors and Term of Office . The Shareholders of the Corporation shall elect the Directors at the annual or adjourned annual meeting (except as otherwise provided for the filling of vacancies) or by consent in lieu of a meeting. Each Director shall hold office until his or her death, resignation, retirement, removal, or disqualification, or until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified. 4.4	 Resignations . Any Director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice or an electronic transmission to the Board or to the Secretary of the Corporation. Any resignation shall take effect upon receipt or at the time specified in the notice. Unless the notice specifies otherwise, the effectiveness of the resignation shall not depend upon its acceptance. 4.5	 Removal . Shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at an election of Directors may remove any Director at any time with or without cause. 4.6	 Vacancies . A majority of the remaining Directors, although less than a quorum, or the Executive Committee may fill any vacancy in the Board, whether because of death, resignation, disqualification, an increase in the number of Directors, or any other cause. Each Director so chosen shall hold office until his or her death, resignation, retirement, removal, or disqualification, or until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified. 4.7	 Executive Chairperson . The Managing Shareholder(s) shall serve as Executive Chairperson of the Board. If he or she is unable or unwilling to serve, the Directors may elect from their number a Chairperson of the Board. The Executive Chairperson shall preside at all meetings of the Board and shall perform such other duties as the Board may direct. The Board also may elect a Vice Chairperson and other officers of the Board, with the powers and duties as the Board may designate from time to time. 4.8	 Compensation . The Board may compensate Directors for their services and may provide for the payment of all expenses the Directors incur by attending meetings of the Board. 

 6 

4.9	Advisory Members of the Board and/or Executive Committee. The Board or any Executive Committee may appoint from one to seven (as it may decide from time to time) Advisory Members of the Board and/or any Executive Committee Advisory Members ), who may meet with the Board, Executive Committee or any Board committees at such meetings to which they are invited by Board, Executive Committee or Executive Chairperson, and give the Board, Executive Committee or Board committees the benefit of their advice and counsel. The Advisory Members may be elected at any regular or special meeting of the Board or the Executive Committee, serve at the pleasure of the Board and/or any Executive Committee, have no right to voice or vote, and are not counted for quorum purposes. Advisory Members are not subject to any of the duties or obligations applicable to Directors under state or other applicable laws or regulations. Article 5 Meetings of Directors 5.1	 Regular Meetings . The Board may hold regular meetings at such places (if any), dates and times as the Board shall establish. The Board need not give notice of regular meetings. 5.2	 Place of Meetings . The Board may hold its meetings wherever or however designated by the Board, the notice or waiver of notice of any meeting, or the persons calling the meeting. 5.3	 Meetings by Telecommunications . The Board or any committee of the Board may hold meetings by means of conference telephone, video conferencing, web-casting or other telecommunications equipment that enable all persons participating in the meeting to hear and speak to each other. Such participation shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 5.4	 Special Meetings . The Executive Chairperson, the CEO, or a majority of the Directors then in office may call a special meeting of the Board. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board may fix any time during a business day as the time for the meeting and may fix a reasonable place (if any) as the place for the meeting. 5.5	 Notice of Special Meetings . The person or persons calling a special meeting of the Board shall give notice to each Director of the time, place (if any), date and purpose of the meeting. Such notice shall be given not less than three business days if by U.S. postal service, not less than two business days if by overnight delivery service, and not less than 24 hours if by e-mail or other electronic transmission, or in person. A Director may waive notice of any special meeting.

12 

lease, pledge, security interest, encumbrance, gift, grant of any interest, or transfer by operation of law. 

 (b) Each certificate or other instrument representing shares of the Corporation s stock shall have a legend stamped or typed across the face or on the reverse side substantially in the following form:

Article 10 Indemnification 10.1	 Other Rights; Continuation of Right to Indemnification . The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any director, officer, Advisory Member, employee or agent seeking indemnification may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement, vote of Shareholders, Board or any Executive Committee or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office or while employed by or acting as agent for the Corporation. The indemnification rights in this Article shall continue after a person has ceased to be director, officer, Advisory Member, employee, or agent, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors, and administrators of such person. All rights to indemnification under this Article shall be deemed a contract between the Corporation and each director, officer, Advisory Member, employee, or agent of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article is in effect. This Article is binding upon any successor corporation to this Corporation, whether by way of acquisition, merger, consolidation or otherwise. 10.2	 Indemnification of Directors, Executive Officers, and Advisory Members . The Corporation shall indemnify its directors, executive officers and Advisory Members to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Act or any other applicable law; provided, however, that the Corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its 

 14 

directors and executive officers; and, provided, further, that the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify any director or executive officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless: (a) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law;, (b) the proceeding was authorized by the Board or any Executive Committee, (c) such indemnification is provided by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, under the powers vested in the Corporation under the Act or any other applicable law or (d) such indemnification is required to be made under Section 10.5. 10.3	 Indemnification of Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents . The Corporation may indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the Act or any other applicable law. The Board or any Executive Committee shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person except executive officers to such officers or other persons as the Board or any Executive Committee determines. 10.4	 Advancement of Expenses . If the Corporation is obligated to provide indemnification under Section 10.2 or 10.3, the Corporation shall advance expenses incurred by an indemnitee in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding, including any appeal (a Proceeding before final disposition of such Proceeding if the Corporation determines that the indemnitee will more likely than not be able to demonstrate compliance with the standard of conduct set forth under the Act and receives an undertaking by the indemnitee to repay amounts advanced if such person is ultimately determined to be not entitled to indemnification. The determination referred to in the prior sentence shall be made by the disinterested members of the Board or Executive Committee, a committee appointed by the Board or Executive Committee, or special legal counsel specifically retained for the making of the determination. 10.5	 Procedure for Indemnification . The Corporation shall promptly pay any indemnification authorized under Section 10.2 or 10.3, and in any event within 60 days after the written request of the indemnitee and the receipt of any required undertakings required by Section 10.4. An indemnitee may enforce his or her right to indemnification or advances if authorized by this Article in any court of competent jurisdiction or proper arbitral proceedings, if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition is made within 60 days. If the indemnitee is successful in establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such Proceeding, the Corporation shall indemnify such person s costs and expenses. It shall be a defense to any such Proceeding (other than a Proceeding brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses authorized under Section 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 where a required undertaking, if any, has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met a required standard of conduct, but the burden of proving the defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, Executive Committee, independent legal counsel and Shareholders) to have made a determination before the claimant commences an action alleging that indemnification is proper because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Act, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, Executive Committee, independent legal counsel and Shareholders) that the claimant has not met an applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 10.6	 Settlement . The Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify an indemnitee under Section 10.2 or 10.3 for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the Corporation s written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty, other liability, or admission by the indemnitee without the indemnitee s 

 15 

prior written consent. Neither the Corporation nor the indemnitee will unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement. If the indemnitee unreasonably fails to enter into a settlement, then, notwithstanding any other provision, the Corporation s indemnification obligation to the indemnitee shall not exceed the total of the amount at which settlement could have been made and the expense incurred by the indemnitee before the time the settlement could have been made. 10.7	 Insurance . The Corporation shall purchase and maintain insurance, if reasonably available, on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director, executive officer or Advisory Member, or any director, executive officer or Advisory Member who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, regardless of whether the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become an officer (other than an executive officer), employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as an officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, regardless of whether the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article. 10.8	 Indemnification of Fiduciaries . For the purposes of determining the rights to indemnification of employees who are determined by the Corporation or otherwise to be or to have been fiduciaries of any employee benefit plan of the Corporation which may exist from time to time, the indemnification provisions under the Act and under this Article shall be interpreted as follows: (a) an other enterprise shall be deemed to include such an employee benefit plan, including any plan of the Corporation which is governed by the Act of Congress entitled Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 , as amended from time to time; (b) the Corporation shall be deemed to have requested a person to serve an employee benefit plan where the performance by such person of his or her duties to the Corporation also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; and (c) excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan under such Act of Congress shall be deemed fines . 10.9	 Savings Clause . If this Article or any portion is invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction or proper arbitral proceeding, then the Corporation may nevertheless indemnify each indemnitee, as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fine and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that has not been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law. 10.10	 Subsequent Amendment . No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article shall affect or impair in any way the rights of any authorized indemnitee to indemnification with respect to any Proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any actions, transactions or facts occurring before the final adoption of the amendment, termination, or appeal. 

 16 

10.11	 Subsequent Legislation .

The arbitrator s decision and award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award, and no one subject to this Article shall seek, an award of, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages, or any damages excluded by or in excess of any damage limitations expressed in these Bylaws or any subsequent agreement between the parties.

In the case of any Sale and Leaseback Transaction in which the lease is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty, such rental payments shall be considered for purposes of this definition to be the lesser of (a) the rental payments to be paid under such Sale and Leaseback Transaction until the first date (after the date of such determination) upon which it may be so terminated plus the then applicable penalty upon such termination and (b) the rental payments required to be paid during the remaining term of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction (assuming such termination provision is not exercised).

Bankruptcy Event means, with respect to any Person, that such Person becomes the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or has had a receiver, conservator, trustee, administrator, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar Person charged with the reorganization or liquidation of its business appointed for it, or, in the good faith determination of the Administrative Agent, has taken any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any such proceeding or appointment; provided that a Bankruptcy Event shall not result solely by virtue of any ownership interest, or the acquisition of any ownership interest, in such Person by a Governmental Authority, so long as such ownership interest does not result in or provide such Person with immunity from the jurisdiction of courts within the United States or from the enforcement of judgments or writs of attachment on its assets or permit such Person (or such Governmental Authority) to reject, repudiate, disavow or disaffirm any contracts or agreements made by such Person.

(l)	 Calculation of Maximum Stated Amount . For all purposes of this Agreement, the amount of a Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at the time of determination. (m)	 Existing Letters of Credit . On the Effective Date, each of the Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued as a Letter of Credit under this Agreement by the applicable Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have granted to each of the Lenders, and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have acquired from such Issuing Bank, a participation (on the terms specified in this Section 2.05 in each Existing Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof. Concurrently with such sale of participations, the participations granted pursuant to the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement to the lenders party thereto shall be automatically cancelled without further action by any of the parties hereto.

(a)	Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by written notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04 . The Administrative Agent will make Revolving Loans available to the Borrower by promptly remitting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. (b)	Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any SOFR Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 2.06 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the Loans comprising such Borrowing. If the Borrower and such Lender shall both pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. Section 2.07	 Interest Elections . (a)	Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a SOFR Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a SOFR Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.07 . The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section 2.07(a) shall not apply to Borrowings of Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued. 

 	 42 

(b)	To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.07 , the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone, fax or electronic mail by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, fax or electronic mail to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower. (c)	Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 : (i)	the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii)	the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day, and if the Borrower is electing to continue a SOFR Borrowing, shall be the last day of the immediately preceding Interest Period; (iii)	whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Revolving Borrowing or a SOFR Borrowing; and (iv)	if the resulting Borrowing is a SOFR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period . If any such Interest Election Request requests a SOFR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month s duration. (d)	Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e)	If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a SOFR Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Borrower, or if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, notifies the Borrower of the election to give effect to this sentence on account of such other Event of Default, then, in each such case, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a SOFR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each SOFR Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the closing of one or more securities offerings, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. Section 2.09	 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt . (a)	The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th day or the last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Borrowing of Revolving Loans is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.

 	 44 

(d)	The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section 2.09 shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e)	Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender (or its registered assigns) and substantially in the form of Exhibit D . Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04 be represented by one or more Notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or its registered assigns). Section 2.10	 Prepayment of Loans .

(b)	The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone, fax or electronic mail (and, in the case of telephonic notice, promptly confirmed by hand delivery, fax or electronic mail) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a SOFR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the same Business Day as the date of prepayment, or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the same Business Day as the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08 , then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08 . Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02 . Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 .

The applicable Adjusted Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(a)	Subject to Section 2.22 , if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any SOFR Loan: (i)	the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or (ii)	the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making and maintaining such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any 

 	 47 

obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert ABR Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (b) , at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans in the amount specified therein and (B) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.15 . Subject to Section 2.22 , if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on ABR Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Adjusted Reference Rate until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination. (b)	If any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR, then, upon prompt notice thereof by such Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an Illegality Notice ), (i) any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert ABR Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) the interest rate on which ABR Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Adjusted Reference Rate , in each case until each affected Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Loans to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Adjusted Reference Rate ), on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, in each case until the Administrative Agent and the Borrower are advised in writing by each affected Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.15 .

(b)	If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section 2.14 , the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered. The foregoing proviso, however, shall not require any Lender to disclose any confidential information regarding such other borrowers. (c)	A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.14 , including in reasonable detail a description of the basis for such claim for compensation and a calculation of such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to the Borrower (and both the description of the basis for such claim and the calculation of such amounts shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower). The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. 

 	 49 

(d)	Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower in writing of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further , that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold or deduct Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold or deduct and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, after such withholding or deduction has been made (including such withholding or deduction of Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section 2.16 ), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

The indemnity under this paragraph shall be paid within 30 days after the Recipient delivers to any Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent. (e)	 Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable and documented expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this paragraph shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document from any other source against any amount then due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph.

(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16(f) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding three sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set 

 	 51 

forth in subsections (ii) (A) through (E) and (iii) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii)	Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is a U.S. Person, any Lender shall, if it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies reasonably requested by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto, duly completed and executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable: (A)	in the case of a Lender that is a U.S. Person, IRS Form W 9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding Tax; (B)	in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (1) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (2) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; (C)	in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender for whom payments under any Loan Document constitute income that is effectively connected with such Lender s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, IRS Form W-8ECI; (D)	in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code both (1) IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E and (2) a certificate substantially in the form of the applicable certificate provided in Exhibit E (a U.S. Tax Certificate to the effect that such Lender is not (a) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (b) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, and (c) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code; (E)	in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not the beneficial owner of payments made under any Loan Document (including a partnership or a participating Lender) (1) an IRS Form W-8IMY on behalf of itself and (2) the relevant forms prescribed in clauses (A) , (B) , (C) , (D) and (F) of this paragraph (f) (ii) that would be required of each such beneficial owner or partner of such partnership if such beneficial owner or partner were a Lender; provided , however , that if the Lender is a partnership and one or more of its partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Certificate on behalf of such partners; or 

 	 52 

(F)	any other form prescribed by law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by law to be withheld. (iii)	If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16(f) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so. (g)	 Treatment of Certain Refunds . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.16 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16 ), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnifying party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place such indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 

 	 53 

(h)	 Status of Administrative Agent . On or before the date on which MUFG Bank, Ltd. (and any successor or replacement Administrative Agent) becomes the Administrative Agent hereunder, it shall deliver to the Borrower two duly executed originals of either (i) IRS Form W-9, or (ii) IRS Form W-8ECI with respect to any payments to be received on its own behalf and IRS Form W-8IMY (certifying that it is either a qualified intermediary within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(e)(5) that has assumed primary withholding obligations under the Code, including Chapters 3 and 4 of the Code, or a U.S. branch within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) that is treated as a U.S. person for purposes of withholding obligations under the Code) for the amounts the Administrative Agent receives for the account of others. The Administrative Agent (or, upon assignment or replacement, any assignee or successor) agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower in writing of its inability do so. (i)	 Issuing Bank . For purposes of Section 2.16(e) and 2.16(f) , the term Lender includes any Issuing Bank. (j)	 Significant Modification . The Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the standards set forth in Section 1.1001-6 of the Proposed United States Treasury Regulations (or any successor United States Treasury Regulations or other official IRS guidance promulgated that supersedes such Proposed United States Treasury Regulation that is substantially equivalent to the proposed regulations) or otherwise not cause a significant modification (and therefore an exchange) of any Loans for purposes of Section 1.1001-3 of the United States Treasury Regulations. Section 2.17	 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs . (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as provided in Section 2.05(e) , the Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14 , 2.15 or 2.16 , or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds. The Borrower shall make each reimbursement of LC Disbursements required to be made by it prior to the time for such payments set forth in Section 2.05(e) . Any amounts received after the time set forth above or in Section 2.05(e) , as applicable, on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to such account in the United States as it may specify from time to time, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14 , 2.15 , 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars. 

 	 54 

(b)	If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. (c)	If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including any payment made by the Borrower in connection with any extension of the Maturity Date in accordance with Section 2.20 or any Commitment Increase in accordance with Section 2.21 or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. (d)	Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 

 	 55 

(e)	If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c) , 2.05(d) or (e) , 2.06(b) , 2.17(d) or 8.07 , then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender s obligations to such Person under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. Section 2.18	 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . (a)	If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16 , as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense or would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b)	If (i) any Lender utilizes Section 2.13(b) , (ii) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.18(a) , (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (iv) any Lender refuses to consent to any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof that requires the unanimous approval of all Lenders, or the approval of each of the Lenders affected thereby (in each case in accordance with Section 9.02 ), and the consent of the Required Lenders shall have been obtained with respect to such amendment, modification, waiver or consent, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort (including payment of any applicable processing and recordation fees), upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04 ), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (A) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent with respect to any assignee that is not already a Lender hereunder (and if a Commitment or LC Exposure is being assigned, each Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (C) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payment of Indemnified Taxes pursuant to Section 2.16 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, (D) in the case of any such assignment resulting from the failure to provide a consent, the assignee shall have given such consent and, as a result of such assignment and any contemporaneous assignments and consents, the applicable amendment, modification, waiver or consent can be effected and (E) 

 	 56 

such assignment does not conflict with applicable law. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto (it being understood and agreed that such Lender shall not be deemed to make the representations and warranties in such Assignment and Assumption if such Lender has not executed such Assignment and Assumption). Section 2.19	 Defaulting Lenders . Notwithstanding any provision of any Loan Document to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the provisions set forth in the following paragraphs (a) through (e) shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: (a)	commitment fees shall cease to accrue on the unused portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a) ; (b)	the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders (or each Lender) or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02 ); provided that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification providing for an increase in such Defaulting Lender s Commitment, providing for an extension of such Defaulting Lender s Commitment (other than in determining whether the Required Lenders have consented to the extension of the Maturity Date under Section 2.20 or requiring the consent of each Lender affected thereby (including pursuant to Sections 9.02(b)(ii) and (iii) if such Defaulting Lender is an affected Lender; (c)	if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then: (i)	the Swingline Exposure (other than any portion thereof with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Section 2.04(c) and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender (other than any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Sections 2.05(d) and 2.05(e) shall be reallocated (effective as of the date such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (for the purposes of such reallocation, such Defaulting Lender s Commitment shall be disregarded in determining the Non-Defaulting Lenders respective Applicable Percentages), but only to the extent that (A) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments, (B) after giving effect to any such reallocation, no Non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed such non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment and (C) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time; 

 	 57 

(ii)	if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, within three Business Days following the Borrower s receipt of written notice from the Administrative Agent, (A) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure that has not been reallocated and (B) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Banks only the Borrower s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure that has not been reallocated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; (iii)	if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such portion of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure during the period such portion of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is cash collateralized; (iv)	if any portion of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then all Letter of Credit participation fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender s reallocated LC Exposure shall be payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages after giving effect to such reallocation; and (v)	if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit participation fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender s unreallocated LC Exposure shall be payable to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Banks, ratably based on the portion of such LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Bank, until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated or cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above; (d)	so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Bankruptcy Event with respect to any Lender Parent shall have occurred following the Effective Date and for so long as such Bankruptcy Event shall continue, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, or extend any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that either (i) the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender s then outstanding Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure, as applicable, will be 100 covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.19(c) , and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein) or (ii) the amount of any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit is reduced by the amount of the Defaulting Lender s related exposure; 

 	 58 

(e)	if the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposures and LC Exposures of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s Commitment, and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold Revolving Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage; and (f)	the rights and remedies against, and with respect to, a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.19 are in addition to, and cumulative and not in limitation of, all other rights and remedies that the Administrative Agent and each Lender, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party may at any time have against, or with respect to, such Defaulting Lender. Section 2.20	 Extension of Maturity Date . (a)	At any time at least 30 days prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrower, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, may request an extension of the Maturity Date to the date that is one year after the then existing Maturity Date (such existing Maturity Date, the Existing Maturity Date ). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall, in turn, in its sole discretion, not later than 20 days after delivery of such notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, notify the Administrative Agent in writing as to whether such Lender consents to such extension. If any Lender shall fail to notify the Administrative Agent in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the Maturity Date not later than 20 days after the delivery of such notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, such Lender shall be deemed to have not consented to such extension. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of the consents received with respect to the Borrower s request for an extension of the Maturity Date. The Maturity Date may be extended pursuant to this Section 2.20 on no more than two separate instances during the term of this Agreement. (b)	If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with Section 2.20(a) , the Maturity Date shall be extended to the date which is one year after the Existing Maturity Date as to those Lenders that so consented (each, an Extending Lender but shall not be extended as to any Non-Extending Lender; provided that no extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall become effective unless the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower, dated as of the date that would otherwise be the effective date of such extension, certifying that (i) as of and on such date, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of such date, except to the extent any such representations and warranties are expressly limited to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties continue to be true and correct in all material respects as of such specified earlier date provided that, in the case of clause (ii) above, such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof). To the extent that the Maturity Date is not extended as to any Non-Extending Lender pursuant to this Section 2.20 and the Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender is not assigned in accordance with Section 2.20(c) on or prior to the applicable Existing Maturity Date, (A) the Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such Existing Maturity Date without any further notice or other action by the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person and (B) the 

 	 59 

principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Non-Extending Lenders, together with any accrued interest thereon and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Non-Extending Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on such Existing Maturity Date, and on such Existing Maturity Date the Borrower shall also make such other prepayments of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.10 as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, Non-Extending Lenders pursuant to this sentence, the Total Revolving Credit Exposure would not exceed the Aggregate Commitments; provided that such Non-Extending Lender s rights under Sections 2.14 , 2.15 , 2.16 and 9.03 , and its obligations under Section 9.03 , shall survive such Existing Maturity Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. It is understood and agreed that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the Borrower for any requested extension of the Maturity Date. (c)	If, pursuant to Section 2.20(a) , the Borrower requests an extension of the Maturity Date and Lenders constituting the Required Lenders consent to such request, then the Borrower may, at any time after the day that is 27 months prior to the Maturity Date in effect at such time, at its sole expense and effort (including payment of any applicable processing and recordation fees), require any Non-Extending Lender, promptly following notice to such Non-Extending Lender and the Administrative Agent, to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04 ), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee meeting the conditions set forth in Section 9.04(b) that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment) and will agree to the applicable request for extension; provided that (i) unless the assignee is already a Lender, the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) such Non-Extending Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law. (d)	If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders consent in writing to a requested extension of the Maturity Date, not later than one Business Day prior to the applicable Existing Maturity Date the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower, and the Existing Maturity Date then in effect shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the proviso in the first sentence of Section 2.20(b) , be extended for the additional one-year period as described in Section 2.20(b) , and all references in the Loan Documents to the Maturity Date shall, solely with respect to the Commitments and Revolving Credit Exposure of each Extending Lender and each assignee pursuant to Section 2.20(c) for such extension, refer to the Maturity Date as so extended. Promptly following the applicable Existing Maturity Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders (including each assignee pursuant to Section 2.20(c) of such extension of the applicable Existing Maturity Date and shall thereupon record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each such Extending Lender and each such assignee.

(e)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Availability Period and the Maturity Date (without taking into consideration any extension pursuant to this Section), as such terms are used in reference to any Issuing Bank or any Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender or any Swingline Loans made by the Swingline Lender, may not be extended without the prior written consent of such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as applicable (it being understood and agreed that, in the event any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender shall not have consented to any such extension, (i) such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, hereunder through the applicable Existing Maturity Date (or the Availability Period determined on the basis thereof, as applicable), and thereafter shall have no obligation to issue, amend, or extend any Letter of Credit or to make any Swingline Loan, as applicable (but shall, in each case, continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.04 , 2.05 , 2.14 , 2.15 and 9.03 , as applicable, as to Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans issued or made prior to such time), and (ii) the Borrower shall cause the Total LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and the Swingline Exposure to be zero no later than the day on which such Total LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, as applicable, would have been required to have been reduced to zero in accordance with the terms hereof without giving effect to any effectiveness of the extension of the applicable Existing Maturity Date pursuant to this Section (and, in any event, no later than the applicable Existing Maturity Date)).

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 9.04 . (iv)	The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount (and associated stated interest) of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ).

 	 97

Each assigning Lender and the assignee, by its execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption, shall be deemed to have represented to the Administrative Agent that all written consents required by this Section with respect thereto (other than the consent of the Administrative Agent) have been obtained and that such Assignment and Assumption is otherwise duly completed and in proper form, and each assignee, by its execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption, shall be deemed to have represented to the assigning Lender and the Administrative Agent that such assignee is eligible to be a Lender hereunder. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (c)	Any Lender may, without the consent of or notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than a natural person or holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof or any Defaulting Lender) (a Participant in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged; (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement.

The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14 , 2.15 and 2.16 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.16(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.16(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that (A) such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.17 and 2.18 as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to this paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) such Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 , with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. A Participant that fails to comply with the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to any of the benefits of Sections 2.14 , 2.15 and 2.16 . Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.18(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register ); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity 

 	 98 

of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the Borrower as provided above and to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Treasury Regulations Section 5f.103-1(c), proposed Treasury Regulation 1.163-5 or any applicable temporary, final or other successor regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (d)	Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. Section 9.05	 Survival . All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower and the other Loan Parties herein and in the other Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance, amendment, or extension of any Letters of Credit, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14 , 2.15 , 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

(c)	This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided that the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit hereunder are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by fax or electronic transmission (in .pdf form) shall be effective for all purposes as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Each party hereto agrees that any Electronic Signature or execution in the form of an Electronic Record shall be valid and binding on itself and each of the other parties hereto to the same extent as a manual, original signature.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent the Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature from any party hereto, the Administrative Agent and the other parties hereto shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of the executing party without 

 	 100 

further verification and (ii) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by an original manually executed counterpart thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby (A) agrees that, for all purposes, including without limitation, in connection with any workout, restructuring, enforcement of remedies, bankruptcy proceedings or litigation among the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any of the Credit Parties, electronic images of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (in each case, including with respect to any signature pages thereto) shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as any paper original, and (B) waives any argument, defense or right to contest the validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents based solely on the lack of paper original copies of any Loan Documents, including with respect to any signature pages thereto. Section 9.07	 Severability . Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

The rights of each Lender, each Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender, such Issuing Bank or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees to promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. Section 9.09	 Subsidiary Guaranties .

So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result from such release), (i) if all of the Equity Interests in a Guarantor that are owned by the Borrower or a Subsidiary are sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction or transactions permitted by this Agreement or (ii) if, immediately after giving effect to the release of any Guarantor s Subsidiary Guaranty, all of the Indebtedness of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries is permitted under Section 6.01 , then, in each case, promptly following the Borrower s request, the Administrative Agent shall execute a release of such Guarantor from its Subsidiary Guaranty.
