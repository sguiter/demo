 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Bath Body Works, Inc. 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bath Body Works, Inc. (the Company) as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and total equity (deficit) for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the consolidated statements of cash flows for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of February 3, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, total equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 22, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of February 3, 2024, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 We are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. Additional information regarding these and other factors can be found in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Executive Overview 
 In the third quarter of 2024, consolidated Net Sales were 1.610 billion, which increased 48 million, or 3.0 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. Total North American Net Sales increased 56 million, primarily due to new store growth and an approximately 200 basis point benefit from the shifted fiscal calendar resulting from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, partially offset by an 8 million decrease in International Net Sales. Our third quarter Operating Income was 218 million, which decreased 3 million, or 1 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, and our Operating Income rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) decreased to 13.5 from 14.1 . The Operating Income rate declined primarily due to incremental marketing investments to drive customer acquisition and strategically planned promotional activities, partially offset by the benefits of our cost optimization work discussed below. 
 For additional information related to our third quarter 2024 financial performance, see Results of Operations. 
 Cost Optimization 
 We are focused on enhancing our operational excellence and efficiency by targeting an aggregate of 300 million of planned annual cost savings across both Gross Profit and General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses, which is up 20 million from our previous expectations. We delivered approximately 150 million of annual cost reductions as part of this initiative in fiscal 2023, and now expect approximately 150 million in additional annual cost savings in fiscal 2024. Our cost optimization work delivered approximately 35 million and 115 million in cost savings in the third quarter of and year-to-date 2024, respectively. 
 Outlook 
 As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, the market remains competitive with a value conscious consumer. Our strategic priorities are focused on driving revenue growth through our core categories, supported by newness and innovation to create customer demand and convey the quality and value of our products. We are also focused on extending our reach by expanding and diversifying our product portfolio through category adjacencies, including men s, hair, lip, and laundry, and expansion of off-mall stores and international geographies. We are continuing to invest in marketing, loyalty and in foundational tools and systems enabling new capabilities that we believe will increase customer engagement and provide a more seamless and convenient cross-channel shopping experience. We also continue to focus on enhancing operational excellence and efficiency through the cost optimization discussed above, which will support our strategic priorities. 
 Adjusted Financial Information 
 In addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, provided below are non-GAAP measures that present Net Income and Net Income Per Diluted Share for the third quarters of and year-to-date 2024 and 2023 on an adjusted basis to remove certain items. We believe that these items are not indicative of our operations due to their size and nature. 
 We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definitions of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies.

 (a) Results include fulfilled buy online-pick up in store BOPIS orders. 
 (b) Results include royalties associated with franchised stores and wholesale sales. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, Net Sales increased 48 million, or 3.0 , to 1.610 billion, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Stores Net Sales increased 52 million, or 4.4 , due to new store growth, an increase in BOPIS fulfilled orders and the benefit of the shifted fiscal calendar, partially offset by the decline in average dollar sale. Direct Net Sales increased 4 million, or 1.5 , primarily driven by an increased average order size, partially offset by a decline in fulfilled orders, which was primarily due to our customers continuing to select our BOPIS option (which is recognized as store Net Sales). International Net Sales decreased 8 million, or 11.1 , driven by a decline in wholesale shipments to our franchise partners affected by the war in the Middle East. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, Net Sales benefited by approximately 200 basis points from the shifted fiscal calendar resulting from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. 
 Gross Profit 
 For the third quarter of 2024, our Gross Profit increased 18 million to 700 million, and our Gross Profit rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) decreased to 43.5 , from 43.6 in the third quarter of 2023. Gross Profit dollars increased due to an increase in Net Sales. 
 Gross Profit rate was about flat as category mix shifts drove both higher average unit retails and average unit costs. Gross Profit rate benefited from continued cost savings, offset by strategically planned promotional activities in the quarter. 
 General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses 
 The following table provides detail for our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023:

 For the third quarter of 2024, our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses increased 21 million to 482 million, and the rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) increased to 30.0 from 29.5 in the third quarter of 2023. Our Selling Expenses increased primarily due to increases in store count and associate wages, partially offset by the benefits of our cost optimization work. Increases in Marketing Expenses, primarily due to additional spend to drive customer acquisition, were partially offset by decreases in Home Office Expenses, primarily due to discrete corporate expenses in the prior year and benefits of our cost optimization work.

 Other Income and Expenses 
 Interest Expense 
 The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023: 
 2024 2023 Average daily borrowings (in millions) 4,230 4,658 Average borrowing rate 7.3 7.4 
 For the third quarter of 2024, our Interest Expense was 77 million, compared to 84 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was due to lower average daily borrowings which were driven by the repurchase and early extinguishment of outstanding notes and lower average borrowing rate. 
 Other Income 
 For the third quarter of 2024, our Other Income was 4 million, compared to 22 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 12 million pre-tax gain on the repurchase and early extinguishments of outstanding notes in the third quarter of 2023 and lower interest income on invested cash in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 For the third quarter of 2024, our effective tax rate was 26.7 compared to 25.3 in the third quarter of 2023. The 2024 third quarter rate was higher than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates primarily due to accrued interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits. The 2023 third quarter rate was consistent with our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates.

Direct Net Sales decreased 47 million, or 5.0 , driven by a decline in fulfilled orders, which was primarily due to our customers continuing to select our BOPIS option (which is recognized as store Net Sales), partially offset by an increased average order size. We completed our rollout of BOPIS capabilities to our U.S. stores in the first quarter of 2023. International Net Sales decreased 30 million, or 12.5 , driven by a decline in wholesale shipments to our franchise partners affected by the war in the Middle East.

 2024 2023 Average daily borrowings (in millions) 4,291 4,774 Average borrowing rate 7.3 7.3 
 For year-to-date 2024, our Interest Expense was 236 million, compared to 259 million for year-to-date 2023. The decrease was due to lower average daily borrowings, which were driven by the repurchase and early extinguishment of outstanding notes. 
 Other Income 
 For year-to-date 2024, our Other Income was 65 million, compared to 68 million for year-to-date 2023. Included in year-to-date 2024 is a 39 million pre-tax gain on sales of certain Easton investments in the second quarter of 2024 and the recognition of a 3 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of outstanding notes. Included in year-to-date 2023 is a 28 million pre-tax gain on the repurchase and early extinguishments of outstanding notes. The remaining difference in Other Income between the periods was primarily due to lower interest income on invested cash during the year-to-date 2024. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 For year-to-date 2024, our effective tax rate was 17.2 compared to 24.9 for year-to-date 2023. The 2024 year-to-date rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the sales of Easton investments during the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset. The 2023 year-to-date rate was consistent with our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements, future common stock and debt repurchases, and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income and working capital changes. Our net income is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions and product and market expansions, profit margins, income taxes and inflationary pressures. Our sales are highest during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were 47 million as of November 2, 2024. 
 We repurchased and extinguished 200 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for an aggregate price of 202 million during year-to-date 2024. Additionally, we repurchased 8.963 million shares of our common stock for 348 million during year-to-date 2024. We may, from time to time, repurchase, or otherwise retire, additional debt or shares of our common stock, as applicable. 
 We believe that our current cash position, our cash flows generated from operations and our borrowing capacity under our asset-backed revolving credit facility ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including capital expenditure requirements, for at least the next twelve months. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity during year-to-date 2024 and 2023: 
 2024 2023 (in millions) Cash and Cash Equivalents, Beginning of Year 1,084 1,232 Net Cash Flows (Used for) Provided by Operating Activities (69) 28 Net Cash Flows Used for Investing Activities (114) (239) Net Cash Flows Used for Financing Activities (710) (609) Net Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents (893) (820) Cash and Cash Equivalents, End of Period 191 412 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used for operating activities for year-to-date 2024 was 69 million, including net income of 345 million. Net income included depreciation of 211 million, impacts to deferred income taxes of 103 million, an aggregate pre-tax gain on sales of certain Easton investments of 39 million, and share-based compensation expense of 31 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal changes in Inventories (and related increases in Accounts Payable) as we build our inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, which generates a substantial portion of our operating cash flow for the year, and Income Taxes Payable, due to seasonal tax payments. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for year-to-date 2023 was 28 million, including net income of 299 million. Net income included depreciation of 199 million, share-based compensation expense of 29 million and pre-tax gains on extinguishment of debt of 28 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal changes in Inventories (and related increases in Accounts Payable), as we build our inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, which generates a substantial portion of our operating cash flow for the year, and Income Taxes Payable due to seasonal tax payments. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities for year-to-date 2024 was 114 million primarily related to capital expenditures of 166 million, partially offset by aggregate cash proceeds, net of fees, of 40 million related to the sales of certain Easton investments. The capital expenditures included approximately 115 million related to new, primarily off-mall, stores and remodels of existing stores, approximately 30 million for various IT projects primarily to support the growth and profitability of our business, and approximately 20 million related to distribution and logistics capabilities.

Table of Contents 

 Net cash used for investing activities for year-to-date 2023 was 239 million, primarily related to capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included approximately 125 million related to new, off-mall stores and remodels of existing stores, approximately 75 million for various IT projects primarily supporting the separation of our IT systems from Victoria s Secret and approximately 35 million related to distribution and logistics capabilities. 
 In 2024, our top priority remains driving sustainable, long-term, profitable growth through investments in the business. To support this, we are planning investments totaling approximately 250 million during the year, the vast majority of which will be reported as capital expenditures, and our priorities remain investments in brick-and-mortar stores and in technology. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities for year-to-date 2024 was 710 million, primarily consisting of 349 million for share repurchases, 202 million for open market debt repurchases, dividend payments of 0.60 per share, or 134 million, and 16 million of tax payments related to share-based awards.

 Asset-backed Revolving Credit Facility 
 We and certain of our 100 owned subsidiaries guarantee and pledge collateral to secure the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility, which allows borrowings and letters of credit in U.S. dollars, has aggregate commitments of 750 million and an expiration date in August 2026. 
 Availability under the ABL Facility is the lesser of (i) the borrowing base, determined primarily based on our eligible U.S. and Canadian credit card receivables, accounts receivable, inventory and eligible real property, or (ii) the aggregate commitment. If at any time the outstanding amount under the ABL Facility exceeds the lesser of (i) the borrowing base and (ii) the aggregate commitment, we are required to repay the outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility to the extent of such excess. As of November 2, 2024, our borrowing base was 1.123 billion, and we had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. 
 The ABL Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had 10 million of outstanding letters of credit as of November 2, 2024 that reduced our availability under the ABL Facility. As of November 2, 2024, our availability under the ABL Facility was 740 million. 
 As of November 2, 2024, the ABL Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts were 0.30 per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit were 1.25 per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings was the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25 and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 per annum. 
 The ABL Facility requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 during an event of default or any period commencing on any day when specified excess availability is less than the greater of (i) 70 million or (ii) 10 of the maximum borrowing amount. As of November 2, 2024, we were not required to maintain this ratio.

 The following table provides our credit ratings as of November 2, 2024:

 Guarantor Summarized Financial Information 
 Certain of our subsidiaries, which are listed on Exhibit 22 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have guaranteed our obligations under the 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2029 Notes, 2030 Notes, 2035 Notes and 2036 Notes (collectively, the Notes ). 
 The Notes have been issued by Bath Body Works, Inc. (the Parent Company ). The Notes are its senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured obligations, are senior to any of our future subordinated indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is secured by a lien and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of each of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including certain subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations under our ABL Facility (such guarantees, the Guarantees and, such guaranteeing subsidiaries, the Subsidiary Guarantors ). The Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. Each Guarantee is limited, by its terms, to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. 
 The following tables set forth summarized financial information for the Parent Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Parent Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and (ii) investments in and equity in the earnings of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

 Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations 
 Lease Guarantees 
 In connection with the spin-off of Victoria s Secret Co. and the disposal of a certain other business, we had remaining contingent obligations of 248 million as of November 2, 2024 related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases, primarily related to office space, expiring at various dates through 2037. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of these businesses. Our reserves related to these obligations were not significant for any period presented. 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 Contractual Obligations 
 Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and the related interest payments, operating leases, purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other long-term obligations. These contractual obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Other than the repurchase of 200 million principal amounts of our outstanding senior notes during year-to-date 2024, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations subsequent to February 3, 2024, as discussed in Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of our contractual obligations may fluctuate during the normal course of business (primarily changes in our merchandise inventory-related purchase obligations which fluctuate throughout the year as a result of the seasonal nature of our business). 
 
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , that expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance, and applies to companies with a single reportable segment. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are finalizing our assessment of the impact of adopting this standard and expect to have additional disclosures in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , that requires enhanced income tax disclosures, primarily related to standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures. 
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , that requires disclosures of disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items on an annual and interim basis. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted, and will be applied prospectively, with the option to apply retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, valuation of long-lived store assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition, including revenue associated with our loyalty program. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk 
 The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
 Our Canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in Canada is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. Although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with our operations in Canada, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates. 
 Further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in U.S. dollars, the royalties we receive in U.S. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. As a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. Our investment portfolio is primarily composed of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. Given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates. 
 All of our outstanding debt as of November 2, 2024 has fixed interest rates. We will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. Our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of our outstanding debt as of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023: November 2, 2024 February 3, 2024 October 28, 2023 (in millions) Principal Value 4,230 4,430 4,542 Fair Value, Estimated (a) 4,273 4,456 4,122 _______________ 
 (a) The estimated fair values are based on reported transaction prices and are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. 
 As of November 2, 2024, we believe that the carrying values of our Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses approximate their fair values because of their short maturities. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 We maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. We monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Our investment portfolio is primarily composed of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. We also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Actions filed against the Company from time to time may include commercial, tort, intellectual property, tax, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, our current legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act Cases 
 We were named as a defendant in two putative class actions: Smidga, et al. v. Bath Body Works, LLC in the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas and Dahlin v. Bath Body Works, LLC in the Santa Barbara County, California Superior Court. The complaints each alleged that we violated the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act by printing more than the last five digits of credit or debit card numbers on customers receipts and, among other things, sought statutory damages, attorneys fees and costs. We reached an agreement with the plaintiffs in these cases that resolves both matters. The cases were consolidated in the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, which issued final approval of the settlement on October 24, 2024. The resolution of these claims had no material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We wish to caution the reader that the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and those described elsewhere in this report or other SEC filings could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated in any forward-looking statements.
