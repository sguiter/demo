General Overview 

We are engaged in seeking business partnership opportunities with companies
that are in the field of exploration and extraction of precious and/or base metals, primarily in China, which are in need of funding and
improved management. We would provide the necessary management expertise and assist in financing efforts of these mining operations. In
exchange, we would acquire metal ores produced by these mines, process the ores in our ore milling plant, and sell the ore concentrates
to metal refineries. Our only operating company is Zhen Ding JV, which engages in the processing of metal ore and the selling
of ore concentrates of gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper at purity levels ranging from 65 to 80 . Zhen Ding JV purchases
metal ore in rock form from its joint venture partner, Xinzhou Gold, which has rights to explore and mine ore from a property located
in the southwestern part of Anhui province in China. 

Our Corporate History and Structure 

Our principal office is located at Suite 111,
3900 Place De Java, Second Floor, Brossard, Quebec, Canada J4Y 9C4. Our operational offices are located at: Zhen Ding
Mining Co. Ltd., Wuxi County, Town of Langqiao, Jing Xian, Anhui Province, China, Tel: 86-6270-9018. 

We were incorporated in September 1996 as Robotech
Inc., and began our business in the development and marketing of specialized technological equipment. At that time we estimated that we
would require approximately 6,000,000 to realize our plans. Through the year of 2003, we had not reached our financing goals and therefore
abandoned that particular business plan. Since that time, we have been seeking suitable candidates for acquisition. 

In the past decade there has been a worldwide
recovery in the price and interest in precious metals, minerals and industrial commodities. Such interest has been fueled to a large degree,
by the economic awakening of the two most populous nations, China and India and further bolstered by a sharp decline in the US dollar.
A particular beneficiary of this revival has been the market prices of gold, silver and copper. Thus, in early 2010, the business direction
of our company was changed to seek to profit from this revival and we began to focus our acquisition search in that industry, particularly
on companies engaged in the mining of gold, silver and copper. 

In January 2012, our Board of Directors, with
authorization from a majority of our shareholders, made an offer to the shareholders of Zhen Ding Resources Inc., a Nevada corporation Zhen Ding NV ), to acquire, at the very least, the majority of their common shares, and, if available, up to 100 ownership.

 Table of Contents 

Zhen Ding NV through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Z W Zhen Ding Corporation, a California corporation Zhen Ding CA ), has been engaged in a joint venture with Jing Xian
Xinzhou Gold Co., Ltd. Xinzhou Gold ), a company organized under the laws of the People s Republic of China PRC ).
The joint venture company, Zhen Ding Mining Co. Ltd. Zhen Ding JV is 70 held by Zhen Ding NV through Zhen Ding CA. It
is a common practice in China to append the name of the town or city where an enterprise is located to its legally incorporated name.
Thus many documents referencing Zhen Ding JV may refer to it as Jing Xian Zhen Ding Mining Co. Ltd. Zhen Ding JV engages in the processing
of metal ore and the selling of ore concentrates of gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper at purity levels ranging from 65 to 80 . Zhen
Ding JV purchases metal ore in rock form from Xinzhou Gold. 

On March 8, 2012, we changed our name from Robotech,
Inc. to Zhen Ding Resources Inc., in anticipation of the acquisition of Zhen Ding NV. Our trading symbol, RBTK, however remained unchanged. 

During 2012, a total of 50,746,358 shares of the
issued and outstanding common stock of Zhen Ding NV were tendered to our company. On August 13, 2013, an additional 13,100,000 shares
were tendered to us. Thus, as of August 13, 2013 the shareholders of Zhen Ding NV had tendered 100 of the issued and outstanding shares
of common stock, representing 100 of the issued and outstanding equity of Zhen Ding NV to us. 

On October 23, 2013, we issued 122,440 shares
of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis, to the tendering shareholders of Zhen Ding NV making Zhen Ding NV a wholly owned subsidiary
of our company. 

On October 28, 2013, we dissolved Zhen Ding NV
by merging it with and into Zhen Ding DE. As a result, Zhen Ding CA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zhen Ding DE. Zhen
Ding CA continues to exist as an intermediate holding company with no operations of its own, but which in turn owns our 70 interest in
Zhen Ding JV.

Our Current Business 

Background 

Presently, we conduct our operations exclusively
through Zhen Ding JV, our joint venture company. However, we continue to look for other attractive potential acquisition targets in the
mining industry. 

Our joint venture, Zhen Ding JV, is equipped to
process ore mined by our joint venture partner Xinzhou Gold when in operation. Zhen Ding JV purchases the ore in rock form
from Xinzhou Gold and processes the ore into our final product, which is a gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper ore concentrate. We estimate
that our processed product is 65 to 80 pure. The product is then sold to refineries which further purify and separate the concentrate. Zhen
Ding JV also arranges all exploration, mining process and operations, and financial and administrative support for Xinzhou Gold s
mine, known as the Wuxi Gold Mine. 

We purchase all of our raw material from Xinzhou
Gold for our ore processing operation and rely solely on Xinzhou Gold for our supply of ores. The veins most recently excavated by Xinzhou
Gold in the permitted areas of our mines are very low grade and, as such, the production is minimal. The higher yielding and therefore
more profitable veins run outside Xinzhou Gold s permitted mining area boundaries under its current license. 

Xinzhou Gold applied for an extension of the permitted
mining area, however, the application was rejected by the government in December 2016 due to Xinzhou Gold s insufficient working
capital. Xinzhou Gold intends to reapply for an extension of the permitted mining area when it is able to demonstrate sufficient working
capital to drill the extended area. However, if sufficient working capital is unavailable, or should the application be denied on other
grounds, we would not be able to secure another source with higher grade ores for our processing plant, which would severely limit our
ability to execute our plan of operation and our potential profitability. 

At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we idled our
mineral processing plant due to an overall downturn in the demand and market prices for our concentrates. This downturn coincided with
an overall economic recession in China and downturn in the global commodities market during fiscal 2015 through 2016. 

Recent Activities 

Since idling our mineral processing plant, we
have actively sought an investment of between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000, which we believe is required to expand Xinzhou Gold s mining
permit, and which would allow us to resume our ore extraction and refinery activities. However, as at the date of this report we have
not successfully secured any financing commitment. 

Due to our continued inability to raise sufficient
financing to expand Xinzhou Gold s mining permit, Xinzhou Gold elected to reapply for a new drilling permit based on a scaled-down
drilling plan. The resulting new permit application, which was submitted to the Anhui Province Land Resources Bureau for approval
on March 8, 2017, sought renewed permission to continue drilling in the areas directly adjacent to our concentration plant. That
application was subsequently rejected due to environmental concerns regarding wastewater runoff onto nearby agricultural lands. Accordingly,
during the last six months of fiscal 2019, the Company was primarily devoted to refining its environmental impact compliance proposal
and design in consultation with government officials. A new proposal and design was submitted to the environmental protection authorities
on June 30, 2019. 

During the fall of 2019, the Zhen Ding JV received
feedback from the Land Resource Bureau regarding its June 30, 2019 proposal and design submission. The authorities requested certain
improvements to the tailing pond and wastewater treatment facility on the proposed drilling site as a condition of granting any new drilling
permit. Zhen Ding JV subsequently retained a new environmental expert to re-design the tailing pond treatment facility. The new design
would employ automated pumping systems to optimize water transfer while lowering both cost and risk. The design affords immediate control
of pressure and flowrate, as well as real-time monitoring of pump speed, flowrate, inlet/outlet water pressures, water temperature, engine
performance, and engine fuel level. The improved water treatment design report was submitted to the government in December 2019 with an
estimated budget of approximately 1.75 million over two years. The Company expected a ruling on the new proposal in March 2020, however
the ruling was delayed due to COVID-19 containment measures in Anhui province which resulted in reduced staffing and operations across
all levels of the public service. More recently, the Company was advised that no ruling would be provided on the proposal without additional
3 rd party geo-technical research to support the viability of the Company s design. The estimated cost of such additional
research is 500,000. 

Financing and Restructuring Efforts 

During fiscal 2019 management entered into negotiations
with various related party lenders regarding a possible restructuring or conversion of related party debt. Effective December 14, 2020,
we issued an aggregate of 46,442,550 shares of our common stock to ten lenders at the price of 0.02 per share in consideration for the
cancellation of 928,851 of interest bearing debt payable on demand to the lenders in respect of cash advances made by them to the Company.

 Table of Contents 

Additionally, in light of robust gold prices during
2023 and 2024, management has been entertaining proposals from prospective investors and partners seeking to participate in a smaller
drilling operation and other joint venture projects and transactions. 

Going forward, we will continue to seek sufficient
financing to re-establish our mineral extraction and refining operations. We will also seek to identify and evaluation businesses opportunities
and other strategic transactions on an ongoing basis with a view toward diversifying our business and optimizing shareholder value. 

Summary of Operations during the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2024 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company
received a six year exploration permit for the Wuxi Gold Mine. The exploration area delineated by the permit is substantially the same
as the area previously explored and mined by the Company. 

In light of the continued strength of gold prices
during the first six months of 2024, our management continues to seek proposals from prospective investors and partners seeking to participate
in a smaller drilling operation and other joint venture projects and transactions. However, there is no assurance that a suitable opportunity
will be identified or secured. 

Going forward, we will continue to seek sufficient
financing to re-establish our mineral extraction and refining operations. We will also seek to identify and evaluation businesses opportunities
and other strategic transactions on an ongoing basis with a view toward diversifying our business and optimizing shareholder value. 

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

We did not earn any revenues in the three months ended September 30,
2024 or September 30, 2023. Our lack of revenue was due to the continued idling of our mineral processing operations and our inability
to secure a renewed permit or financing to resume our mining activities . 

We had a net loss of 171,120 from operations
for the three month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to net loss of 816,310 from operations for the three month period ended
September 30, 2023, due to issuance of stock based compensation during the period. 

The following table summarizes key items of comparison
and their related increase (decrease) for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the Nine Months Ended September, 2023 

We did not earn any revenues in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. Our lack of revenue was due to the continued idling of our mineral processing operations
and our inability to secure a renewed permit or financing to resume our mining activities.

 Table of Contents 

We had a net loss of 460,935 for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2024, which was 58.45 less than the net loss of 1,109,367 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The
change in our results over the two periods is a result of cost cutting measures and an absence of stock based compensation during the
most recent period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 reflects
current assets of 6,613 and a working capital deficit of 11,193,936. Our current assets consisted entirely of cash. We have insufficient
working capital to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 75,037, a 14.53 increase from the 65,513 net cash outflow during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase was a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities owed to related parties. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 we had no sales and did not purchase any raw materials.

 Table of Contents 

Financing Activities 

Cash provided by financing activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 92,500, which was a 71.77 increase from the 53,850 in cash provided by financing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided was
a result of an increase in related party loans during the fiscal 2024. 

Plan of Operation 

Our operating plan for the 12 months beginning
October 1, 2024 is as follows: 

Our operating plan for the balance of fiscal 2023
is to seek an investment of approximately US 3,350,000, which we believe is required to restart our mineral processing plant in China
and extend Xinzhou Gold s mining permit, which would allow us to resume our ore extraction and refinery activities, although we
have not secured any financing commitment thus far. 

The funds raised would be used to: 

1. upgrade tailings pond and water treatment facility; 

2. extend and expand permitted mining area of Xinzhou Gold to access higher concentrate ore veins; 

3. resume ore exploration and extraction activities; 

4. re-start the mill; 

5. re-test the mill; 

6. develop expansion plans for our plant capacity; 

7. drill additional holes near the concentration plant; and 

8. undertake at least three deep drill holes in the permitted area to re-commence greater milling operations as soon as possible. 

This will involve re-testing the plant equipment
and re-hiring all personnel that was laid off as a result of the mining halt. We will reactively seek partnerships with mining enterprises
primarily active in the gold, silver and/or copper fields and subject to the general parameters described earlier to increase our supply
of raw material. In addition, we will look for a partner in the natural resources field in order to enhance our future capability to access
necessary funding and seek other businesses opportunities and other strategic transactions with a view toward diversifying our business
and attracting new investment. 

In order to execute our business plan over the
next twelve months we expect to expend funds as follows: 

Estimated Net Expenditures During the Next
Twelve Months 

Restart mill and mining related operations 
 
 3,000,000 
 
 General, Administrative Expenses 
 
 100,000 
 
 Consulting Permit Fees 
 
 150,000 
 
 Misc 
 
 100,000 

Total 
 
 3,350,000 

In light of our nominal cash resources, we expect
that we will be required to raise approximately 3,500,000 in order to execute our proposed business plan during fiscal 2024. In
the event that we are unable to raise sufficient funds to carry out our planned investment in drilling equipment and our planned exploration
program, we anticipate that we will require a minimum of 350,000 to maintain our current business operations without engaging in any
significant exploration activities or investment. We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is
dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. 

20 

 Table of Contents 

The continuation of our business is dependent
upon obtaining further financing, a successful program of exploration and/or development, and, finally, achieving a profitable level of
operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current
stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. 

There are no assurances that we will be able to
obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our
immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed
or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a
timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become
due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. We are not aware of any known trends, demands,
commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing
in any material way. 

Future Financings 

We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales
of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our
existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or
other financing to fund our planned business activities. 

We presently do not have any arrangements for
additional financing for the expansion of our exploration operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently
available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions 

The Company prepares its financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Foreign Currency Adjustments 

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies
are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing
during the year. Any translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity (deficit) and have no
effect on current earnings. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in current results of operations.
During the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had aggregate foreign currency translation gains (loss) of 17,143 and
 6,332, respectively. 

Non-controlling Interests 

Non-controlling interests in the Company s subsidiaries are reported
as a component of equity, separate from the Company s equity. Purchase or sale of equity interests that do not result in a change
of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Results of operations attributable to the minority interest are included in our condensed
consolidated results of operations and, upon loss of control, the interest sold, as well as interest retained, if any, will be reported
at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. 

21 

 Table of Contents 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue is recognized when products are shipped,
title and risk of loss is passed to the customers and collection is reasonably assured. Payments received prior to the satisfaction of
above criteria are deferred. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company ,
we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Report on Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president
(our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to
allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the quarter covered by this report, we carried out
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial
officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our management concluded that our internal controls are not effective due to us having
material weaknesses in our control environment and financial reporting process due to lack of a functioning audit committee, a majority
of independent members and a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal control and procedures. 

C hanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the period covered by this report there were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against
our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any
of our directors, executive officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material
interest adverse to our interest. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to
provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

None.
