 Defined terms used in this Report: 
 
 Annualized Rent Annualized cash base rent (excludes tenant reimbursements, parking and other revenue) before abatements under leases commenced as of the reporting date and expiring after the reporting date. Annualized Rent for our triple net office properties (in Honolulu and one single tenant building in Los Angeles) is calculated by adding expense reimbursements and estimates of normal building expenses paid by tenants to base rent. Annualized Rent does not include lost rent recovered from insurance and rent for building management use. Annualized Rent includes rent for our corporate headquarters in Santa Monica. We report Annualized Rent because it is a widely reported measure of the performance of equity REITs, and is used by some investors as a means to determine tenant demand and to compare our performance and value with other REITs. We use Annualized Rent to manage and monitor the performance of our office and multifamily portfolios. Consolidated Portfolio Includes all of the properties included in our consolidated results, including our consolidated JVs. Funds From Operations (FFO) We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT by excluding gains (or losses) on sales of investments in real estate, gains (or losses) from changes in control of investments in real estate, real estate depreciation and amortization (other than amortization of right-of-use assets for which we are the lessee and amortization of deferred loan costs), impairment write-downs of real estate and impairment write-downs of our investment in our unconsolidated Fund from our net income (loss) (including adjusting for the effect of such items attributable to our consolidated JVs and our unconsolidated Fund, but not for noncontrolling interests included in our Operating Partnership). FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that we report because we believe it is useful to our investors. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 2 of this Report for a discussion of FFO. Leased Rate The percentage leased as of the reporting date. Management space is considered leased. Space taken out of service during a repositioning or which is vacant as a result of a fire or other damage is excluded from both the numerator and denominator for calculating the Leased Rate. For newly developed buildings going through initial lease up, units are included in both the numerator and denominator as they are leased. We report Leased Rate because it is a widely reported measure of the performance of equity REITs, and is also used by some investors as a means to determine tenant demand and to compare our performance with other REITs. We use Leased Rate to manage and monitor the performance of our office and multifamily portfolios. 
 Net Operating Income (NOI) We calculate NOI as revenue less operating expenses attributable to the properties that we own and operate. NOI is calculated by excluding the following from our net income (loss): general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, other income, other expenses, income (loss) from unconsolidated Fund, interest expense, gains (or losses) on sales of investments in real estate and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. NOI is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that we report because we believe it is useful to our investors. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 2 of this Report for a discussion of our Same Property NOI. Occupancy Rate We calculate Occupancy Rate by excluding signed leases not yet commenced from the Leased Rate. Management space is considered occupied. Space taken out of service during a repositioning or which is vacant as a result of a fire or other damage is excluded from both the numerator and denominator for calculating the Occupancy Rate. For newly developed buildings going through initial lease up, units are included in both the numerator and denominator as they are occupied. We report Occupancy Rate because it is a widely reported measure of the performance of equity REITs, and is also used by some investors as a means to determine tenant demand and to compare our performance with other REITs. We use Occupancy Rate to manage and monitor the performance of our office and multifamily portfolios. 
 Recurring Capital Expenditures Building improvements required to maintain revenues once a property has been stabilized, and excludes capital expenditures for (i) acquired buildings being stabilized, (ii) newly developed space, (iii) upgrades to improve revenues or operating expenses or significantly change the use of the space, (iv) casualty damage and (v) bringing the property into compliance with governmental or lender requirements. We report Recurring Capital Expenditures because it is a widely reported measure of the performance of equity REITs, and is used by some investors as a means to determine our cash flow requirements and to compare our performance with other REITs. We use Recurring Capital Expenditures to manage and monitor the performance of our office and multifamily portfolios.

 Defined terms used in this Report (continued): 
 Rentable Square Feet Based on the BOMA remeasurement and consists of leased square feet (including square feet with respect to signed leases not commenced as of the reporting date), available square feet, building management use square feet and square feet of the BOMA adjustment on leased space. We report Rentable Square Feet because it is a widely reported measure of the performance and value of equity REITs, and is also used by some investors to compare our performance and value with other REITs. We use Rentable Square Feet to manage and monitor the performance of our office portfolio. Rental Rate We present two forms of Rental Rates - Cash Rental Rates and Straight-Line Rental Rates. Cash Rental Rate is calculated by dividing the rent paid by the Rentable Square Feet. Straight-Line Rental Rate is calculated by dividing the average rent over the lease term by the Rentable Square Feet. Same Properties Our consolidated properties that have been owned and operated by us in a consistent manner, and reported in our consolidated results during the entire span of both periods being compared. We exclude from our same property subset any properties that during the comparable periods were: (i) acquired, (ii) sold, held for sale, contributed or otherwise removed from our consolidated financial statements, (iii) that underwent a major repositioning project or were impacted by development activity, or suffered significant casualty loss that we believed significantly affected the properties' operating results. We also exclude rent received from ground leases. 
 Short-Term Leases Represents leases that expired on or before the reporting date or had a term of less than one year, including hold over tenancies, month to month leases and other short-term occupancies. Total Portfolio Includes our Consolidated Portfolio plus the properties owned by our Fund.

 Except as noted below, our loans: (i) are non-recourse, (ii) are secured by separate collateral pools consisting of or more properties, (iii) require interest-only monthly payments with the outstanding principal due upon maturity, and (iv) contain certain financial covenants which could require us to deposit excess cash flow with the lender under certain circumstances unless we (at our option) either provide a guarantee or additional collateral or pay down the loan within certain parameters set forth in the loan documents. Certain loans with maturity date extension options require us to meet minimum financial thresholds in order to extend the loan maturity date. 
 (1) Maturity dates include extension options. 
 (2) Effective rate as of September 30, 2024. Includes the effect of interest rate swaps (if applicable) and excludes the effect of prepaid loan fees and loan premiums. See Note 10 for details of our interest rate swaps. See further below for details of our loan costs and loan premiums. 
 (3) The loan agreement includes a -percent SOFR floor. If the loan is swap-fixed then the related swaps do not include such a floor. 
 (4) During September 2024, we paid the loan principal down by million in order to meet a minimum financial threshold to exercise an extension option. The related swaps expired during September 2024. 
 (5) The loan is secured by residential properties. A portion of the loan totaling million has a lender-required out-of-the-money interest rate cap at a weighted average of until July 2026 . For the portion of the loan relating to Barrington Plaza, in connection with the removal of that property from the rental market during 2023, t he lender is treating the debt as a construction loan and we signed a construction completion guarantee in January 2024. See "Guarantees" in Note 16. The lender also required a million cash deposit, which we placed into an interest bearing collateral account during 2023. The lender will return the deposit at the earlier of August 2026 or when the loan is paid in full. The deposit is included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7. 
 (6) The loan has a lender-required out-of-the-money interest rate cap at an interest rate of until August 2026. 
 (7) The loan requires monthly payments of principal and interest. The principal amortization is based upon a -year amortization schedule. 
 (8) We guaranteed the portion of the loan principal that would need to be paid down in order to meet the minimum debt yield in the loan agreement. See "Guarantees" in Note 16.

 Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 Our noncontrolling interests consist of interests in our Operating Partnership and consolidated JVs which are not owned by us. As of September 30, 2024, noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership owned million OP Units and fully-vested LTIP Units, which represented approximately of our Operating Partnership's total outstanding interests, and we owned million OP Units (to match our million shares of outstanding common stock), which represented approximately of our Operating Partnership's total outstanding interests. 
 
 A share of our common stock, an OP Unit and an LTIP Unit (once vested and booked up) have essentially the same economic characteristics, sharing equally in the distributions from our Operating Partnership. Investors who own OP Units have the right to cause our Operating Partnership to acquire their OP Units for an amount of cash per unit equal to the market value of share of our common stock at the date of acquisition, or, at our election, exchange their OP Units for shares of our common stock on a -for-one b asis. LTIP Units have been granted to our employees and non-employee directors as part of their compensation. These awards generally vest over a service period and once vested can generally be converted to OP Units provided our stock price increases by more than a specified hurdle.

The loan is secured by properties held by Partnership X and is non-recourse. 
 
 We have made certain environmental and other limited indemnities and guarantees covering customary non-recourse carve-outs for Partnership X's loan, and we have also guaranteed the related swaps. Partnership X has agreed to indemnify us for any amounts that we would be required to pay under these agreements. As of September 30, 2024, assuming that SOFR does not decrease below -percent, the maximum future interest payments for the swaps were million. As of September 30, 2024, all of the obligations under the related loan and swap agreements have been performed in accordance with the terms of those agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate the risk of loss for the various indemnities and guarantees to be low. See Note 6 for more information regarding Partnership X.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Forward Looking Statements disclaimer, and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our results of operations were impacted by various transactions - see "Debt and Equity Transactions, Development and Repositioning Projects, and Other Transactions" further below. 

Business Description 
 Douglas Emmett, Inc. is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT. Through our interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, our consolidated JVs and our unconsolidated Fund, we are one of the largest owners and operators of high-quality office and multifamily properties in Los Angeles County, California and in Honolulu, Hawaii. We focus on owning, acquiring, developing and managing a substantial market share of top-tier office properties and premier multifamily communities in neighborhoods that possess significant supply constraints, high-end executive housing and key lifestyle amenities. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of the following (including ancillary retail space and excluding two parcels of land from which we receive rent under ground leases): 
 Consolidated Portfolio (1) 
 Total Portfolio (2) 
 Office Class A Properties 68 70 Rentable Square Feet (in thousands) (3)

 Properties 14 14 Units 4,476 4,476 Leased rate 99.1 99.1 Occupancy rate 97.4 97.4 
 ______________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Our Consolidated Portfolio includes the properties in our consolidated results. Through our subsidiaries, we wholly-own 52 office properties totaling 13.4 million square feet and 12 residential properties with 4,006 apartments. Through four consolidated JVs, we partially own an additional 16 office properties totaling 4.2 million square feet and two residential properties with 470 apartments. Our Consolidated Portfolio excludes two wholly-owned land parcels from which we receive ground rent from ground leases to the owners of a Class A office building and a hotel. 
 (2) Our Total Portfolio includes our Consolidated Portfolio as well as two properties totaling 0.4 million square feet owned by our unconsolidated Fund, Partnership X. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information about Partnership X. 
 (3) As of September 30, 2024, we removed 67,000 Rentable Square Feet for an office building we are converting to apartments. See "Development" further below. 
 (4) Unit totals exclude units vacated as part of removing Barrington Plaza from the rental market. The leased and occupancy rates exclude Barrington Plaza. See "Property to be Removed from Service" further below. 
 
 Revenues by Segment and Location 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues from our Consolidated Portfolio were derived as follows:

 Debt and Equity Transactions, Development and Repositioning Projects, and Other Transactions 
 
 Debt and Equity Transactions 
 During the first quarter of 2024 : 
 We acquired an additional 20.2 of the equity in our unconsolidated Fund, Partnership X, which increased our ownership interest in the Fund to 74.0 . 
 We acquired 166 thousand OP Units in exchange for issuing an equal number of shares of our common stock to the holders of the OP Units. 
 We acquired 461 OP Units for 6 thousand in cash. 
 In connection with the Barrington Plaza loan, w e signed a construction completion guarantee. See "Property to be Removed from Service" further below for more information about Barrington Plaza. 
 During the second quarter of 2024 : 
 We acquired 27 thousand OP Units in exchange for issuing an equal number of shares of our common stock to the holders of the OP Units. 
 We acquired 703 OP Units for 10 thousand in cash. 
 During the third quarter of 2024 : 
 We acquired 20 thousand OP Units in exchange for issuing an equal number of shares of our common stock to the holders of the OP Units. 
 We acquired 6,798 OP Units for 105 thousand in cash. 
 Inte rest rate swaps, which fixed the interest rate on a 400 million interest-only, floating-rate loan that matures in September 2026 for one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, expired during September 2024, and the interest rate on the respective loan is now floating. W e also paid the respective loan principal down by 34.0 million in order to meet a minimum financial threshold to exercise an extension option. 
 See Notes 8, 10 and 11 to our consolidated financial stateme nts in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our debt, derivatives and equity, respectively. 
 Development 
 1132 Bishop Street, Honolulu, Hawaii - "The Residences at Bishop Place" 
 In downtown Honolulu, we are converting a 25-story, 493 thousand square foot office tower into 493 rental apartments. This project is helping to address the severe shortage of rental housing in Honolulu and revitalize the central business district, where we own a significant portion of the Class A office space. As of September 30, 2024, we had delivered 91 of the planned units and leased 98 of the units delivered. The conversion of the final two floors occupied by office tenants will continue as those floors are vacated. 
 Repositionings 
 We often strategically purchase properties with large vacancies or expected near-term lease roll-over and use our knowledge of the property and submarket to reposition the property for the optimal use and tenant mix. In addition, we may reposition properties already in our portfolio. The work we undertake to reposition a building typically takes months or even years, and could involve a range of improvements from a complete structural renovation to a targeted remodeling of selected spaces. During the repositioning, the affected property may display depressed rental revenue and occupancy levels that impact our results and, therefore, comparisons of our performance from period to period. 
 Property to be Removed from Service 
 During the second quarter of 2023, we removed our Barrington Plaza Apartments property in Los Angeles from the rental market. A reconstruction of this property is expected to take a number of years at a cost of several hundred million dollars. As of September 30, 2024, a significant majority of the tenants have vacated. See "Legal Proceedings" in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. During any period when the property is unoccupied, we will not generate any revenue from it. We accelerated and re corded additional depreciation expense of 27.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 54.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , which is included in Depreciation and amortization on our consolidated stateme nts of operations.

 Rental Rate Trends - Total Portfolio 
 
 Office Rental Rates 
 
 The table below presents the average annual rental rate per leased square foot and the annualized lease transaction costs per leased square foot for leases executed in our total office portfolio during the respective periods: 
 Nine Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Average straight-line rental rate (1)(2)(4)(5) 
 50.65 42.97 46.78 44.99 45.26 Annualized lease transaction costs (3)(4)(5) 
 6.05 5.53 5.85 4.77 5.11 
 ___________________________________________________ 
 (1) These average rental rates are not directly comparable from year to year because the averages are significantly affected from period to period by factors such as the buildings, submarkets, and types of space and terms involved in the leases executed during the respective reporting period. Because straight-line rent takes into account the full economic value during the full term of each lease, including rent concessions and escalations, we believe that it may provide a better comparison than ending cash rents, which include the impact of the annual escalations over the entire term of the lease. 
 (2) Reflects the weighted average straight-line Annualized Rent. 
 (3) Reflects the weighted average leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances divided by the weighted average number of years for the leases. Excludes leases substantially negotiated by the seller in the case of acquired properties, leases for tenants relocated from space at the landlord's request, and non-comparable leases, such as retail leases. 
 (4) Our office rental rates were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, 2021 and 2022, although the lower rental rates for the respective periods were partly offset by lower tenant improvement costs. 
 (5) Our office rental rates and lease transaction costs were impacted by a large tenant lease renewal during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 Office Rent Roll 
 
 The table below presents the rent roll for new and renewed leases per leased square foot executed in our total office portfolio: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Rent Roll (1)(2)(3) 
 Expiring 
 Rate (2) 
 New/Renewal Rate (2) 
 Percentage Change Cash Rent 51.19 48.57 (5.1) Straight-line Rent 45.35 50.65 11.7 
 ___________________________________________________ 
 (1) Represents the average annual initial stabilized cash and straight-line rents per square foot on new and renewed leases signed during the period compared to the prior leases for the same space. Excludes leases with a term of twelve months or less, leases where the prior lease was terminated more than a year before signing of the new lease, leases for tenants relocated at the landlord's request, leases in acquired buildings where we believe the information about the prior agreement is incomplete or where we believe the base rent reflects other off-market inducements to the tenant, and other non-comparable leases, such as retail leases. 
 (2) Our office rent roll can fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in our submarkets, buildings and term of the expiring leases, making these metrics difficult to predict. 
 (3) Our office cash rent and straight-line rent roll were impacted by a large tenant lease renewal during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 Multifamily Rental Rates 
 
 The table below presents the average annual rental rate per leased unit for new tenants: 
 Nine Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Average annual rental rate - new tenants (1)(2) 
 39,898 36,070 31,763 29,837 28,416 
 _____________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) These average rental rates are not directly comparable from year to year because of changes in the properties and units included. For example: 
 (i) During 2020, the average was impacted by the addition of a significant number of units at our Bishop Place development in Honolulu, where the rental rates were higher than the average in our portfolio, and 
 (ii) During 2022, the average was impacted by the acquisition of 1221 Ocean Avenue, where the rental rates were higher than the average in our portfolio. 
 (iii) During 2023, the average was impacted by leasing of units at our newly developed West Los Angeles property, where the rental rates were higher than the average in our portfolio. Barrington Plaza was removed from this metric beginning with the third quarter of 2023. 
 (iv) During the nine months ended, September 30, 2024, the average was impacted by leasing of units at our newly developed West Los Angeles property, where the rental rates were higher than the average in our portfolio. 
 (2) Our multifamily rental rates were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but improved in 2021 and 2022. 
 
 Multifamily Rent Roll 
 
 The rent on leases subject to rent change during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (new tenants and existing tenants undergoing annual rent review) was 2.9 higher on average than the prior rent on the same unit after adjusting for rent concessions.

 (1) Our office occupancy rates were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, 2021 and 2022. 
 (2) Our Occupancy Rates may not be directly comparable from year to year, as they can be impacted by acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment projects. Excludes units vacated as part of removing Barrington Plaza from the rental market until June of 2023 and excludes the impact of Barrington Plaza entirely starting in July 2023. 
 (3) Our multifamily occupancy rates were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 but recovered during 2021 and 2022. 
 (4) Average occupancy rates are calculated by averaging the occupancy rates at the end of each of the quarters in the period and at the end of the quarter immediately prior to the start of the period.

 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of three months ended September 30, 2024 to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Our operating results were adversely impacted by the effects of inflation and higher interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Office parking and other income 28,204 27,717 487 1.8 The increase was primarily due to an increase in ground rent income and higher parking income. Multifamily revenue 48,092 46,586 1,506 3.2 The increase was primarily due to: (i) an increase in revenues from new units at our Landmark Los Angeles development project and our Residences at Bishop Place conversion project, and (ii) higher rental rates, partly offset by (i) a decrease in revenues at our Barrington Plaza property, which we removed from service during the second quarter of 2023, and (ii) lower accretion from below-market leases. Operating expenses Office expenses 78,026 74,631 (3,395) (4.5) The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes, utility expenses and personnel expenses. Multifamily expenses 16,740 17,256 516 3.0 The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in multifamily expenses at our Barrington Plaza property, which we removed from service during the second quarter of 2023, and our Landmark Los Angeles development project. The decrease was partly offset by (i) an increase in multifamily expenses from new units at our Residences at Bishop Place conversion project and (ii) higher personnel expenses, utility expenses, insurance and property taxes at our other multifamily properties. General and administrative expenses 10,109 12,826 2,717 21.2 The decrease was primarily due to lower legal expenses, advocacy expenses and personnel expenses.

 Office rental revenue and tenant recoveries 515,252 535,243 (19,991) (3.7) The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rental revenues due to lower occupancy, and lower tenant recoveries. The lower tenant recoveries were primarily due to lower property taxes.

 Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: FFO 
 Usefulness to Investors 
 We report FFO because it is a widely reported measure of the performance of equity REITs, and is also used by some investors to identify the impact of trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs from year to year, excluding impacts from changes in the value of our real estate, and to compare our performance with other REITs. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure for which we believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. FFO has limitations as a measure of our performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate, and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a measure of our liquidity or cash flow, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to the FFO of other REITs. See "Results of Operations" above for a discussion of the items that impacted our net income. 
 FFO Reconciliation to GAAP 
 The table below reconciles our FFO (the FFO attributable to our common stockholders and noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership - which includes our share of our consolidated JVs and our unconsolidated Fund's FFO) to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (the most directly comparable GAAP measure). Our FFO was adversely impacted by the effects of inflation and higher interest rates during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 Comparison of three months ended September 30, 2024 to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, FFO decreased by 3.4 million, or 3.8 , to 86.0 million, compared to 89.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to: (i) lower office occupancy and tenant recoveries, (ii) higher office operating expenses, (iii) the removal of our Barrington Plaza property from service during the second quarter of 2023, and (iv) higher interest expense. The decrease was partly offset by (i) lower general and administrative expenses, (ii) higher interest income, (iii) new units from our multifamily development projects, and (iv) higher multifamily rental rates. 
 
 Comparison of nine months ended September 30, 2024 to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, FFO decreased by 16.3 million, or 5.7 , to 268.1 million, compared to 284.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to: (i) lower office occupancy and tenant recoveries, (ii) higher interest expense, and (iii) the removal of our Barrington Plaza property from service during the second quarter of 2023. The decrease was partly offset by (i) higher interest income, (ii) lower office property taxes, (iii) new units from our multifamily development projects, (iv) higher multifamily rental rates, and (v) lower general and administrative expenses.

 Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: Same Property NOI 
 
 Usefulness to Investors 
 
 We report Same Property NOI to facilitate a comparison of our operations between reported periods. Many investors use Same Property NOI to evaluate our operating performance and to compare our operating performance with other REITs, because it can reduce the impact of investing transactions on operating trends. Same Property NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure for which we believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We report Same Property NOI because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity REITs, and is used by some investors to identify trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs and to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. Same Property NOI has limitations as a measure of our performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization expense, and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations. Other REITs may not calculate Same Property NOI in the same manner. As a result, our Same Property NOI may not be comparable to the Same Property NOI of other REITs. Same Property NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a measure of our liquidity or cash flow, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Short-term liquidity 
 
 Our short-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary for our operating activities, development, repositioning projects, dividends, distributions and discretionary share repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash from operations of 334.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 544.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our debt maturities and interest rate swap expirations. Excluding acquisitions and debt refinancings, we expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through cash on hand and cash generated by operations. With respect to our short-term debt maturities, we expect to refinance or extend them prior to maturity. We are currently in the process of amending and extending a 400.0 million loan on a portfolio of assets held by one of our consolidated JVs that matures on December 19, 2024. While it is the parties' expectation that this transaction will close prior to the due date there are no assurances and the joint venture could be required to pay off the loan or it may be assigned to a special servicer. 
 
 Long-term liquidity 
 
 Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, development and debt refinancings. We do not expect to have sufficient funds on hand to cover these long-term cash requirements due to REIT federal tax rules which require that we distribute at least 90 of our income on an annual basis. We plan to meet our long-term liquidity needs through long-term secured non-recourse debt, the issuance of equity securities, including common stock and OP Units, as well as property dispositions and JV transactions. 
 
 We only use non-recourse debt secured by our properties. As of the date of this report, approximately 45 of our total office portfolio was unencumbered. To mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on our cash flows from operations, we generally enter into interest rate swap agreements with respect to our loans with floating interest rates. These swap agreements generally expire two years before the maturity date of the related loan, during which time we can refinance the loan without any interest penalty. We also enter into interest rate cap agreements from time to time to cap the interest rates on our floating rate loans. See Notes 8 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our debt and derivative contracts, respectively. See Item 3 "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" of this Report regarding the impact of interest rate increases on our future operating results and cash flows. 

Certain Contractual Obligations 
 
 See the following notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for information regarding our contractual commitments: 
 
 Note 4 - minimum future ground lease payments; 
 Note 8 - minimum future principal payments for our secured notes payable, and the interest rates that determine our future periodic interest payments; and 
 Note 16 - contractual commitments and guarantees. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Unconsolidated Fund Debt 
 
 Our Fund, Partnership X, has its own secured non-recourse debt and interest rate swaps. We have made certain environmental and other limited indemnities and guarantees covering customary non-recourse carve-outs related to that loan, and we have also guaranteed the interest rate swaps. Partnership X has agreed to indemnify us for any amounts that we would be required to pay under these agreements. As of September 30, 2024, all of the obligations under the respective loan and swap agreements have been performed in accordance with the terms of those agreements. See "Guarantees" in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information about our Fund's debt and swaps, and the respective guarantees.

Cash Flows 
 
 Comparison of nine months ended September 30, 2024 to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Our operating cash flows were adversely impacted by the effects of inflation and higher interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) In Cash 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities (1) 
 334,590 332,209 2,381 0.7 Net cash used in investing activities (2) 
 (156,570) (180,373) 23,803 13.2 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (3) 
 (156,947) 105,557 (262,504) (248.7) 
 ________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our portfolio, the collectibility of tenant receivables, the level of our operating and general and administrative expenses, and interest expense. The increase in cash from operating activities of 2.4 million was primarily due to: (i) higher cash provided by working capital, (ii) higher interest income, (iii) lower office property taxes, (iv) new units from our multifamily development projects, (v) higher multifamily rental rates, and (vi) lower general and administrative expenses. The increase was partly offset by (i) lower office occupancy and tenant recoveries, (ii) higher interest expense, and (iii) the removal of our Barrington Plaza property from service during the second quarter of 2023. 
 (2) Our cash flows from investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions, developments and redevelopment projects, and Recurring and non-Recurring Capital Expenditures. The increase in cash from investing activities of 23.8 million w as primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures for improvements to real estate and developments, partly offset by an acquisition of an additional interest in our unconsolidated fund, Partnership X. 
 (3) Our cash flows from financing activities are generally impacted by our borrowings and capital activities, as well as dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests, respectively. The decrease in cash from financing activities of 262.5 million wa s primarily due to net borrowings during the prior period, partly offset by the repurchase of common stock during the prior period. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 We have not made any changes to our critical accounting policies disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP, and which requires us to make estimates of certain items, which affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. While we believe that our estimates are based upon reasonable assumptions and judgments at the time that they are made, some of our estimates could prove to be incorrect, and those differences could be material. Some of our estimates are subject to adjustment as we believe appropriate, based on revised estimates, and reconciliation to actual results when available.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Fixed-Rate Borrowings and Hedged Borrowings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the interest rates for 62 of our consolidated borrowings were fixed or swap-fixed with interest rate swaps, and 15 were capped with interest rate caps. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum amount the interest expense on our capped-rate borrowings could increase by is 15.8 million per year. Higher interest rates would cause an increase in our future interest expense on our capped-rate debt, which would reduce our future net income, cash flows from operations and FFO. Our interest rate swap agreements generally expire two years before the maturity date of the related loan, during which time we can refinance the loan without any interest penalty. After the interest rate swap agreements expire the related debt will be floating rate. Higher interests rates, to the extent they are higher than our swap-fixed rates when our interest rate swaps expire, would cause our future interest expense on our debt to increase, which would reduce our future net income, cash flows from operations and FFO. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our debt maturities and our interest rate swap expirations. 
 
 Our use of interest rate swaps and caps also exposes us to credit risk from the potential inability of our counterparties to perform under the terms of those agreements. We attempt to minimize this credit risk by contracting with a variety of financial counterparties with investment grade ratings. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our interest rate swaps and caps. 
 
 Unhedged Floating-Rate Borrowings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the interest rates for 23 of our consolidated borrowings were floating. As of September 30, 2024, the interest expense for our unhedged floating-rate borrowings would increase by 13.0 million per year for every one hundred basis point increase in the related benchmark interest rate. Higher interest rates would cause an increase in our future interest expense on our floating-rate debt, which would reduce our future net income, cash flows from operations and FFO. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our floating rate debt.

 As of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our CEO and CFO, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on the foregoing, our CEO and CFO concluded, as of that time, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
