Fair value Derivatives not designated as September 30, December 31, hedging instruments 2024 2023 Balance Sheet location Assets: Foreign currency exchange contracts Accounts receivable, net Liabilities: Foreign currency exchange contracts ) ) Accrued liabilities Cash Flow Hedging Strategy The Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in commodity prices. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our condensed consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in the fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is currently less than two years. The Company has entered into commodity hedge contracts to mitigate the price risk associated with a portion of its forecasted aluminum purchases. These derivative instruments were designated as part of the Company s commodity cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of aluminum. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for this program were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table presents the impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income, AOCI and earnings: Cost of sales

Economic (Non-Designated) Hedging Strategy The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks related primarily to its foreign business operations. During the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts of the Company that were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 have terms of approximately or less. The Company does not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. The Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in interest and other income (expense), net, in the condensed consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in the condensed consolidated statements of income were as follows:

Gross Billings represent amounts invoiced to customers net of cash discounts, returns and excise taxes. Gross billings are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and is useful to investors in evaluating overall Company performance. The use of gross billings allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross billings provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross billings is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross billings has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross billings may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross billings with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales: 

Three-Months Ended Percentage Nine-Months Ended Percentage (In thousands) September 30, Change September 30, Change 2024 2023 24 vs. 23 2024 2023 24 vs. 23 Gross Billings 2,209,023 2,148,834 2.8 6,616,108 6,245,968 5.9 Deferred Revenue 10,044 10,043 0.0 29,897 29,974 (0.3) Less: Promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses 338,094 302,849 11.6 965,337 866,023 11.5 Net Sales 1,880,973 1,856,028 1.3 5,680,668 5,409,919 5.0 Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products primarily include consideration given to our non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to

 bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers /distributors sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs for our energy drink products with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. Promotional and other allowances for our Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price promotions where permitted. Sales The table below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Data from any one or more quarters or periods is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of our energy drinks are expressed in unit case volume. A unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates as if converted into finished products sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. Beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. However, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. In addition, our continued growth internationally may further reduce the impact of seasonality on our business. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in advertising and promotional expenses.

 See Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations for additional information related to net sales. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2024, we had 1.63 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Of our 1.63 billion of cash and cash equivalents held at September 30, 2024, 1.12 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Long-term debt. In May 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other lenders, which provides for senior unsecured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of 1.50 billion (collectively, the Credit Facilities ). The Credit Facilities consist of a 750.0 million term loan (the Term Loan and up to 750.0 million in multicurrency revolving loan commitments (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Term Loan matures May 2027 and the Revolving Credit Facility matures May 2029. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities may be repaid at any time during the term of the Credit Facilities and, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, may be reborrowed prior to the maturity date. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility had remaining availability of 750.0 million. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and access to credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development requirements, purchases of capital assets, purchases of equipment, purchases of real property and purchases of shares of our common stock, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be less than 500.0 million through September 30, 2025. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property, plant and manufacturing equipment, and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.

For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a 197.1 million decrease in inventories, a 46.7 million increase in accrued liabilities, a 31.5 million increase in accrued promotional allowances and a 4.2 million increase in income taxes payable.

Cash used in financing activities was 2.97 billion for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used in financing activities of 433.8 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used in financing activities for both the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily the result of the repurchases of our common stock.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.

 The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC is not exhaustive. See Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.
