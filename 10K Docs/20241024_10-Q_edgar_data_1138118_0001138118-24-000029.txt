 ownership interest in J J Worldwide Services (J J), a leading provider of engineering services, base support operations and facilities maintenance for the U.S. federal government. J J primarily serves the U.S. Department of Defense through long-term, fixed-price contracts and is reported as part of our Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) segment. The acquisition is consistent with key elements of our M A strategy that focus on enhancing our technical services capabilities, increasing revenue resilience and secular growth, and expanding our government client base within our GWS segment. 
 The J J acquisition was treated as a business combination under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. We financed the acquisition with a new issuance in February 2024 of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due April 1, 2029; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility under our 2023 Credit Agreement; and (iii) cash on hand. See Note 8 for more information on the above-mentioned debt instruments. 
 Deferred and contingent consideration 
 Total consideration 
 
 The purchase price included million of contingent consideration, representing the acquisition date fair value recognized for up to million gross of potential future earnout payments based on the achievement of certain performance thresholds during calendar years 2025 and 2026. 
 Less: Estimated fair value of net assets acquired (see table below) Excess purchase price over estimated fair value of net assets acquired 
 The preliminary purchase accounting adjustments related to the J J acquisition have been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and non-controlling interest has been recorded to goodwill. The goodwill arising from the J J acquisition consists largely of the synergies and opportunities to deliver premier engineering services, base support operations and facilities maintenance services. Of the goodwill generated, approximately million is deductible for tax purposes. 
 The acquired assets and assumed liabilities of J J were recorded at their estimated fair values. The purchase price allocation for the business combination is preliminary, primarily for intangibles, and subject to change within the respective measurement period which will not extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Any such adjustments may be material.

 The accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes revenue, operating loss and net loss of million, million and million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes revenue, operating loss and net loss of million, million and million, respectively, attributable to the J J acquisition. This does not include the total direct transaction and integration costs of million, million, and million incurred during the first, second and third quarters of 2024, respectively, in connection with the J J acquisition, which are included in the unaudited pro forma results. 
 The fair value of customer relationships and backlog was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method (MPEEM), a form of the Income Approach. The MPEEM is a specific application of the Discounted Cash Flow Method. The principle behind the MPEEM is that the value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the incremental cash flows attributable only to the subject intangible asset. This estimation used certain unobservable key inputs such as timing of projected cash flows, growth rates, expected contract renewal probabilities, discount rates, and the assessment of useful life.

 Fair value measurements for our available for sale debt securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument s terms and conditions. 
 The equity securities are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and ask prices on such date. The above tables do not include million related to capital investments as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in certain non-public entities as they are non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost minus impairment. These investments are included in Other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 The fair values of the warehouse receivables are primarily calculated based on locked-in purchase prices. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans (see Note 4). These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as a substantial majority of inputs are readily observable. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries at fair value using NAV were million and million, respectively, and investments at fair value using NAV which are not accounted for under the equity method were million and million, respectively. These investments fall under practical expedient rules that do not require them to be included in the fair value hierarchy and as a result have been excluded from the tables above.

The applicable rate for borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement is determined by reference to our Credit Rating (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2024, we had (i) million of euro term loan borrowings outstanding under the 2023 Credit Agreement (at an interest rate of plus EURIBOR) and (ii) million of U.S. Dollar term loan borrowings outstanding under the 2023 Credit Agreement (at an interest rate of plus Adjusted Term SOFR), net of unamortized debt issuance costs, included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 The term loan borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement are guaranteed on a senior basis by CBRE Group, Inc. and CBRE Services.

Completion and budget guarantees generally require us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget. While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees. 
 Performance and payment bonds 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are required by certain customers to provide performance and payment bonds for contractual commitments related to our projects. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that the company will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay our subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay our subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond.

The balance increased as of September 30, 2024 based on additional information obtained and evaluations performed allowing for a more refined estimate on a building-by-building basis. 
 Management obtained additional fire safety assessments, reviewed various inputs and assumptions, including bids from subcontractors, and believes the above balance remains our best estimate of future losses associated with overall remediation efforts. 
 The estimated remediation costs for in-scope buildings are subjective, highly complex and dependent on a number of variables outside of Telford Homes control. These include, but are not limited to, individual remediation requirements for each building, the time required for the remediation to be completed, cost of construction or remediation materials, availability of construction materials, potential discoveries made during remediation that could necessitate incremental work, investigation costs, availability of qualified fire safety engineers, potential business disruption costs, potential changes to or new regulations and regulatory approval. We will continue to assess new information as it becomes available during the remediation process and adjust our estimated liability accordingly.

Most notably, office leasing activity accelerated in the third quarter as greater certainty about the economic outlook supports occupier decision making across primary and secondary markets, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Increased liquidity, lower borrowing costs and improved investor sentiment resulted an increase in investment sales for the first time since 2022. As capital returns to real estate, opportunities to harvest gains from real estate development and investment management portfolios are expected to increase. 
 Capital Allocation 
 We used 62 million in the quarter for share repurchases, while maintaining substantial liquidity to finance future growth.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 We reported consolidated net income of 225 million for the quarter, an increase of 17.8 from 191 million in the same period in 2023. Over the same time period, revenue increased 14.8 to 9.0 billion. 
 The revenue increase reflected an increase across all lines of businesses in the Advisory Services segment, with strong growth in leasing, particularly for office space, commercial mortgage origination, and property management, as well as continued strong growth in the Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) segment. Overall, revenue from our Resilient Businesses (comprised of facilities management, project management, property management, loan servicing, asset management fees in our investment management business and valuations), which generally grow across market cycles, increased approximately 12.6 in the quarter. Our Transactional Businesses (sales, leasing, mortgage origination, carried interest and incentive fees in our 
 32 

Table of contents 

 investment management business, and development fees), which are subject to market cycles, saw revenue increase 25.7 in the quarter. Lower interest rates drove an increase in property sales and commercial mortgage origination, along with leasing, which was up 19.0 , in the Advisory Services segment and investment and development activities in the Real Estate Investments (REI) segment, both of which are sensitive to market cycles and interest rate fluctuations. 
 Foreign currency translation had a 0.6 negative impact on revenue, reflecting the weakness in the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling. 
 Cost of revenue increased 13.4 during the quarter due to the strong revenue growth noted previously, consisting of higher pass-through costs, higher compensation, higher transaction commissions, and higher indirect reimbursed costs. Foreign currency translation had a 0.5 positive impact on total cost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased to 80.2 of total revenue from 81.3 in the third quarter 2023, driven by growth in our Advisory Services segment revenue that generally has higher gross margin. 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by 16.9 , primarily due to 61 million of restructuring charges (employee separation benefits, contract termination fees, consulting charges, etc.) and an indirect tax accrual in the third quarter of 2024 versus 4 million recorded in the same period in the prior year. In addition, we recorded higher incentive compensation expense compared to the same quarter in the prior year to align with improved business performance. Foreign currency translation had a 0.3 positive impact on total operating, administrative and other expenses during the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue slightly increased to 13.7 in the third quarter 2024 from 13.4 in the third quarter 2023, reflecting higher operating expenses related to restructuring charges and the indirect tax accrual. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 19.5 during the quarter, reflecting higher amortization expense related to intangibles from recent acquisitions such as J J Worldwide Services. 
 We incurred an equity loss of 4 million versus an equity loss of 13 million in last year s third quarter. This was mainly due to lower net unrealized losses related to equity investments. 
 Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by 68.4 , compared with the third quarter 2023. This increase was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates, increased borrowings on the revolving credit facilities, and the issuance of new debt in 2024. 
 Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 67 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a provision for income taxes of 31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 36 million is primarily related to an increase in earnings. Our effective tax rate increased to 21.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is different than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 , primarily due to U.S. state taxes and favorable permanent book tax differences. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation Development (OECD) Pillar Two Model Rules established a minimum global effective tax rate of 15 on country-by-country profits for large multinational companies. European Union member states along with many other countries have adopted, or expect to adopt, the OECD Pillar Two Model effective January 1, 2024 or thereafter. The OECD and other countries continue to publish guidelines and legislation which include transition and safe harbor rules. The Pillar Two top-up taxes are not expected to have a material impact to our financial statements for 2024. However, we continue to monitor new legislative changes and assess the global impact of the Pillar Two Model Rules, including the potential applicability and impact of the under-taxed profits rule that is effective in 2025. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 We reported consolidated net income of 481 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on revenue of 25.4 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 509 million on revenue of 23.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The revenue increase reflected growth in property management, leasing activity, particularly for office space, commercial mortgage origination, loan servicing, and continued strong growth in the GWS segment. Although we began to see an increase in property sales in our Advisory Services segment due to lower interest rates in the third quarter of 2024, higher interest rates for the first half of 2024 continued to weigh on property sales in the Advisory Services segment and investment

 and development activities in the REI segment, both of which are sensitive to market cycles and interest rates. Overall, revenue from our Resilient Businesses increased 10.1 for the period. Our Transactional Businesses saw revenue edge up 11.0 . 
 Foreign currency translation had a 0.4 negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by weakness in the Japanese yen, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling. 
 Cost of revenue increased 10.4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to revenue growth, consisting of higher pass-through costs, higher compensation, and higher indirect reimbursed costs. Foreign currency translation had a 0.4 positive impact on total cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased slightly to 80.9 of total revenue from 80.8 , driven by higher cost to support growth in GWS revenues. 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased 5.4 as compared to the same period last year. The company incurred approximately 171 million in restructuring and an indirect tax accrual this year versus 145 million recorded in the same period in the prior year, and higher compensation expense. This was partially offset by bonus expense reversal as part of the restructuring activities and lower bonus expense related to the REI segment to align with overall expected segment performance. Foreign currency translation had a 0.2 positive impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13.9 from 14.6 , as operating expenses grew slower than revenue. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 6.9 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting higher depreciation and amortization expense related to assets acquired from recent acquisitions such as J J Worldwide Services. 
 We incurred an equity loss of 77 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to equity income of 121 million in the same period in 2023. This was mainly due to an unusually large development asset disposition in first-quarter 2023 that did not recur in 2024. In addition, we recorded higher unrealized losses related to our non-core strategic equity investment in Altus Power, Inc. (Altus) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other income increased to 26 million from 22 million, reflecting positive fair value adjustments on certain financial instruments related to our investment in Industrious this year as compared to the same period last year. 
 Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by 48.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates, during most of the period, increased borrowings on the revolving credit facilities, and the issuance of new debt during the first quarter of 2024 and in late second-quarter 2023. 
 Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 70 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a provision for income taxes of 114 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 44 million is primarily related to the reversal of unrecognized tax positions. Our effective tax rate decreased to 11.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is different than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to the reversal of unrecognized tax positions, U.S. state taxes, and favorable permanent book tax differences. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation Development (OECD) Pillar Two Model Rules established a minimum global effective tax rate of 15 on country-by-country profits for large multinational companies. European Union member states along with many other countries have adopted, or expect to adopt, the OECD Pillar Two Model effective January 1, 2024 or thereafter. The OECD and other countries continue to publish guidelines and legislation which include transition and safe harbor rules. The Pillar Two top-up taxes are not expected to have a material impact to our financial statements for 2024. However, we continue to monitor new legislative changes and assess the global impact of the Pillar Two Model Rules, including the potential applicability and impact of the under-taxed profits rule that is effective in 2025.

 Segment Operations 
 On June 24, 2024, we announced plans to combine our project management business with our Turner Townsend subsidiary and expect this transaction to close in early 2025. We intend to organize our operations around, and publicly report our financial results on, four reportable segments in 2025. For the remainder of 2024, we will continue to report our financial results under our existing reportable segments given this is how the chief operating decision maker currently manages the business. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we organize our operations around, and publicly report our financial results on, three global business segments: (1) Advisory Services; (2) Global Workplace Solutions; and (3) Real Estate Investments. 
 Advisory Services provides a comprehensive range of services globally, including property leasing, capital markets (property sales and mortgage origination), mortgage sales and servicing, property management, and valuation. Global Workplace Solutions provides a broad suite of integrated, contractually based outsourcing services to occupiers of real estate, including facilities management and project management. Real Estate Investments includes investment management services provided globally and development services in the U.S., U.K. and Continental Europe. 
 We also have a Corporate and Other segment. Corporate primarily consists of corporate overhead costs. Other consists of activities from strategic non-core non-controlling equity investments and is considered an operating segment but does not meet the aggregation criteria for presentation as a separate reportable segment and is, therefore, combined with Corporate and reported as Corporate and other. It also includes eliminations related to inter-segment revenue. For additional information on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue increased 19.0 during the quarter. Global leasing revenue rose 19.0 , driven by Americas which grew 19.9 , including 24.1 in the United States and the United Kingdom, which grew 31.3 . Property sales revenue was up 14.1 , reflecting the impact of lower interest rates and improving credit conditions. The company s loan origination business benefited from higher loan origination fees driven by increased financing activity, resulting from lower interest rates. Property management grew 22.3 fueled by growth across regions and in the U.S. and continued growth from the Brookfield portfolio. Foreign currency translation had a 0.5 negative impact on total revenue during the quarter, primarily driven by weakness in the Brazilian real, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling. 
 Cost of revenue increased 18.0 , primarily reflecting business growth, higher reimbursable expenses in property management and higher professional compensation as bonuses reset. Foreign currency translation had a 0.4 positive impact on total cost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased to 61.7 of total revenue from 62.3 in the 2023 third quarter, primarily due to growth in leasing and sales, which have higher margins.

Table of contents 

 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by 4.0 , primarily due to incentive compensation expense increases in the current quarter to align with business performance. Foreign currency translation had a 0.8 positive impact on total operating expenses. 
 In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for which the company retains servicing rights, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the retained mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on the date the loans are sold. Upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue). Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized (within amortization expense) and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, MSRs contributed 38 million to operating income, offset by 36 million of amortization of related intangible assets. The MSR contribution to third quarter 2023 operating income was 22 million and amortization totaled 35 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 6.1 primarily due to higher amortization of mortgage servicing rights as described above. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue increased 10.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Global leasing revenue rose 10.9 , driven by Americas which grew 12.4 , including 14.6 in the United States and the United Kingdom, which grew 10.6 . Property sales revenue was down 0.2 , reflecting high interest rates and difficult credit conditions in the first half of 2024, offset by an increase in property sales in the third quarter 2024, driven by lower interest rates. The company s loan origination business benefited from higher loan fees and a significant increase in interest earnings on escrow balances. Property management also grew solidly, up 15.1 . Foreign currency translation had a 0.5 negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by weakness in Japanese yen, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling. 
 Cost of revenue increased 10.3 , primarily reflecting business growth, higher reimbursable expenses in property management, higher professional compensation and higher commission expense. Foreign currency translation had a 0.4 positive impact on total cost of revenue. Cost of revenue slightly decreased to 61.1 of total revenue from 61.2 for the same period in 2023 due to growth in leasing and improving sales. 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses slightly increased by 0.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, driven by higher variable employee compensation costs. The increase was partially offset by lower restructuring expenses as the Advisory Services segment recorded significant restructuring expenses in the first half of 2023, as the segment went through rapid cost take out that did not recur this year. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.4 positive impact on total operating expenses. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, MSRs contributed 74 million to operating income, offset by 104 million of amortization of related intangible assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, MSRs contributed 60 million to operating income, offset by 109 million of amortization of related intangible assets. The increase was associated with higher origination activity given an increase in financing activities in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 6.0 primarily due to lower amortization of mortgage servicing rights as described above and due to accelerated depreciation expense recorded in the first half of 2023, as part of cost savings initiatives that did not recur this year.

 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) During the first quarter of 2024, we incurred integration and other costs related to acquisitions of 18 million in deal and integration costs, offset by reversal of 22 million in previously recognized transaction-related bonus expense due to change in estimate. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue increased 12.3 , reflecting a double-digit increase in facilities management, led by the Enterprise and Local businesses, and growth in project management due to continued strong performance from Turner Townsend. Foreign currency translation had a 0.7 negative impact on total revenue during the quarter, primarily driven by weakness in the Mexican peso, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling. 
 Cost of revenue increased 12.0 , driven by higher pass-through costs and increased professional compensation. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6 positive impact on total cost of revenue. Cost of revenue was 90.1 of total revenue, slightly down from 90.3 in the third quarter 2023. 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased 8.6 , primarily due to higher employee compensation expenses, and restructuring expenses such as severance. Foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total operating expenses during the quarter. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 36.4 , reflecting higher amortization expense related to intangibles from recent acquisitions such as J J Worldwide Services.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue increased 10.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting a double-digit increase in facilities management, led by the Enterprise and Local business, and growth in project management due to continued strong growth from Turner Townsend. Foreign currency translation had a 0.4 negative impact on total revenue, primarily driven by weakness in the Japanese yen, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling. 
 Cost of revenue increased 10.3 , driven by higher pass-through costs, higher indirect reimbursed costs, and increased professional compensation to support the growth in the business. Foreign currency translation had a 0.4 positive impact on total cost of revenue. Cost of revenue was 90.5 of total revenue, a slight increase from 90.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a shift in composition of revenue with more revenue coming from facilities management, supported by the J J acquisition, which generally has lower margins as compared to project management. 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased 5.2 , primarily due to restructuring charges incurred related to cost savings initiatives and the inclusion of J J s operating results since acquisition at the end of February 2024. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.3 positive impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 23.5 primarily due to increased amortization expense on intangibles related to the J J and certain other in-fill acquisitions.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue increased 43.8 for the current quarter. This reflected an increase in incentive fees in our investment management and development services lines of business. Foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total revenue. 
 Cost of revenue increased 39.5 , and was 19.9 of total revenue down from 20.4 in the same period in 2023. We incurred higher construction costs related to real estate development as compared to the same period in 2023. Foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total cost of revenue during the quarter. 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased 49.7 primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation in our development services and investment management line of business consistent with higher revenue growth. Foreign currency translation had a 0.7 negative impact on total operating expenses. 
 We recorded equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of approximately 14 million versus equity loss of 4 million in the third quarter 2023, primarily due to higher co-investment returns in investment management and sales of equity method investments in development services. Gain on disposition of real estate decreased by 6 million compared with third quarter 2023 given limited disposition activity.

 A roll forward of our AUM by product type for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows (dollars in billions): 
 Funds Separate Accounts Securities Total Balance at June 30, 2024 64.5 69.1 8.9 142.5 Inflows 1.0 1.0 0.2 2.2 Outflows (0.2) (0.7) (0.3) (1.2) Market appreciation 1.7 1.9 1.2 4.8 Balance at September 30, 2024 67.0 71.3 10.0 148.3 
 AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures. Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. Our assets under management consist of: 
 the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM. The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. In the case of real estate operating companies, the total value of real properties controlled by the companies, generally through joint ventures, is included in AUM; and 
 the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds investments. 
 Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue increased 10.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. This reflected an increase in incentive fees in our investment management and development services lines of business. The increase was partially offset by lower real estate development sales revenue. Foreign currency translation had a 0.4 positive impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by strength in the British pound sterling, partially offset by weakness in the Japanese yen. 
 Cost of revenue increased 21.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher construction costs incurred on our real estate development projects. Foreign currency translation had a 2.3 negative impact on total cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased 0.7 , primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation in our development services and investment management line of business consistent with higher revenue growth, partially offset by lower bonus expense to align with overall segment performance, and 21 million in charges associated with the company s efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with no such cost in 2024. Foreign currency translation had a 0.5 negative impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We recorded equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of approximately 29 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to equity income of 160 million in the same period in 2023, which included an unusually large gain on a development portfolio asset sale. Gain on disposition of real estate decreased by 6 million compared to the same period in 2023.

 Corporate and Other 
 Our Corporate segment primarily consists of corporate overhead costs. Other consists of activities from strategic non-core non-controlling equity investments and is considered an operating segment but does not meet the aggregation criteria for presentation as a separate reportable segment and is, therefore, combined with our core Corporate function and reported as Corporate and other. The following table summarizes our results of operations for our core Corporate and other segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Core corporate 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses for our core corporate functions rose 54.3 to 162 million for the third quarter of 2024, mainly due to an increase in our provision related to indirect taxes, increased charges associated with employee separation and certain one-time charges related to acquisitions. In addition, we recorded higher incentive compensation expense due to improving earnings. 
 Other (non-core) 
 We recorded an equity loss of 10 million, reflecting the lower value of our investment in publicly traded Altus Power, Inc. (Altus), offset by equity income from investments in other unconsolidated subsidiaries. This compares with a 11 million loss in third-quarter 2023, reflecting the market value of our Altus ownership interest. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Core corporate 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses for our core corporate functions rose 36.7 to 443 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to an increase in our provision related to indirect taxes, increased charges associated with employee separation and certain one-time charges related to acquisitions. In addition, we recorded higher incentive compensation expense due to improving earnings.

Table of contents 

 Other (non-core) 
 We recorded equity loss of 102 million, reflecting the lower value of our investment in Altus, offset by equity income from investments in other unconsolidated subsidiaries. This compares with a 43 million loss during the same period in 2023, reflecting the market value of our Altus ownership interest. We recorded positive fair value adjustment on our investment portfolio in Industrious which partially offset the losses from Altus and generated positive other income of 11 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. Our expected capital requirements for 2024 include up to 312 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 193 million of capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions received. As of September 30, 2024, we had aggregate future commitments of 154 million related to co-investments funds in our REI segment, 36 million of which is expected to be funded in 2024. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we are committed to fund additional capital of 153 million and 51 million to consolidated and unconsolidated projects, respectively, within our REI segment. As of September 30, 2024, we had 3.0 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities (under both the Revolving Credit Agreement, as described below, and the Turner Townsend revolving credit facility) and 1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents. 
 We have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facilities to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements. In the absence of extraordinary events, large strategic acquisitions or large returns of capital to shareholders, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facilities would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. Given compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals are generally paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production, the negative effect of difficult market conditions is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive. We may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem, or retire our existing senior notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, or otherwise. 
 In February 2024, we conducted a new issuance for 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500 senior notes due in 2029 (the 5.500 senior notes) generating net proceeds of 495 million which included debt issuance cost of 1 million related to this issuance. 
 As noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future. 
 Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of the following elements. The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. If our cash flow is insufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all. 
 The second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase consideration in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had accrued deferred purchase and contingent consideration totaling 568 million 283 million of which was a current liability) and 530 million 264 million of which was a current liability), respectively, which was included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses and in Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

 The third, as described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, in November 2021, our board of directors authorized a program for the company to repurchase up to 2.0 billion of our Class A common stock over five years, effective November 19, 2021 (the 2021 program). In August 2022, our board of directors authorized an additional 2.0 billion, bringing the total authorized repurchase amount under the 2021 program to a total of 4.0 billion. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 567,209 shares of our Class A common stock with an average price of 109.20 per share using cash on hand for an aggregate of 62 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,121,950 shares of our Class A common stock with an average price of 98.35 per share using cash on hand for an aggregate of 110 million. During the period October 1, 2024 through October 21, 2024, we repurchased 21,324 shares of our Class A common stock with an average price of 119.48 per share using cash on hand for an aggregate of 3 million. As of both September 30, 2024 and October 21, 2024, we had 1.4 billion of capacity remaining under the 2021 program. 
 Our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash. We may utilize our stock repurchase programs to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses. The timing of any future repurchases and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors. 
 
 Historical Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 368 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 373 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers that contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities were as follows: (1) working capital movements, driven by lesser outflows related to accounts payable and accrued expenses and lower accounts receivable due to better collections which lagged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and (2) higher net cash flows from operations, driven by revenue growth. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities totaled 1,494 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 957 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of J J Worldwide Services in February 2024 and Direct Line Global in June 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 927 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 906 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increased inflow was primarily driven by lower outflow related to share repurchases, net proceeds from the revolver, and deferred purchase considerations, partially offset by lower fixed term debt financing, and higher payment of taxes on equity awards.

 Indebtedness 
 We use a variety of financing arrangements, both long-term and short-term, to fund our operations in addition to cash generated from operating activities. We also use several funding sources to avoid becoming overly dependent on one financing source, and to lower funding costs. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 On July 10, 2023, CBRE Group, Inc., CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) and Relam Amsterdam Holdings B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Services, entered into a new 5-year senior unsecured Credit Agreement (2023 Credit Agreement) maturing on July 10, 2028, which refinanced and replaced the previous credit agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan credit facility comprised of (i) tranche A Euro-denominated term loans in an aggregate principal amount of 367 million and (ii) tranche A U.S. Dollar-denominated term loans in an aggregate principal amount of 350 million with weighted average interest rate of 5.3 as of September 30, 2024, both requiring quarterly principal payments beginning on December 31, 2024 and continuing through maturity on July 10, 2028. The proceeds of the term loans under the 2023 Credit Agreement were applied to the repayment of all remaining outstanding senior term loans, approximately 437 million, under the previous credit agreement, the payment of related fees and expenses and other general corporate purposes. 
 On February 23, 2024, CBRE Services issued 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500 senior notes due April 1, 2029 (the 5.500 senior notes) at a price equal to 99.837 of their face value.

Interest accrues at a rate of 5.950 per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. 
 On March 18, 2021, CBRE Services issued 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.500 senior notes due April 1, 2031 (the 2.500 senior notes) at a price equal to 98.451 of their face value. The 2.500 senior notes are unsecured obligations of CBRE Services and are guaranteed on a senior basis by CBRE Group, Inc.

Interest accrues at a rate of 4.875 per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. 
 The indentures governing our 5.950 senior notes, 5.500 senior notes, 4.875 senior notes and 2.500 senior notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create or permit liens on assets securing indebtedness, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and enter into consolidations or mergers. 
 The term loan borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CBRE Group, Inc. and CBRE Services. Our Revolving Credit Agreement, 5.950 senior notes, 5.500 senior notes, 4.875 senior notes and 2.500 senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CBRE Group, Inc.

 Short-Term Borrowings 
 On August 5, 2022, we entered into a new 5-year senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility available to CBRE Services with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to 3.5 billion and a maturity date of August 5, 2027. 
 The Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to pay a fee based on the total amount of the revolving credit facility commitment (whether used or unused). In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement also includes capacity for letters of credit not to exceed 300 million in the aggregate. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 683 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, as well as 10 million of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, no amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of October 21, 2024, 640 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and would reduce the amount we may borrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 In addition, Turner Townsend maintains a 120 million revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement dated March 31, 2022, with an additional accordion option of 20 million, that matures on March 31, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, no amount was outstanding under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2023, 10 million 8 million) was outstanding under this revolving credit facility.

 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe could have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and are incorporated by reference herein. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical accounting policies, which include revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies, and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries fair value option can be found in our 2023 Annual Report . There have been no material changes to these policies and estimates as of September 30, 2024.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Net revenue, segment operating profit on revenue margin, segment operating profit on net revenue margin, and core EBITDA are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected costs and charges that may obscure the underlying performance of our business and related trends. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of net revenue and core EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Net revenue is gross revenue less costs largely associated with subcontracted vendor work performed for clients and generally has no margin. Segment operating profit on revenue margin is computed by dividing segment operating profit by revenue and provides a comparable profitability measure against our peers. Segment operating profit on net revenue margin is computed by dividing segment operating profit by net revenue and is a better indicator of the segment s margin since it does not include the diluting effect of pass-through revenue which generally has no margin. 
 We use core EBITDA as an indicator of the company s operating financial performance. Core EBITDA represents earnings before the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, asset impairments, adjustments related to carried interest incentive compensation expense to align with the timing of associated revenue, costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring, efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives, charges related to indirect tax audit / settlement, integration and other costs related to acquisitions, provision associated with Telford s fire safety remediation efforts, and the impact of fair value adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments. We believe that investors may find this measure useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. 
 Core EBITDA is not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. This measure may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt. We also use core EBITDA as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The information in this section should be read in connection with the information on market risk related to changes in interest rates and non-U.S. currency exchange rates in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Annual Report . 
 Our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations. We manage such risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments. We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, when accounting for derivative financial instruments. In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 International Operations 
 We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside the U.S. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. Our Real Estate Investments (REI) business segment has significant euro and British pound denominated assets under management (AUM), as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe. In addition, our Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business segment also derives significant revenue and earnings in foreign currencies, such as the euro and British pound sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may continue to produce corresponding changes in our AUM, revenue and earnings. 
 Our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional (reporting) currency, which is the U.S. dollar. 
 Our businesses could suffer from adverse effects of high interest rates, a rapid increase in interest rates, limited access to debt capital or liquidity constraints, downturns in general macroeconomic conditions, regulatory or financial market uncertainty, or unforeseen disruptions such as public health crises and geopolitical events like the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East (or the perception that such disruptions may occur). 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 42.3 and 43.6 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, respectively. The following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies (dollars in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 United States dollar 5,211 57.7 4,277 54.4 14,305 56.4 12,642 55.0 British pound sterling 1,257 13.9 1,100 14.0 3,537 13.9 3,152 13.7 Euro 775 8.6 746 9.5 2,271 9.0 2,125 9.2 Canadian dollar 248 2.7 285 3.6 788 3.1 865 3.8 Australian dollar 249 2.8 222 2.8 677 2.7 633 2.8 Indian rupee 189 2.1 165 2.1 543 2.1 478 2.1 Chinese yuan 113 1.3 125 1.6 343 1.4 372 1.6 Japanese yen 109 1.2 114 1.4 339 1.3 343 1.5 Swiss franc 126 1.4 110 1.4 353 1.4 307 1.3 Singapore dollar 110 1.2 99 1.3 310 1.2 294 1.3 Other currencies (1) 
 649 7.1 625 7.9 1,897 7.5 1,788 7.7 Total revenue 9,036 100.0 7,868 100.0 25,363 100.0 22,999 100.0 
 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Approximately 45 currencies comprise 7.1 and 7.9 of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Approximately 45 and 46 currencies comprise 7.5 and 7.7 of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Table of contents 

 Although we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar will positively or negatively impact our reported results. A hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, would have decreased pre-tax income by 1 million. A hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro would have increased pre-tax income by 9 million. These hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into U.S. dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10 change in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations. 
 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in revenue and earnings as well as the assets under management for our investment management business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affect the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. We routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant. 
 
 Interest Rates 
 We manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates. 
 The estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately 748 million at September 30, 2024. Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair values of our 5.950 senior notes, 5.500 senior notes, 4.875 senior notes and 2.500 senior notes were 1.1 billion, 522 million, 603 million and 437 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. 
 We utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on our variable rate debt. If interest rates were to increase 100 basis points on our outstanding variable rate debt at September 30, 2024, the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 11 million on pre-tax income and cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, and we have a disclosure policy in furtherance of the same. This evaluation is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects. The evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervise and participate in this evaluation, and they are assisted by members of our Disclosure Committee. Our Disclosure Committee consists of our General Counsel, our Chief Accounting Officer, our Senior Officers of significant business lines and other select employees. 
 We conducted the required evaluation, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) were effective as of September 30, 2024 to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 _______________________________ 
 (1) In November 2021, our board of directors authorized a program for the company to repurchase up to 2.0 billion of our Class A common stock over five years, effective November 19, 2021 (the 2021 program). In August 2022, our board of directors authorized an additional 2.0 billion under this program, bringing the total authorized amount under the 2021 program to a total of 4.0 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 62 million of our common stock under the 2021 program. The remaining 1.4 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the 2021 program as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash. We may utilize our stock repurchase programs to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses. The timing of any future repurchases and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors.
