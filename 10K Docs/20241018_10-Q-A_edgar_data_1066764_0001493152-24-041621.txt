TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

and outstanding shares of Bitech Mining (collectively, the Bitech Mining Shares ). In consideration of the Bitech Mining
Shares, the Company issued to the Sellers an aggregate of shares of the Company s newly authorized Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ). Each Bitech Mining Share shall be entitled
to receive shares of Series A Preferred Stock. . Effective as of June 27, 2022, the Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of Company
Common Stock following the June 27, 2022 filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company s
authorized common stock to shares. Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Sellers held, in the aggregate,
approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock on a fully diluted basis. 

The
Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes, and Bitech Mining is considered
the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in our business and operations, a discussion of
the past financial results of our predecessor, Spine Injury Solutions Inc., is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles,
the historical financial results of Bitech Mining, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered our historical
financial results. 

Prior
to March 31, 2022, we were engaged in the business of owning, developing and leasing the Quad Video Halo video recording system QVH used to record medical procedures including the collection of accounts receivables related to previously provided spine injury diagnostic
services (collectively, the QVH Business ). On June 30, 2022, we sold the assets related to the QVH Business. 

million as of June 30,
2024. These financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve
months from the date these financial statements were issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is contingent upon its ability
to obtain additional financing and to generate revenue and cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis. The Company will continue
to seek to raise additional funding through debt or equity financing during the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these
financial statements. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for
the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving these objectives.

We
have granted non-qualified stock options to employees and contractors. All non-qualified options are generally issued with an exercise
price no less than the fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant as determined by our Board of Directors. Options may be
exercised up to ten years following the date of the grant, with vesting schedules determined by us upon grant. Vesting schedules vary
by grant, with some fully vesting immediately upon grant to others that ratably vest over a period of time up to five years. Standard
vested options may be exercised up to three months following date of termination of the relationship unless alternate terms are specified
at grant. The fair values of options are determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated fair value of options
is recognized as expense on the straight-line basis over the options vesting periods. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately
 million unrecognized stock-based compensation.

unregistered shares of its common stock to Emergen s sole member, C C, an entity controlled by Cole Johnson
who became an executive officer and director of the Company following the Closing, in exchange for of Emergen s equity interests.
Following the Closing, Mr. Johnson became the President of the Company s BESS and Solar Divisions and a member of the Board. In
addition, Emergen became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company with C C s ownership interest in the Company being approximately
 based on shares of the Company s common stock outstanding after giving effect to the issuance of the shares of
Common Stock pursuant to the MIPA. 

Originally,
in a letter agreement executed and disclosed in January 2024 the above acquisition was contingent upon the parties entering into a definitive
agreement which would contain certain conditions to close, including a commitment for a capital investment or other financing transaction
of not less than (the Capital Infusion prior to closing. This Capital Infusion condition was negotiated out
of the acquisition definitive agreement. 

Emergen
holds certain contractual and other rights to develop a portfolio of battery energy storage system BESS projects identified
in the MIPA with a cumulative storage capacity estimated at 1.965 gigawatts (GW) upon completion of the construction of such project
(the BESS Development Projects and rights to develop a portfolio of solar energy development projects with a cumulative
capacity estimated at 3.840 GW upon completion of construction of such project (the Solar Development Projects, together
with the BESS Development Projects, collectively, the Development Projects ). Following the Closing, the Company will take
all commercially reasonable steps necessary to uplist the Company to the NASDAQ stock exchange. 

From
an accounting perspective, we treated the transaction as an acquisition of assets versus a business combination due to the lack of any
operations. Also, the projects that were purchased in the acquisition were development stage and deemed to not be tangible assets under
FASB 805-10-20 and have classified these as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and are not amortized but are tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. To the extent that an intangible
asset is successfully developed into a revenue-generating asset, it will become a component of property, plant and equipment. To the
extent that an intangible asset is not successfully developed into a revenue-generating assets, it will be considered impaired and charged
to operations at that time. The Company valued the transaction at the value of , the value of the restricted stock 
closing price per share on April 24, 2024) issued as consideration for Emergen. Emergen had no liabilities associated with it at the
time of the transaction. 

The
following agreements were entered into on the date of Closing as provided for in the MIPA:

the Closing, the Company and Emergen entered into a Project Management Services Agreement including amendment number one effective June

unregistered shares of its common stock to Emergen s sole member, C C, an entity controlled by Cole Johnson who became an
executive officer and director of the Company coincident with the acquisition, in exchange for 
of Emergen s equity interests. Emergen was formed just prior to the acquisition and had no business operations. Emergen held
certain contractual and other rights to develop a portfolio of battery energy storage system BESS projects
identified in the MIPA with a cumulative storage capacity estimated at 1.965 gigawatts (GW) upon completion of the construction of
such project (the BESS Development Projects and rights to develop a portfolio of solar energy development projects
with a cumulative capacity estimated at 3.840 GW upon completion of construction of such project (the Solar Development
Projects, together with the BESS Development Projects, collectively, the Development Projects ). The Development
Projects included no tangible assets, no binding contracts that would create a liability and no binding contracts for revenue
generation. The Development Projects were deemed intangible assets and we have recorded the entire value of the 
unregistered shares valued at the closing price on April 24, 2024 of as the initial measurement value. 

Intangible
assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. To the extent that an intangible asset is successfully
developed into a revenue-generating asset, it will become a component of property, plant and equipment. To the extent that an intangible
asset is not successfully developed into a revenue-generating assets, it will be considered impaired and charged to operations at that
time. The estimation of the fair value of the projects requires significant management judgment
with respect to revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate.
The estimates of the fair value of the projects are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. The use
of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an
impairment charge. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment
tests. Indicators such as adverse business conditions, economic factors and technological change or competitive activities may signal
that an asset has become impaired. 

GW of Emergen s
estimated GW of solar energy development projects. Bridgelink has sold these greenfield projects, along with projects in its own
portfolio, to an unrelated third party Purchaser which also executed that agreement on May 30, 2024. The total amount
to be received by Emergen for the projects sold to Bridgelink is , provided the projects achieve a Point of Interconnection
and subsequently obtain all Necessary Land Rights. Bridgelink retains the option to transfer or return certain or all projects within
ten (10) days written notice to Emergen if the Purchaser decides, at any time, not to go forward with development of certain or all of the projects. A deposit from Bridgelink will be received within five business days of the execution of the
agreement for and Emergen will pay to Energy Independent Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, EIP in accordance with the Project Management Services Agreement by and between (i) Bitech; shall be received
within five business days of when Bridgelink receives milestone payments from the Purchaser for these projects . This Agreement is still in effect and there have been no changes to the
Agreement. The deposit was paid to Emergen in June 2024. 

In
the event that Purchaser, under the purchase agreement decides to transfer any Project along with its interests to Bridgelink or any
creditworthy entity designated by Bridgelink Returned Project ), Bridgelink shall provide written notice to Emergen within
ten (10) business days of receipt of such notice from the Purchaser and Bridgelink shall convey, transfer, assign, deliver, and contribute
over certain rights and interests to the Returned Project to Emergen within ten (10) business days of receipt of such Returned Project,
unless otherwise agreed upon by Emergen in writing. For clarity, any creditworthy entity designated by Bridgelink shall be confirmed
in writing by Emergen. Bridgelink is to receive payment from the Purchaser no later than March 31 of the year following each calendar
yearend for any milestones that have been achieved during that calendar year. Emergen is to receive payment within five days from Bridgelink
receiving payment from the Purchaser. The Purchaser and Bridgelink can return any Project for full refund until all milestones have been
achieved and payments received by Project. 

The
Projects sold by Emergen to Bridgelink are in what are termed as a Greenfield Projects. With respect to each Greenfield Project, Emergen
will be paid: 

(i)
 per megawatt (in alternating current) measured at the Point of Interconnection after such Greenfield Project has secured all necessary
land rights as determined in good faith for the estimated megawatts sold); and 

(ii)
 per megawatt (in alternating current) measured at the Point of Interconnection when the relevant Greenfield Project has achieved
ready-to-build (RTB) status as determined in good faith for the estimated megawatts sold. 

There
is no specified timeframe for the milestones to be achieved. 

The
upfront payment that was received has been recorded as deferred revenue until there is no longer a right to return the Projects. The
remainder of the transaction is disclosed as a footnote to the financial statements but not recorded within the financial statements.
All payments that are received will be recorded as deferred revenue with proper footnote explanation of the transaction and will not
be recorded as revenue until the right Bridgelink to return the Project and request a full refund no longer exists. There are no other
sale contingencies besides those disclosed herein.

Overview
of the Business 

Currently,
we have refocused our business development plans as we seek to position ourselves as a global technology solution enabler dedicated to
providing a suite of green energy solutions with plans to develop Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) projects, commercial and residential
renewable energy solutions, enterprise utility services, public service engagements, and other renewable energy initiatives. We plan
to pursue these innovative energy technologies and become a grid-balancing operator by developing a portfolio of battery energy storage
system BESS projects with a cumulative storage capacity estimated at 1.965 gigawatts GW and rights to
develop a portfolio of solar energy development projects with a cumulative capacity estimated at 3.840 GW (collectively, the Development
Projects that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Emergen Energy LLC Emergen ). See Note 7 
Solar Projects Sale to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q discussing the recent sale of
2.45 GW estimated capacity of the 3.84 solar energy development projects. We plan to raise the working capital we need to commence the
Development Projects. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and
Capital Resources. In addition, our team has identified two highly competitive battery energy storage suppliers who have expressed interest
in establishing partnerships with us, as we seek to integrate their products into our recently acquired Development Projects. In addition,
we are seeking business partnerships with defensible technology innovators and renewable energy providers to facilitate investments,
provide new market entries toward emerging-growth regions and implement innovative, scalable energy system solutions with technological
focuses on smart grid, Home Energy Management System (HEMS), Building Energy Management System (BEMS), City Energy Management System
(CEMS), energy storage, and EV infrastructure. 

To
accelerate growth of a planned intellectual property (IP) portfolio through acquisition strategies, we plan to execute our Smart Acquisition
Model with selected acquisitions of defensible technologies accompanied with visionary management teams who can demonstrate a common
goal with us in order to unlock the full potential with capital infusion, accelerate growth. To achieve our development plans, we plan
to incubate those acquired companies toward foreseeable plans for mergers and acquisitions, formation of global joint ventures, while
facilitating new market entry to today s fastest growing Southeast Asia region. With this acquisition model, we expect to build
a valuable technology portfolio of IP assets in various innovative green energy technologies, leveraging our network of global capital
partners with low-cost manufacturing capacity and oversea outsourcing technical talents from our niche sources in Vietnam. 

Further,
we plan to execute a Dual Growth Business Model encompassing (1) IP portfolio growth which includes technology licensing or technology
acquisitions, enhanced with our plans to carry out research and development for specific applications, and (2) sustainable revenue growth
by executing planned BESS acquisitions via joint ventures with capital partners to collect joint venture income from BESS operations
or Vietnam-based manufacturing partners which can manufacture products derived from our technology solutions. 

In
light of these initiatives and other reasons noted below, the Company has, however, elected to discontinue its efforts to commercialize
the electric power generation and charging system (the Tesdison Technology it licensed from SuperGreen pursuant to the
SuperGreen License. The Company has determined that the Tesdison Technology was not functional nor was it capable of being developed
into a commercially viable product as had been represented to the Company by SuperGreen, its founder Calvin Cao, and his brother Michael
Cao, leading up to Bitech Mining entering into the SuperGreen License. In addition, the Company will temporarily pause the further development
of Intellisys-8, the Company s planned chipset and related software that had been designed to reduce power consumption and heat
in computer systems and accelerate their computational speed due to the currently unfavorable market conditions within the cryptocurrency
market. 

The
Company acquired Bitech Mining on March 31, 2022 pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement we
acquired an aggregate of 94,312,250 shares of Bitech Mining s Common Stock representing 100 of the issued and outstanding shares
of Bitech Mining in exchange for an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of the Company s newly authorized Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock. Effective June 27, 2022, each share of Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 53.975685 shares (an aggregate of
485,781,168) of the Company s Common Stock upon filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number
of the Company s authorized common stock to 1,000,000,000. Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Sellers held, in
the aggregate, approximately 96 of the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock on a fully diluted basis.

 Table of Contents 

The
Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes, and Bitech Mining is considered
the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in our business and operations, a discussion of
the past financial results of our predecessor, Spine Injury Solutions Inc., is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles,
the historical financial results of Bitech Mining, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered our historical
financial results. 

Comparison
of the three month period ended June 30, 2024 with the three month period ended June 30, 2023. 

The
Company has generated no revenues from its primary business for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred 822,900 of general and administrative expenses compared to 222,429 for the same
period in 2023. General and administrative expenses have increased primarily related to approximately 494,000 of non-cash stock
compensation expense and approximately 70,000 legal fees related to the Emergen Acquisition and 83,000 contractor fees
related to the Emergen projects. We have booked 943,500 deferred revenue related to cash received for the sale of certain solar
projects originally acquired as part of the Emergen Acquisition. 

As
a result of the foregoing, we had net loss of 822,900) for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 222,429)
for the three months ended June 30, 2023. 

Comparison
of the six month period ended June 30, 2024 with the six month period ended June 30, 2023. 

The
Company has generated minimal revenues from its primary business for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. 

During
the six months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred 1,136,735 of general and administrative expenses compared to 461,507 for the same
period in 2023. General and administrative expenses the six months ended June 30, 2024 have increased primarily related to 588,000
of non-cash stock compensation expense and the increases in the six months ended June 30, 2024 of approximately 70,000 legal fees
related to the Emergen Acquisition and 83,000 contractor fees related to the Emergen projects. We have booked 943,500
deferred revenue related to cash received for the sale of certain solar projects originally acquired as part of the Emergen Acquisition. 

As
a result of the foregoing, we had net loss of 1,136,407) for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 454,507)
which included 7,000 other income to offset the general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Working
Capital 

The
calculation of Working Capital provides additional information and is not defined under GAAP. We define Working Capital as current assets
less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under GAAP.
This information is intended to provide investors with information about our liquidity. 

Other
companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total current liabilities of 1,123,426 and 35,229, respectively, and current assets
of 1,147,684 and 163,417, respectively, to meet our current obligations. As of June 30, 2024, we had working capital of 24,258, a
decrease of working capital of 103,930 as compared to December 31, 2023, driven primarily by 943,500 deferred revenue recorded related
to cash provided from the sale of solar projects and cash used in operations offset by 396,000 from the sale of common stock. 

18 

 Table of Contents 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash provided by operations was 599,267 which primarily included the deferred revenue payment of
 943,500 offset by the net loss of approximately 1,360,000) after adjustments for stock based compensation, 588,080, and stock issued
for services, 48,397. 

We
have a history of operating losses. We have not yet achieved profitable operations and expect to incur further losses. We have funded
our operations primarily from equity financing. As of June 30, 2024, cash generated from financing activities was not sufficient to fund
our growth strategy in the short-term or long-term. The primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of the business,
including operational and development costs to develop and construct our planned BESS and Solar projects that are part of the Development
Project rights we acquired upon completion of the acquisition of Emergen. As the Development Projects are in their early phase of development,
we have not determined the amount of capital needed to complete their development or operate them until sufficient cash is generated
from their operations. The primary source of liquidity has primarily been private financing transactions. The ability to fund operations,
to make planned capital expenditures, to execute on the development and commercialization of the Development Projects depends on our
ability to raise funds from debt and/or equity financing which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and
other factors, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when
needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely
to have, a current or future effect on our results of operations or financial condition, including, and without limitation, such considerations
as liquidity and capital resources. 

Changes
in or Adoption of Accounting Practices 

There
were no material changes in or adoption of new accounting practices during the six months ended June 30, 2024.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls
and procedures. Such officers have concluded (based upon their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report) that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in this report is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based upon this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of June 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have also indicated that, upon evaluation, there were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting or other factors during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or
our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control. The design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of these inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, to our knowledge, there are no legal proceedings or regulatory actions material to us to which
we are a party, or have been a party to, or of which any of our property is or was the subject matter of, and no such proceedings or
actions are known by us to be contemplated except as provided below: 

Due
to the misrepresentations and omissions of SuperGreen, Calvin C. Cao and Michael H. Cao, among other reasons, the Company filed a complaint
in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California on February 2, 2023 against SuperGreen, Michael H. Cao, Linh T. Dao, Calvin
C. Cao and entities affiliated with them alleging fraud-concealment, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty-duty of good faith,
breach of fiduciary duty-undivided loyalty, conversion and violation of California Penal Code Sec. 496 (the Cao Lawsuit ).
This lawsuit seeks compensatory damages of at least 33.6 million, treble and punitive damages, imposition of a constructive trust over
the defendants assets, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, attorney s fees and such other relief as determined by the court. 

Effective
February 20, 2023, the Company, together with its wholly owned subsidiary Bitech Mining Corporation entered into a Confidential Settlement,
Mutual Release, and Share Transfer Agreement (the C. Cao Settlement Agreement with Calvin Cao C. Cao and
SuperGreen Energy Corporation SuperGreen, together with C. Cao, the C. Cao Parties ). The C. Cao Settlement
Agreement settles as to the C. Cao Parties, the Cao Lawsuit. Pursuant to the C. Cao Settlement Agreement, the C. Cao Parties terminated
the Patent Technology Exclusive and Non-Exclusive License Agreement between Bitech Mining Corporation and SuperGreen dated January
15, 2021 as amended on January 15, 2021 and on March 26, 2022 (the License Agreement and SuperGreen canceled 51,507,749
shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share issued by the Company to SuperGreen pursuant to the License Agreement.
In addition, the parties to the Settlement Agreement agreed to a mutual general release of liabilities against each other, refrain from
making any disparaging remarks about each other and the Company s filing a dismissal with prejudice of the Cao Lawsuit as to the
C. Cao Parties. The Settlement Agreement also contains additional covenants, representations and warranties that are customary of litigation
settlement agreements. 

On
March 6, 2023, Michael Cao and Linh Dao filed, without an attorney, a pro se Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction. 

On
April 17, 2023, the court dismissed the Cao Lawsuit without prejudice due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On April 18, 2023,
we filed a complaint against Michael H. Cao, Linh T. Dao, B B Investment Holding, LLC B B Investment and
Cory Thomason in the Orange County California Superior Court containing substantially the same allegations included in the Cao Lawsuit
filed in federal court (the Cao State Court Lawsuit ). We served Mr. Cao, Ms. Dao and B B Investment Holding, LLC
on April 26, 2023 and are continuing efforts to serve Mr. Thomason. Defendants Michael H. Cao, Linh T. Dao, B B Investment (pro
se) filed a Motion to Quash Service of Summons; Motion to Dismiss or Stay Complaint (the B B Motions ). In response
to this motion, the Company filed a Motion to Strike B B Investment s motion (the Motion to Strike ), Request
for Sanctions in Amount of 2,400 and Request for Default as to B B Investment because it is being impermissibly represented by
Michael H. Cao who is engaging in the unauthorized practice of law as to a corporate entity. On October 13, 2023, the Court granted in
part the Company s unopposed Motion to Strike, striking the B B Investment Motions and ordering B B Investment to retain
an attorney no later than October 27, 2023 or be subject to default because corporate entities are not permitted to appear in court without
an attorney. The Court denied Mr. Cao s Motion to Quash and took Linh Dao s Motion to Quash off calendar, thus keeping all
Defendants in the case. The Court ruled that Michael Cao already waived his rights to file such a motion by making a general appearance
in the case and noted that Defendants failed to appear at the hearing. On or about October 27, 2023, the Company s counsel received
an initial communication from an attorney attaching responses to the Company s complaint on behalf of Mr. Cao and B B Investment.
On November 27, 2023, Mr. Cao and B B Investment filed a Demurrer to the Complaint and Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint.
These responses to the Company s Complaint, along with the motions filed by Mr. Cao pro se , were heard on May 10, 2024.
The Company filed Oppositions to each of these motions. A Case Management Conference occurred on May 10, 2024. The Company will be supplying
additional facts and supporting documentation as requested by the court. 

Mr.
Cao served initial responses to our discovery requests, but we believed these responses were evasive and asserted unnecessary objections.
After attempting to meet and confer with Mr. Cao, we filed motions to compel further responses to our discovery requests which were heard
on December 8, 2023. The Court granted in part and denied in part our motions. Accordingly, Mr. Cao served supplemental responses and
provided responsive documents, which we have deemed sufficient. 

The
Company intends to vigorously prosecute the Cao State Court Lawsuit. We cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit, however. 

Litigation
Assessment 

We
have evaluated the foregoing Cao Lawsuit to assess the likelihood of any unfavorable outcome and to estimate, if possible, the amount
of potential loss as it relates to the litigation. Based on this assessment and estimate, which includes an understanding of our intention
to vigorously prosecute the Cao Lawsuit, we believe that the potential defenses of any of the remaining defendants lack merit, however,
and we cannot predict the likelihood of any recoveries by any of our claims against the remaining defendants. This assessment and estimate
is based on the information available to management as of the date of this Annual Report and involves a significant amount of management
judgment, including the inherent difficulty associated with assessing litigation matters in their early stages. As a result, the actual
outcome or loss may differ materially from those envisioned by the current assessment and estimate. Our failure to successfully prosecute,
defend or settle the Cao Litigation with the remaining defendants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue
and profitability and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
