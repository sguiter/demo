The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions and are based largely on our current expectations and
 projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are
 subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described under the sections in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on 10-Q. Because forward-looking
 statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The
 events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment.
 New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits hereto completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from
 any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new

. The Company plans to finance its operations and development needs with its existing cash and cash
 equivalents, additional equity and/or debt financing arrangements, and revenue primarily anticipated from the sale of FemaSeed and FemVue to support the Company s research and development activities, primarily focused on FemBloc. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
 obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, on a timely basis, or at all. If the Company is not able to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed, the Company s business, results of operations, and financial
 condition could be materially adversely impacted. 

.
 The Company expects such losses to increase over the next few years as the Company advances FemBloc through clinical development if and until FDA approval is received and is available to be marketed. 

and expects to incur additional losses
 and negative operating cash flows for at least the next twelve months. The Company s ability to meet its obligations is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and future financing transactions. Although
 management expects the Company will continue as a going concern, there is no assurance that management s plans will be successful since the availability and amount of such funding is not certain. Accordingly, substantial doubt exists about the
 Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
 recoverability of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Overview

We are a leading biomedical company focused on addressing significant unmet needs for women worldwide with a broad portfolio of in-office, accessible, and innovative therapeutic and diagnostic solutions, including
 a lead revolutionary product candidate and FDA-cleared, and Canadian and European Union approved products. Our mission is to provide women with superior minimally-invasive, non-surgical product technologies, accessible in the office, improving
 patient care and overall health economics focused on servicing the reproductive health needs for those seeking solutions for infertility issues (FemaSeed and FemVue) or permanent birth control (FemBloc). We are a woman-founded and led company
 with an expansive, internally created intellectual property portfolio with over 200 patents globally, in-house chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) and device manufacturing capabilities and proven ability to develop and commercialize
 products. Our suite of products and product candidate address what we believe are multi-billion dollar global market segments in which there has been little advancement for many years, helping women avoid pharmaceutical solutions, implants and
 surgery that can be expensive and expose women to harm.

Clinical Update

FemaSeed Our Intratubal Artificial Insemination Solution . In September 2023 we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for FemaSeed intratubal insemination. The pivotal
 clinical trial was still ongoing at the time of receiving U.S. regulatory clearance from the FDA, as a result, the study was concluded with enrollment completed in November 2023. Topline results of the clinical trial were announced in March 2024.
 The trial demonstrated pregnancy rate was 26.3 by subject (n=38) and 17.5 by cycle (n=57) after FemaSeed. In contrast, a 6.7 pregnancy rate by cycle was described in the literature for intrauterine insemination (IUI) with male factor
 infertility (greater than 1 million total motile sperm count). Although subjects were permitted to have multiple FemaSeed attempts, the majority of women who became pregnant did so after the first FemaSeed procedure. The majority of adverse
 events were reported as mild (n=133 subjects, 222 cycles). No new safety concerns were observed through the seven-week follow-up. All adverse events were consistent with those known for IUI. The approved labeling includes women or couples wishing
 to become pregnant by way of insemination. The recruitment of the commercial team began with the hire of the Chief Commercial Officer in February 2024. In March 2024, the first commercial use of FemaSeed at a former investigative site was
 announced. Build-out of our initial commercial team in the United States was completed in June 2024. In June 2024, we received EU MDR and CE Mark certification for FemaSeed and in September 2024, we announced strategic distribution partnerships
 for CE-marked products, including FemaSeed and FemVue in Spain which are anticipated to generate over 1.3 million over the next year. Concurrently with direct commercial efforts in North America (U.S. and Canada), we are exploring other
 potential strategic partners for distribution in Europe and internationally.

FemBloc Our Permanent Birth Control Solution. In June 2023 we received FDA approval of our IDE to conduct a pivotal trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FemBloc,
 our non-surgical, non-implant, in-office solution for permanent birth control. In August 2023 we announced the initiation of enrollment in the FINALE [Prospective Multi-Center Trial for FemBloc INtratubal Occlusion for TranscervicAL PErmanent
 Birth Control] pivotal trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FemBloc. This prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study design includes pregnancy rate as the primary endpoint, which will be analyzed once 401 women have
 used FemBloc for one year for permanent birth control. In addition, the study is designed as a roll-in beginning with enrollment of 50 women for a clinical readout primarily of preliminary safety data prior to enrolling the remaining subjects. An
 interim analysis of clinical data endpoints is planned once 300 women have used FemBloc for permanent birth control for one year. Follow-up will continue annually for five years post-market. All six sites permitted in the initial stage of the
 trial were announced as actively enrolling subjects in January 2024. In September 2024, we announced receipt of 510(k) clearance from FDA for FemChec, an innovative diagnostic solution for fallopian tube check. FemChec is part of the confirmation
 test utilized to confirm FemBloc success. FemChec received CE Mark approval in September 2024 and previously received regulatory approval in Canada.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of liquidity

Since our inception through September 30, 2024, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sale of our common stock and convertible preferred stock, indebtedness and, to a lesser extent,
 product revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we had 7,611,210 of cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of 122,074,573.

On July 1, 2022, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler Co. (the Sales Agent and filed a related prospectus establishing an
 at-the-market facility, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through the Sales Agent. In October 2023, the Sales Agent was authorized to sell shares of common stock for an aggregate price up to
 16.7 million pursuant to the prospectus. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock have been sold for aggregate proceeds of approximately 8.7 million under the Equity Distribution Agreement pursuant to the
 prospectus. As of September 30, 2024, the amount we are authorized to sell is subject to baby-shelf limitations. In October 2024, the Company sold 665,669 shares under this facility, resulting in gross cash proceeds of 900,317.

In April 2023, we sold an aggregate of (i) 1,318,000 shares of common stock and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,878,722 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering and, in a concurrent
 private placement, warrants to purchase up to 3,196,722 shares of common stock. Additionally, common warrants were issued to the placement agent in this transaction to purchase up to 191,803 shares of common stock as compensation for services,
 collectively the April 2023 Financing ). The purchase price per share for the common stock, pre-funded warrants was 1.22 and 1.2199, respectively. The net proceeds from the April 2023 Financing at closing were approximately 3.4 million. The
 pre-funded and common warrants in the April 2023 Financing were fully exercised for cash for additional proceeds of 3.5 million. Placement agent warrants of 68,809 remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024.

26 

Table of Contents 

In November 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors pursuant to which we sold (i) senior unsecured convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of 6,850,000,
 convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 1.18 per share, (ii) Series A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,805,083 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 1.18 per share, and (iii) Series B Warrants to
 purchase up to an aggregate of 5,805,083 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 1.475 per share (collectively, the November Private Placement ). Net proceeds from the November Private Placement were 6.3 million. If exercised for cash,
 the warrants issued in the November Private Placement could result in proceeds of up to an additional 15.4 million.

Funding requirements

Based on our current operating plan, our current cash and cash equivalents is sufficient into July 2025. However, it is not sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for twelve months from the date of these financial statements and we will
 need to obtain additional financing to fund our ongoing operations. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to be able to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and
 we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate. As a result of our
 current limited financial liquidity, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to fund our product candidate FemBloc through regulatory approval, and we anticipate needing to raise additional capital to complete the
 development and commercialization of our product candidate. However, we can give no assurances that we will be able to secure additional sources of funds to support our operations, or if such funds will be available to us, that such additional
 financing will be sufficient to meet our needs or be on terms acceptable to us. This risk may increase if economic and market conditions deteriorate. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed, we may need to terminate,
 significantly modify, or delay the development of our product candidate, or we may need to obtain funds through collaborations or otherwise on terms that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might
 otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. If we are unable to raise adequate additional capital as and when required in the future, we could be forced to cease development activities and terminate our operations, and you could
 experience a complete loss of your investment.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
 principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical
 experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
 sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material.

While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed on March 28, 2024, we
 believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.

Revenue recognition

Our policy is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of the promised goods under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-05, Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 (Topic 606), which we adopted effective January 1, 2018. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods, and we have elected to exclude amounts collected from
 customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price. We do not have multiple performance obligations in our customer orders, so revenue is recognized upon shipment of our goods based upon contractually stated pricing at
 standard payment terms ranging from 30 to 60 days. All revenue is recognized point in time and no revenue is recognized over time.

Table of Contents 

The majority of products sold directly to U.S. customers are shipped via common carrier, and the customer pays for shipping and handling and assumes control Free on Board (FOB) shipping point. Products shipped to
 our international distributors are in accordance with their respective agreements; however, the shipping terms are generally EX-Works, reflecting that control is assumed by the distributor at the shipping point. Returns are only accepted with
 prior authorization from the Company. Items to be returned must be in original unopened cartons and are subject to a 30 restocking fee. As of September 30, 2024, we have not had a history of significant returns.

Accrued expenses

We accrue expenses for estimated costs of R D activities conducted by our third-party service providers, which include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials. We record the estimated costs of
 R D activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced. These costs, at times, may be a significant component of the research and development expenses and the Company makes estimates in determining the
 accrued expense each period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accrual. These accrued R D costs are included in accrued expenses on the balance sheet and within R D expense on the statement of comprehensive loss.

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Not applicable.

Item 4. 

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are (1) recorded, processed,
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely
 decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), has evaluated the effectiveness
 of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our
 management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter
 ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over
 financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design
 of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
 provide absolute assurance that all control issues within a company are detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
 Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
 risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due
 to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. 

Legal Proceedings

From time to time we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in connection with our business. As of September 30, 2024, we have not had a history of significant legal proceedings and there are no currently
 pending actions against us. We believe that any amount, or range, of reasonably possible losses in connection with any potential actions against us in excess of established reserves, in the aggregate, will not be material to our financial
 condition or cash flows. However, losses may be material to our operating results for any particular future period, depending on the level of income for such period and the significance of any actions against us.

Item 1A. 

Risk Factors

As of the date of this report, there are no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 except as noted
 below.

There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern

There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in this offering or otherwise as and when needed, our business, financial condition and
 results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we will need to significantly modify our operational plans to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets,
 and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. Our lack of cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may
 materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital, enter into critical contractual relations with third parties and otherwise execute our development strategy.

Item 2. 

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

None.

Item 3. 

Defaults Upon Senior Securities

None.

Item 4. 

Mine Safety Disclosures

Not applicable.

Item 5. 

Other Information

During the period covered by this Quarterly Report, none of the Company s directors or executive officers have 
 or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of
 Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
