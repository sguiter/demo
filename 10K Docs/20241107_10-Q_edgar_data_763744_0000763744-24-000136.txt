 manufacturing and distribution facilities located throughout North America and Europe. 
 
 Most industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company's sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national, and regional economic conditions, consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which we sell our components, the timing of dealer orders, and the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends have been, and may in the future be, different than in prior years. Additionally, many of the optional upgrades and non-critical replacement parts for RVs are purchased outside the normal product selling season, thereby causing certain Aftermarket Segment sales to be counter-seasonal. 
 
 The Company is not aware of any significant events which occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to the filing of this report that would have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
 
 In the opinion of management, the information furnished in this Form 10-Q reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q, and therefore do not include some information necessary to conform to annual reporting requirements. Results for interim periods should not be considered indicative of results for the full year.

 Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share 
 Equity instruments excluded from diluted net earnings per share calculation as the effect would have been antidilutive 
 
 For the Company's percent convertible senior notes due 2026 (the "Convertible Notes") issued in May 2021, the dilutive effect is calculated using the if-converted method. The Company is required, pursuant to the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, dated May 13, 2021, by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Indenture"), to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion obligation (i.e., the stock price in excess of the conversion price) in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or a combination thereof. Under the if-converted method, the Company includes the number of shares required to satisfy the conversion obligation, assuming all the Convertible Notes are converted. Because the average closing price of the Company's common stock for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is used as the basis for determining the dilutive effect on earnings per share, was less than the conversion price of , all associated shares were antidilutive.

 million shares of the Company's common stock (the "Warrants"). The Warrants have a strike price of per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. For calculating the dilutive effect of the Warrants, the Company uses the treasury stock method. With this method, the Company assumes exercise of the Warrants at the beginning of the period, or at time of issuance if later, and issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise. Proceeds from the exercise of the Warrants are assumed to be used to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock at the average market price during the period. The incremental shares, representing the number of shares assumed to be received upon the exercise of the Warrants less the number of shares repurchased, are included in diluted shares. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average share price was below the Warrant strike price of per share, and therefore million shares were considered antidilutive. 
 
 In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated call option contracts on the Company's common stock (the "Convertible Note Hedge Transactions") with the Counterparties. The Company paid an aggregate amount of million to the Counterparties pursuant to the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those in the Convertible Notes, approximately million shares of the Company's common stock, the same number of shares initially underlying the Convertible Notes, at a strike price of approximately , subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions will expire upon the maturity of the Convertible Notes, subject to earlier exercise or termination. Exercise of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions would reduce the number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding, and therefore would be antidilutive.

 million, plus a holdback payment of million due on the first anniversary of the acquisition. The acquisition, which qualifies as a business combination for accounting purposes, expands the Company's furniture portfolio. The results of the acquired business have been included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income since the acquisition date, primarily in the OEM segment. The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in million of goodwill (tax deductible) and million of acquired intangible assets. As this acquisition is not considered to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, pro forma results of operations and other disclosures are not presented. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Acquisitions Foreign currency translation Net balance September 30, 2024 
 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the total consideration given in an acquisition of a business over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment annually in November, or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist.

 million revolving credit facility (of which million is available for the issuance of letters of credit (the "LC Facility") and up to million is available in approved foreign currencies). The Credit Agreement also provides for term loans (the "Term Loan") to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of million. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is December 7, 2026. The Term Loan is required to be repaid in an amount equal to percent of the original principal amount of the Term Loan for the first eight quarterly periods commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2021, percent of the original principal amount of the Term Loan for the next eight quarterly periods, and then percent of the original principal amount of the Term Loan of each additional payment until the maturity date. The Company prepaid million of principal on the Term Loan during 2023 and an additional million of principal on the Term Loan during 2024 through September 30, 2024, all of which was applied to pay in full the scheduled principal amortization payments due through December 31, 2025. The Credit Agreement also permits the Company to request an increase to the revolving and/or term loan facility by up to an additional million in the aggregate upon the approval of the lenders providing any such increase and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. 
 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement in U.S. dollars are designated from time to time by the Company as (i) base rate loans which bear interest at a base rate plus additional interest ranging from to percent percent was applicable at September 30, 2024) depending on the Company s total net leverage ratio or (ii) term benchmark loans which bear interest at term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.1 percent for an interest period selected by the Company plus additional interest ranging from percent to percent percent was applicable at September 30, 2024) depending on the Company s total net leverage ratio. Foreign currency borrowings have the same additional interest margins applicable to term benchmark loans based on the Company's total net leverage ratio. At September 30, 2024, the Company had million in issued, but undrawn, standby letters of credit under the LC Facility. A commitment fee ranging from percent to percent percent was applicable at September 30, 2024) depending on the Company's total net leverage ratio accrues on the actual daily amount that the revolving commitment exceeds the revolving credit exposure. 
 
 Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company shall not permit its net leverage ratio to exceed certain limits, shall maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio, and must meet certain other financial requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. The maximum net leverage ratio covenant limits the amount of consolidated outstanding indebtedness that the Company may incur on a trailing twelve-month EBITDA. Availability under the Company s revolving credit facility, giving effect to this limitation, was million at September 30, 2024. The Company believes the availability under the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement, along with its cash flows from operations, are adequate to finance the Company's anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Company's floating rate long-term debt under the Credit Agreement approximates the carrying value, as estimated using quoted market prices and discounted future cash flows based on similar borrowing arrangements. 
 
 Convertible Notes 
 
 On May 13, 2021, the Company issued million in aggregate principal amount of percent Convertible Notes due 2026 in a private placement to certain qualified institutional buyers, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a coupon rate of percent per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2021. The Convertible Notes will mature on May 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased, in accordance with their terms. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes was 6.2277 shares of the Company's common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The conversion rate of the Convertible Notes is subject to further adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) or upon a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the

 percent of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to percent of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes in principal amounts of 1,000 or an integral multiple thereof at a repurchase price equal to percent of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Convertible Notes to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the Indenture). 
 
 The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes, equal in right of payment with all the Company's liabilities that are not so subordinated, effectively junior to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the named trustee or the holders of at least percent of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare percent of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the outstanding Convertible Notes to be due and payable. 
 
 The Convertible Notes are not registered securities nor listed on any securities exchange but may be actively traded by qualified institutional buyers. The fair value of the Convertible Notes of million at September 30, 2024 was estimated using Level 1 inputs, as it is based on quoted prices for these instruments in active markets.

 reportable segments, the OEM Segment and the Aftermarket Segment. Intersegment sales are insignificant. 
 
 The OEM Segment, which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, manufactures and distributes a broad array of highly engineered components for the leading OEMs in the recreation and transportation markets, consisting primarily of RVs and adjacent industries, including boats; buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment, and other cargo; trucks; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing. Approximately percent of the Company's OEM Segment net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were of components for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. 
 
 The Aftermarket Segment, which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, supplies engineered components to the related aftermarket channels of the recreation and transportation products, primarily to retail dealers, wholesale distributors, and service centers, as well as direct to retail customers via the Internet. The Aftermarket Segment also includes biminis, covers, buoys, fenders to the marine industry, towing products, truck accessories, appliances, air conditioners, televisions, sound systems, tankless water heaters, and the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims. 
 
 Decisions concerning the allocation of the Company's resources are made by the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), with oversight by the Board of Directors. The CODM evaluates the performance of each segment based upon segment operating profit or loss, generally defined as income or loss before interest and income taxes. Decisions concerning the allocation of resources are also based on each segment's utilization of assets. Management of debt is a corporate function. The accounting policies of the OEM and Aftermarket Segments are the same as those described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 1 of Part I of this report, as well as the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 LCI Industries ("LCII" and collectively with its subsidiaries, the "Company," "we," "us," or "our"), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lippert Components, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Lippert Components," "LCI," or "Lippert"), supplies, domestically and internationally, a broad array of highly engineered components for the leading original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") in the recreation and transportation markets, consisting primarily of recreational vehicles ("RVs") and adjacent industries, including boats; buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment, and other cargo; trucks; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing. We also supply engineered components to the related aftermarkets of these industries, primarily by selling to retail dealers, wholesale distributors, and service centers, as well as direct to retail customers via the Internet. 
 
 We have two reportable segments, the OEM Segment and the Aftermarket Segment. Intersegment sales are insignificant. At September 30, 2024, we operated over 110 manufacturing and distribution facilities located throughout North America and Europe. See Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our segments. 
 
 Our OEM Segment manufactures and distributes a broad array of highly engineered components for the leading OEMs of RVs and adjacent industries, including boats; buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment, and other cargo; trucks; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing. Approximately 52 percent of our OEM Segment net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 were of components for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, including: 
 Steel chassis and related components Electric and manual entry steps Axles, ABS, and suspension solutions Awnings and awning accessories Slide-out mechanisms and solutions Electronic components Thermoformed bath, kitchen, and other products Appliances Vinyl, aluminum, and frameless windows Air conditioners Manual, electric, and hydraulic stabilizer and leveling systems Televisions and sound systems Entry, luggage, patio, and ramp doors Tankless water heaters Furniture and mattresses Other accessories 
 The Aftermarket Segment supplies many of these engineered components to the related aftermarket channels of the recreation and transportation products, primarily to retail dealers, wholesale distributors, and service centers, as well as direct to retail customers via the Internet. The Aftermarket Segment also includes biminis, covers, buoys, fenders to the marine industry, towing products, truck accessories, appliances, air conditioners, televisions, sound systems, tankless water heaters, and the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims. 
 
 We are executing a strategic initiative to diversify the markets we serve outside of the historical concentration within the North American RV OEM industry. Approximately 57 percent of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were generated outside of the North American RV OEM market. We believe our diversification strategy has helped offset downswings in the North American RV OEM industry, while maintaining our strong position and ability to ramp up quickly to take advantage of upswings. 
 
 Most industries where we sell products or where our products are used historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, our sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national, and regional economic conditions, consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which we sell our components, the timing of dealer orders, and the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends have been, and may in the future be, different than in prior years. Additionally, many of the optional upgrades and non-critical replacement parts for RVs are purchased outside the normal product selling season, thereby causing certain Aftermarket Segment sales to be counter-seasonal. 
 
 Negative conditions in the general economy in the United States or abroad, including conditions resulting from financial and credit market fluctuations, increased inflation and interest rates, changes in economic policy, trade uncertainty,

 including changes in tariffs, sanctions, international treaties, and other trade restrictions, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters, or global public health crises, have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the Company s business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 
 
 OEM Segment 
 
 North American Recreational Vehicle Industry 
 
 An RV is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheel travel trailers, folding camping trailers, and truck campers). 
 The annual sales cycle for the RV industry generally starts in October after the "Open House" in Elkhart, Indiana where many of the largest RV OEMs display product to RV retail dealers and ends after the conclusion of the summer selling season in September in the following calendar year. Between October and March, industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded retail sales as dealers build inventories to support anticipated sales. Between April and September, the spring and summer selling seasons, retail sales of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs have historically exceeded industry-wide wholesale shipments. 
 According to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ("RVIA"), industry-wide wholesale shipments from the United States of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, our primary RV market, increased 14 percent to 224,000 units in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, as retail dealers restocked inventories during the first nine months of 2024 compared to destocking efforts in the same period of 2023. Retail demand for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs decreased 9 percent in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Retail demand has declined from elevated post-pandemic levels, primarily driven by inflation and elevated interest rates impacting retail consumer discretionary spending. Retail demand is typically revised upward in subsequent months, primarily due to delayed RV registrations. 
 While we measure our OEM Segment RV sales against industry-wide wholesale shipment statistics, the underlying health of the RV industry is determined by retail demand. A comparison of the number of units and the year-over-year percentage change in industry-wide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RVs, as reported by Statistical Surveys, Inc., as well as the resulting estimated change in dealer inventories, for both the United States and Canada, is as follows: 
 Estimated Wholesale Retail Unit Impact on Units Change Units Change Dealer Inventories Quarter ended September 30, 2024 68,500 11 84,100 (9) (15,600) Quarter ended June 30, 2024 82,000 15 98,600 (10) (16,600) Quarter ended March 31, 2024 73,500 17 65,400 (9) 8,100 Quarter ended December 31, 2023 63,400 2 53,700 (9) 9,700 Twelve months ended September 30, 2024 287,400 11 301,800 (9) (14,400) Quarter ended September 30, 2023 61,500 (16) 92,000 (13) (30,500) Quarter ended June 30, 2023 71,600 (47) 109,100 (16) (37,500) Quarter ended March 31, 2023 62,700 (59) 71,800 (24) (9,100) Quarter ended December 31, 2022 62,000 (52) 59,100 (23) 2,900 Twelve months ended September 30, 2023 257,800 (47) 332,000 (18) (74,200) 
 According to the RVIA, industry-wide wholesale shipments of motorhome RVs in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 25 percent to 26,900 units compared to the first nine months of 2023. Retail demand for motorhome RVs in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 15 percent to 31,800 units compared to the first nine months of 2023. Retail demand has

 (Continued) 

 declined from post-pandemic elevated levels, primarily driven by inflation and higher interest rates impacting retail consumer discretionary spending. 
 
 Adjacent Industries 
 
 Our portfolio of products used in RVs can also be used in other applications, including boats; buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment, and other cargo; trucks; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing (collectively, "Adjacent Industries"). In many cases, OEM customers of the Adjacent Industries are affiliated with RV OEMs through related subsidiaries. We believe there are significant opportunities in these Adjacent Industries. 
 
 Aftermarket Segment 
 
 Many of our OEM Segment products are also sold through various aftermarket channels of the recreation and transportation markets, primarily to retail dealers, wholesale distributors, and service centers, as well as direct to retail customers via the Internet. This includes discretionary accessories and replacement service parts. We have teams dedicated to product, technical, and installation training as well as marketing support for our Aftermarket Segment customers. We also support multiple call centers to provide responses to customers for product, delivery, and technical support. This support is designed for a rapid response to critical repairs, so customer downtime is minimal. The Aftermarket Segment also includes biminis, covers, buoys, fenders to the marine industry, towing products, truck accessories, appliances, air conditioners, televisions, sound systems, tankless water heaters, and the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims. Many of the optional upgrades and non-critical replacement parts for RVs are purchased outside the normal product selling season, thereby causing certain Aftermarket Segment sales to be counter-seasonal. 
 
 According to Go RVing, estimated RV ownership in the United States as of 2021 increased to a record-high 11.2 million households. This vibrant market is a key driver for aftermarket sales, as we anticipate owners will likely upgrade their units as well as replace parts and accessories which have been subjected to normal wear and tear. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Consolidated Highlights 
 
 Consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 4.6 percent to 915.5 million, from 959.3 million in the same period of 2023. 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 35.6 million, or 1.39 per diluted share, compared to net income of 25.9 million, or 1.02 per diluted share, for the same period of 2023. 
 Consolidated operating profit during the third quarter of 2024 was 53.9 million, compared to 45.6 million in the same period of 2023. Operating profit margin was 5.9 percent in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.8 percent in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to decreases in material and freight costs. 
 The cost of steel consumed in certain of our manufactured components decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Raw material costs are subject to continued fluctuation and impact certain contractual selling prices which are indexed to select commodities. 
 In September 2024, we paid a quarterly dividend of 1.05 per share, aggregating to 26.7 million.

 OEM Segment - Third Quarter 
 
 Net sales of the OEM Segment in the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 44.0 million, compared to the same period of 2023. Net sales of components to OEMs were to the following markets for the three months ended September 30: 
 (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change RV OEMs: Travel trailers and fifth-wheels 369,212 363,573 2 Motorhomes 52,800 65,669 (20) Adjacent Industries OEMs 262,449 299,225 (12) Total OEM Segment net sales 684,461 728,467 (6) 
 
 According to the RVIA, industry-wide North American wholesale unit shipments for the three months ended September 30 were: 
 2024 2023 Change Travel trailer and fifth-wheels 68,500 61,500 11 Motorhomes 7,700 10,300 (25) 
 
 The trend in our average product content per RV produced is an indicator of our overall market share of components for new RVs. Our average product content per type of RV, calculated based upon our net sales of components to domestic RV OEMs for the different types of RVs produced for the twelve months ended September 30, divided by the industry-wide wholesale shipments of the different product mix of RVs for the same period, was: 
 Content per: 2024 2023 Change Travel trailer and fifth-wheel 5,147 5,191 (1) Motorhome 3,768 3,705 2 
 
 Our average product content per type of RV excludes international sales and sales to the Aftermarket Segment and Adjacent Industries. Content per RV is impacted by changes in selling prices for our products, market share gains, acquisitions, changes in unit mix and timing differences between wholesale production and shipments. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, travel trailer and fifth-wheel RV content declined year-over-year primarily due to an increasing shift in unit mix towards lower content single axle travel trailers and pricing decreases indexed to commodity and freight indices, partially offset by market share gains and alignment in wholesale unit production and shipments compared to wholesale unit shipments outpacing production as a result of inventory destocking efforts for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our decrease in net sales to RV OEMs during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by a 25 percent decrease in motorhome wholesale shipments and a shift in unit mix towards lower content single axle travel trailers, partially offset by a 11 percent increase in North American travel trailer and fifth-wheel wholesale shipments and market share gains. The increase in North American travel trailer and fifth-wheel wholesale shipments was primarily due to retail dealers restocking inventories during the 2024 period compared to destocking efforts in the same period of 2023. 
 
 Our decrease in net sales to OEMs in Adjacent Industries during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to lower sales to North American marine and utility trailer OEMs, driven by current dealer inventory levels, inflation, and elevated interest rates impacting retail consumers.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (Continued) 

 Operating profit of the OEM Segment was 21.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 10.7 million compared to the same period of 2023. The operating profit margin of the OEM Segment increased to 3.2 percent in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.5 percent for the same period of 2023, and was positively impacted by: 
 Decreases in material costs, which positively impacted operating profit by 23.1 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily related to decreased steel prices, lower in-bound freight costs and material sourcing strategies. 
 A decrease in warranty costs, primarily due to product quality initiatives that resulted in reduced warranty claim payments, which increased operating profit by 8.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Partially offset by: 
 The impact of fixed costs spread over decreased sales, which decreased operating profit by 4.9 million related to fixed production overhead costs and 4.7 million related to fixed selling, general, and administrative costs. 
 Decreases in selling prices, which negatively impacted operating profit by 3.0 million related to targeted products and by 1.8 million related to prices contractually tied to indices of select commodities 
 Sales mix increase of lower margin products, which negatively impacted operating profit by 1.4 million compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Amortization expense on intangible assets for the OEM Segment was 10.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 10.6 million in the same period of 2023. Depreciation expense on fixed assets for the OEM Segment was 13.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 14.8 million in the same period of 2023. 

OEM Segment Year to Date 
 
 Net sales of the OEM Segment in the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 6.8 million, compared to the same period of 2023. Net sales of components to OEMs were to the following markets for the nine months ended September 30: 
 (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change RV OEMs: Travel trailers and fifth-wheels 1,186,324 1,032,866 15 Motorhomes 185,258 206,404 (10) Adjacent Industries OEMs 867,315 1,006,378 (14) Total OEM Segment net sales 2,238,897 2,245,648

 2024 2023 Change Travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs 224,000 195,800 14 Motorhomes 26,900 35,800 (25) 
 
 Our increase in net sales to RV OEMs during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by a 14 percent increase in North American travel trailer and fifth-wheel wholesale shipments during the first nine months of 2024, partially offset by a shift in unit mix towards lower content single axle travel trailers. The increase in North American travel trailer and fifth-wheel wholesale shipments was primarily due to retail dealers restocking inventories during the 2024 period compared to destocking efforts in the same period of 2023. 
 
 Our decrease in net sales to OEMs in Adjacent Industries during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to lower sales to North American marine and utility trailer OEMs, driven by current dealer inventory levels, inflation, and elevated interest rates impacting retail consumers. 
 
 Operating profit of the OEM Segment was 105.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 76.1 million compared to the same period of 2023. The operating profit margin of the OEM Segment increased to 4.7 percent in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1.3 percent for the same period in 2023, and was positively impacted by: 
 26

 Amortization expense on intangible assets for the OEM Segment was 30.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 31.2 million in the same period of 2023. Depreciation expense on fixed assets for the OEM Segment was 41.0 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 43.8 million in the same period of 2023. 

Aftermarket Segment - Third Quarter 
 
 Net sales of the Aftermarket Segment in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 0.2 million, compared to the same period of 2023. Net sales of components in the Aftermarket Segment were as follows for the three months ended September 30: 
 (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change Total Aftermarket Segment net sales 231,036 230,848 
 
 Net sales of the Aftermarket Segment for the third quarter of 2024 were slightly higher than for the same period in 2023, primarily driven by market share gains in the automotive aftermarket, partially offset by lower volumes within the RV aftermarket, which has been negatively impacted by lower consumer discretionary spending. 
 
 Operating profit of the Aftermarket Segment was 32.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 2.4 million compared to the same period of 2023. The operating profit margin of the Aftermarket Segment was 13.9 percent in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 14.9 percent in the same period in 2023, and was negatively impacted by: 
 Increases in production labor costs due to product mix, which negatively impacted operating profit by 3.0 million compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Increased production facility costs resulting from investments to expand capacity in the automotive aftermarket over the past year, which reduced operating profit by 2.5 million. 
 Partially offset by: 
 Decreases in material costs, which positively impacted operating profit by 1.9 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily related to decreased steel prices, lower in-bound freight costs and material sourcing strategies. 
 Pricing changes to targeted products, resulting in an increase in operating profit of 1.4 million compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Amortization expense on intangible assets for the Aftermarket Segment was 3.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, consistent with the same period of 2023. Depreciation expense on fixed assets for the Aftermarket Segment was 4.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.0 million in the same period of 2023.

LCI INDUSTRIES 
 ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (Continued) 

 Net sales of the Aftermarket Segment decreased during the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by lower volumes within the RV and marine aftermarkets, which have been negatively impacted by lower consumer discretionary spending, partially offset by market share gains in the automotive aftermarket. 
 Operating profit of the Aftermarket Segment was 96.9 million in the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 5.2 million compared to the same period of 2023. The operating profit margin of the Aftermarket Segment was 13.9 percent in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 13.1 percent in the same period in 2023, and was positively impacted by: 
 Decreases in material costs, which positively impacted operating profit by 14.5 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily related to decreased steel prices, lower in-bound freight costs and material sourcing strategies. 
 Pricing changes to targeted products, resulting in an increase in operating profit of 5.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Partially offset by: 
 Increases in production labor costs due to product mix, which negatively impacted operating profit by 7.5 million compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Increased production facility costs resulting from investments to expand capacity in the automotive aftermarket over the past year, which reduced operating profit by 5.0 million. 
 Amortization expense on intangible assets for the Aftermarket Segment was 11.7 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 11.6 million in the same period of 2023. Depreciation expense on fixed assets for the Aftermarket Segment was 12.9 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 12.1 million in the same period of 2023. 

Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense, net was 23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 31.0 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to net repayments of 47.4 million on the revolving credit facility in the second half of 2023 and 1.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, principal prepayments on our Term Loan (as defined in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) of 37.5 million in the second half of 2023 and 25.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and interest income of 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by higher global interest rates on our adjustable rate debt including the Term Loan and revolving credit facility. See Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our credit facilities. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 25.2 percent and 25.9 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the Federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes, foreign taxes, and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation as a component of the provision for income taxes, and Federal and Indiana research and development credits. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a reduction in effective state tax rates. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 We maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to meet our cash needs in the short term. Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain our financial condition, and maintain flexibility for our future strategic investments. We continuously assess our capital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt and lease maturity schedules, capital expenditure requirements, dividends, future investments or acquisitions, and potential share repurchases. We believe our operating cash flows, credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our future payments and long-term initiatives. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 161.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and 383.1 million of availability under our revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We also have the ability to request an increase to the revolving and/or incremental term loan facilities by

 (Continued) 

 up to an additional 400.0 million in the aggregate upon approval of the lenders providing any such increase and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. See Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our credit facilities. 
 
 We believe the availability under the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement, along with our cash flows from operations, are adequate to finance our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. 
 
 The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows reflect the following for the nine months ended September 30: 
 
 (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash flows provided by operating activities 263,688 389,263 Net cash flows used in investing activities (50,566) (71,627) Net cash flows used in financing activities (117,188) (333,447) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (907) (446) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 95,027 (16,257) 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities were 263.7 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 389.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the net change in assets and liabilities, net of acquired businesses, as it used 189.8 million more cash in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The net change in assets and liabilities was partially offset by an increase in net income of 66.7 million. The primary use of cash in net assets was the increase of 102.1 million in accounts receivable due to seasonally higher sales in the first nine months of 2024. While we continued to reduce inventory in the first nine months of 2024, the larger decrease in inventory in the first nine months of 2023 was due to initiatives to reduce inventory as RV production demand slowed from record levels seen during the first half of 2022 and decreasing commodity and freight costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization was 96.0 million in the first nine months of 2024, and is expected to be approximately 125 to 135 million for the full year 2024. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense in the first nine months of 2024 was 14.0 million. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately 17 to 22 million for the full year 2024. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used in investing activities of 50.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 were primarily comprised of 31.4 million for capital expenditures and 20.0 million for the acquisition of a business. Cash flows used in investing activities of 71.6 million in the first nine months of 2023 were primarily comprised of 50.1 million for capital expenditures and 25.9 million for the acquisitions of businesses. 
 Our capital expenditures are primarily for replacement and growth. Over the long term, based on our historical capital expenditures, the replacement portion has averaged approximately one to two percent of net sales, while the growth portion has averaged approximately two to three percent of net sales. However, there are many factors that can impact the actual spending compared to these historical averages. We estimate full year 2024 capital expenditures of 35 to 45 million, including investments in automation and lean projects. 
 Capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses in the first nine months of 2024 were funded by cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Capital expenditures and any acquisitions in the remainder of fiscal year 2024 are expected to be funded primarily from cash generated from operations, as well as periodic borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash flows used in financing activities of 117.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 were primarily comprised of payments of quarterly dividends of 80.2 million, net debt repayments of 27.9 million under our revolving credit facility, Term Loan, and other borrowings, and cash outflows of 9.1 million related to vesting of stock-based awards, net of shares tendered for payment of taxes.

 (Continued) 

 Cash flows used in financing activities of 333.4 million in the first nine months of 2023 were primarily comprised of 165.7 million in net repayments under our revolving credit facility, payments of quarterly dividends of 79.7 million, 45.8 million in repayments under our Term Loan and other borrowings, 31.9 million related to payments of contingent consideration and holdbacks related to acquisitions, and cash outflows of 9.6 million related to vesting of stock-based awards, net of shares tendered for payment of taxes. 
 The Credit Agreement includes both financial and non-financial covenants. The covenants dictate we shall not permit our net leverage ratio to exceed certain limits, shall maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio, and must meet certain other financial requirements. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. 
 We have paid regular quarterly dividends since 2016. Future dividend policy with respect to our common stock will be determined by our Board of Directors considering our prevailing financial needs, earnings, and other relevant factors, including any limitations in our debt agreements, such as maintenance of certain financial ratios. 
 In May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to 200.0 million of our common stock over a three-year period ending on May 19, 2025. No shares were repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there was 175.9 million remaining under the stock repurchase program. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
 
 We are in compliance with the corporate governance requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Our governance documents and committee charters and key practices have been posted to the Investors section of our website www.lci1.com and are updated periodically. The website also contains, or provides direct links to, all SEC filings, press releases and investor presentations. We have also established a Whistleblower Policy, which includes a toll-free hotline (800-461-9330) to report complaints about our accounting, internal controls, auditing matters or other concerns. The Whistleblower Policy and procedure for complaints can be found on our website www.lci1.com ). 
 
 CONTINGENCIES 
 
 Information required by this item is included in Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 RAW MATERIALS INFLATION 
 
 The prices of key raw materials, consisting primarily of steel and aluminum, and components used by us which are made from these raw materials, are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities, as well as by inflationary pressures. We experienced reduced prices of these commodities in the first nine months of 2024, but prices of these commodities have historically been volatile. As a result, while we currently expect commodity prices for the remainder of the year to remain generally consistent with the third quarter of 2024, there can be no assurance that raw material costs will not increase. Please see "Results of Operations" above for additional information regarding the impact of raw material costs on our results of operations for the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 Information required by this item is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to product returns, sales and purchase rebates, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets, net assets of acquired businesses, income taxes, warranty and product recall obligations, self-insurance obligations, operating lease right-of-use assets and obligations, asset retirement obligations, long-lived assets, pension and post-retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, segment allocations, contingent consideration, environmental

 liabilities, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience, other available information, and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other resources. Actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates. 
 
 For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as described in that Annual Report. 
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Form 10-Q contains certain "forward-looking statements" with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, profitability, margins, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive position, growth opportunities, acquisitions, plans and objectives of management, markets for the Company's common stock, the impact of legal proceedings, and other matters. Statements in this Form 10-Q that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" for the purpose of the safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. 
 
 Forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to the Company's production levels, future business prospects, net sales, expenses and income (loss), capital expenditures, tax rate, cash flow, financial condition, liquidity, covenant compliance, retail and wholesale demand, integration of acquisitions, R D investments, commodity prices, addressable markets, and industry trends, whenever they occur in this Form 10-Q, are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of the Company's senior management at the time such statements were made. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company s control, which could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, in addition to other matters described in this Form 10-Q, the impacts of future pandemics, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, or natural disasters on the global economy and on the Company's customers, suppliers, employees, business and cash flows, pricing pressures due to domestic and foreign competition, costs and availability of, and tariffs on, raw materials (particularly steel and aluminum) and other components, seasonality and cyclicality in the industries to which we sell our products, availability of credit for financing the retail and wholesale purchase of products for which we sell our components, inventory levels of retail dealers and manufacturers, availability of transportation for products for which we sell our components, the financial condition of our customers, the financial condition of retail dealers of products for which we sell our components, retention and concentration of significant customers, the costs, pace of, and successful integration of acquisitions and other growth initiatives, availability and costs of production facilities and labor, team member benefits, team member retention, realization and impact of expansion plans, efficiency improvements and cost reductions, the disruption of business resulting from natural disasters or other unforeseen events, the successful entry into new markets, the costs of compliance with environmental laws, laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, other operational and financial risks related to conducting business internationally, and increased governmental regulation and oversight, information technology performance and security, the ability to protect intellectual property, warranty and product liability claims or product recalls, interest rates, oil and gasoline prices, and availability, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on the retail sale of products for which we sell our components, and other risks and uncertainties discussed more fully under the caption "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in the Company's subsequent filings with the SEC, including the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Readers of this report are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, since there can be no assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made, except as required by law.

 ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE 
 DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in short-term interest rates on our variable rate debt. Depending on the interest rate option selected as further described in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, interest is charged based on an indexed rate plus an applicable margin. Assuming a hypothetical increase of 0.25 percent in the indexed interest rate (which approximates an eight percent increase of the weighted-average interest rate on our borrowings as of September 30, 2024), our results of operations would not be materially affected. 
 We are also exposed to changes in the prices of raw materials, specifically steel and aluminum. We have, from time to time, entered into derivative instruments for the purpose of managing a portion of the exposures associated with fluctuations in steel and aluminum prices. While these derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, these fluctuations are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the underlying exposures. We had no outstanding derivative instruments on commodities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 We have historically been able to obtain sales price increases to partially offset the majority of raw material cost increases. However, there can be no assurance future cost increases, if any, can be partially or fully passed on to customers, or that the timing of such sales price increases will match raw material cost increases. 
 Additional information required by this item is included under the caption "Raw Materials Inflation" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this report. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 a. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, in accordance with the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Management included in its evaluation the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We continually evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures to determine if changes are appropriate based upon changes in our operations or the business environment in which we operate. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 b. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In the normal course of business, we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, regulatory agency inquiries and other claims. All such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. While these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods, it is management s opinion that after final disposition, including anticipated insurance recoveries in certain cases, any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company beyond that provided in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, would not be material to our financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes to the matters discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024.
