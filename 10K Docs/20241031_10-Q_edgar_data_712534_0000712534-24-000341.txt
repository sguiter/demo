 FASB Accounting Standards Update - No. 2023-09 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
 Summary - The FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures in the fourth quarter of 2023. This ASU is intended to enhance income tax disclosures to address investor requests for more information about the tax risks and opportunities present in an entity s worldwide operations. 
 
 The two primary enhancements disaggregate existing income tax disclosures related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. These amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The amendments also require that all entities disclose on an annual basis the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). 
 
 For public business entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issue. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The Corporation is assessing the terms of this guidance, but adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Corporation s financial statements or disclosures.

State and municipal U.S. Government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities Corporate obligations Total available for sale 
 
 The following tables summarize the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, approximate fair value and allowance for credit losses on investment securities held to maturity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Amortized Cost Allowance for Credit Losses Net Carrying Amount Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Held to maturity at September 30, 2024 U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities State and municipal U.S. Government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities Foreign investment Total held to maturity 

Amortized Cost Allowance for Credit Losses Net Carrying Amount Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Held to maturity at December 31, 2023 U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities State and municipal U.S. Government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities Foreign investment Total held to maturity 

Accrued interest on investment securities available for sale and held to maturity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of million and million, respectively, are included in the Interest Receivable line on the Corporation's Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The total amount of accrued interest is excluded from the amortized cost of available for sale and held to maturity securities presented above. 
 
 In determining the allowance for credit losses on investment securities available for sale that are in an unrealized loss position, the Corporation first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through the income statement. For investment securities available for sale that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Corporation evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Corporation considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive loss. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses. The Corporation has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on investment securities available for sale from the estimate of credit losses. Investment securities available for sale are charged off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through the income statement when deemed uncollectible or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. The Corporation did not record an allowance for credit losses on its investment securities available for sale as the unrealized losses were attributable to changes in interest rates, not credit quality.

The unrealized losses in the Corporation s investment portfolio were the result of changes in interest rates and not credit quality. As a result, the Corporation expects to recover the amortized cost basis over the term of the securities. The Corporation does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. 
 
 Fair value Gross unrealized losses Percentage of the Corporation's investment securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position 

In determining the fair value of the investment securities portfolio, the Corporation utilizes a third party for portfolio accounting services, including market value input, for those securities classified as Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Corporation has obtained an understanding of what inputs are being used by the vendor in pricing the portfolio and how the vendor classified these securities based upon these inputs. From these discussions, the Corporation s management is comfortable that the classifications are proper. The Corporation has gained trust in the data for two reasons: (a) independent spot testing of the data is conducted by the Corporation through obtaining market quotes from various brokers on a periodic basis; and (b) actual gains or losses resulting from the sale of certain securities has proven the data to be accurate over time. Fair value of securities classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy was determined using a discounted cash flow model that incorporated market estimates of interest rates and volatility in markets that have not been active.

 Credit Quality 
 As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of the Corporation's loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to: (i) the level of criticized commercial loans, (ii) net charge-offs, (iii) nonperforming loans, (iv) covenant failures and (v) the general national and local economic conditions. 
 
 The Corporation utilizes a risk grading of pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss to assess the overall credit quality of large commercial loans. All large commercial credit grades are reviewed at a minimum of once a year for pass grade loans. Loans with grades below pass are reviewed more frequently depending on the grade. A description of the general characteristics of these grades is as follows: 
 
 Pass - Loans that are considered to be of acceptable credit quality. 
 
 Special Mention - Loans which possess some credit deficiency or potential weakness, which deserves close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Corporation's credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Corporation to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
 
 Substandard - Loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified have a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful - Loans that have all of the weaknesses of those classified as Substandard. However, based on existing facts, conditions and values, these weaknesses make full collection of principal highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Loss Loans that are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuing to carry them as an asset is not warranted. Loans will be classified as Loss when it is neither practical or desirable to defer charging-off or reserving all or a portion of a basically worthless asset, even though partial recovery may be possible at some time in the future.

 Loans are reclassified to a nonaccruing status when, in management s judgment, the collateral value and financial condition of the borrower do not justify accruing interest. At the time the accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against earnings. Interest income accrued in prior years, if any, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Payments subsequently received on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal. A loan is returned to accrual status when principal and interest are no longer past due and collectability is probable, typically after a minimum of six consecutive months of performance.

 Determining fair value for collateral dependent loans requires obtaining a current independent appraisal of the collateral and applying a discount factor, which includes selling costs if applicable, to the value. The fair value of real estate is generally based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. The appraisers typically determine the value of the real estate by utilizing an income or market valuation approach. If an appraisal is not available, the fair value may be determined by using a cash flow analysis. Fair value on other collateral such as business assets is typically ascertained by assessing, either singularly or some combination of, asset appraisals, accounts receivable aging reports, inventory listings and or customer financial statements. Both appraised values and values based on borrower s financial information are discounted as considered appropriate based on age and quality of the information and current market conditions.

million and million, respectively, on loans to borrowers whose loans were modified due to financial difficulties within the previous twelve months. The payment defaults did not materially impact the allowance for credit losses on loans. There were payment defaults during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 on loans that had been modified within the previous twelve months. 
 
 Upon the Corporation's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or portion of the loan) is charged-off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 
 The Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans ("ACL - Loans") is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on loans over the contractual term. The ACL - Loans is adjusted by the provision for credit losses, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by charge-offs for loans, net of recoveries. Provision for credit losses on loans reflects the totality of actions taken on all loans for a particular period including any necessary increases or decreases in the allowance related to changes in credit loss expectations associated with specific loans or pools of loans. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when the uncollectibility of the loan is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. 
 
 The allowance represents the Corporation s best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans using relevant available information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. The CECL calculation is performed and evaluated quarterly and losses are estimated over the expected life of the loan. The level of the allowance for credit losses is believed to be adequate to absorb all expected future losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the measurement date. 
 
 In calculating the allowance for credit losses, the loan portfolio was pooled into loan segments with similar risk characteristics. Common characteristics include the type or purpose of the loan, underlying collateral and historical/expected credit loss patterns. In developing the loan segments, the Corporation analyzed the degree of correlation in how loans within each portfolio respond when subjected to varying economic conditions and scenarios as well as other portfolio stress factors. 
 
 The expected credit losses are measured over the life of each loan segment utilizing the Probability of Default / Loss Given Default methodology combined with economic forecast models to estimate the current expected credit loss inherent in the loan portfolio. This approach is also leveraged to estimate the expected credit losses associated with unfunded loan commitments incorporating expected utilization rates. 
 
 The Corporation sub-segmented certain commercial portfolios by risk level and certain consumer portfolios by delinquency status where appropriate. The Corporation utilized a four-quarter reasonable and supportable economic forecast period followed by a six-quarter, straight-line reversion period to the historical macroeconomic mean for the remaining life of the loans. Econometric modeling was performed using historical default rates and a selection of economic forecast scenarios published by Moody s to develop a range of estimated credit losses for which to determine the best credit loss estimate within. Macroeconomic factors utilized in the modeling process include the national unemployment rate, BBB US corporate index, Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") price index and the home price index. 
 
 The Corporation qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not inherently considered in the quantitative modeling process, but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan portfolio. These adjustments may increase or decrease the estimate of expected credit losses based upon the assessed level of risk for each qualitative factor. The various risks that may be considered in making qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, (ii) changes in the existence, growth and effect of any concentrations in credit, (iii) changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, charge-offs, and recoveries, (iv) changes in the quality of the credit review function, (v) changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending, investment, collection and other relevant management staff, (vi) changes in the volume and severity of past due financial assets, the volume of the nonaccrual assets, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets, (vii) the value of underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral dependent, and (viii) other environmental factors such as regulatory, legal and technological considerations, as well as competition and changes in the economic and business conditions that affect the collectibility of financial assets. At CECL adoption, the Corporation established certain qualitative factors that were expected to correlate to losses within the loan portfolio. During a scheduled review of qualitative factors in 2023, the Corporation determined there had not been significant evidence of correlation to losses for the qualitative factors that included i) changes in experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff; ii) changes in lending policies and procedures; iii) changes in the quality of the credit review function; iv) portfolio mix and growth; and v) industry concentration. The Corporation decided to refine these qualitative factors in order to improve our ability to assess related risk and enhance our ability to correlate to losses. The Corporation s evaluation of the qualitative approach resulted in an insignificant change to the ACL Loans estimate. 
 
 In some cases, management may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate the loan from other loans within the loan segments. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific reserve allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry, among other things. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. The fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans is evaluated on a quarterly basis.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments And Contingencies 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Corporation has entered into off-balance sheet financial instruments which include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are usually the result of lines of credit granted to existing borrowers under agreements that the total outstanding indebtedness will not exceed a specific amount during the term of the indebtedness. Typical borrowers are commercial customers that use lines of credit to supplement their treasury management functions, and thus their total outstanding indebtedness may fluctuate during any time period based on the seasonality of their business and the resultant timing for their cash flows. Other typical lines of credit are related to home equity loans granted to customers. Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require a fee. 
 
 Standby letters of credit are generally issued on behalf of an applicant (the Corporation s customer) to a specifically named beneficiary and are the result of a particular business arrangement that exists between the applicant and the beneficiary. Standby letters of credit have fixed expiration dates and are usually for terms of or less unless terminated beforehand due to criteria specified in the standby letter of credit. The standby letter of credit would permit the beneficiary to obtain payment from the Corporation under certain prescribed circumstances. Subsequently, the Corporation would seek reimbursement from the applicant pursuant to the terms of the standby letter of credit. 
 
 The Corporation typically follows the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer s creditworthiness is typically evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include cash, real estate, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and personal property. The contractual amounts of these commitments are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements and only amounts drawn upon would be reflected in the future. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should the Corporation s customers default on their resulting obligation to the Corporation, the maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those commitments. 
 
 Standby letters of credit 
 
 The Corporation maintains an accrual for credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments using the CECL methodology. Reserves for unfunded commitments declined by million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was no change in the reserve for unfunded commitments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. This reserve level remains appropriate and is reported in Other Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.

 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.

 Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Corporation's variable-rate liabilities.

 Non-designated Hedges 
 
 The Corporation does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Corporation provides to certain customers. The Corporation executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Corporation executes with a third party, such that the Corporation minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. 
 
 Commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors are considered derivatives. It is the Corporation's practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. These mortgage banking derivatives are not designated in hedge relationships. Fair values were estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the commitments. Changes in the fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives are included in net gains and fees on sales of loans.

 The Corporation s exposure to credit risk occurs because of nonperformance by its counterparties. The counterparties approved by the Corporation are usually financial institutions, which are well capitalized and have credit ratings through Moody s and/or Standard Poor s at or above investment grade. The Corporation s mitigation of such risk is through quarterly financial reviews, comparing mark-to-market values with policy limitations, credit ratings and collateral pledging. 
 
 Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
 
 The Corporation has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Corporation fails to maintain its status as a well or adequately capitalized institution, then the Corporation could be required to terminate or fully collateralize all outstanding derivative contracts. Additionally, the Corporation has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Corporation defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Corporation could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position related to these agreements was million, which resulted in million of collateral pledged to counterparties as of September 30, 2024. While the Corporation did not breach any of these provisions as of September 30, 2024, if it had, the Corporation could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value.

Collateral Dependent Loans 
 
 Determining fair value for collateral dependent loans requires obtaining a current independent appraisal of the collateral and applying a discount factor, which includes selling costs if applicable, to the value. The fair value of real estate is generally based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. The appraisers typically determine the value of the real estate by utilizing an income or market valuation approach. If an appraisal is not available, the fair value may be determined by using a cash flow analysis. Fair value on other collateral such as business assets is typically ascertained by assessing, either singularly or some combination of, asset appraisals, accounts receivable aging reports, inventory listings and or customer financial statements. Both appraised values and values based on borrower s financial information are discounted as considered appropriate based on age and quality of the information and current market conditions.

The following is a discussion of the sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs, the interrelationships between those inputs and other unobservable inputs used in recurring fair value measurement and how those inputs might magnify or mitigate the effect of changes in the unobservable inputs on the fair value measurement. 
 
 State and Municipal Securities, Corporate Obligations and U.S. Government-sponsored Mortgage-Backed Securities 
 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation's state and municipal securities, corporate obligations and U.S. Government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities are premiums for unrated securities and marketability discounts. Significant increases or decreases in either of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. Generally, changes in either of those inputs will not affect the other input.

The RSAs vest only if the employee is actively employed by the Corporation on the vesting date and, therefore, any unvested shares are forfeited. For non-employee directors, the RSAs vest only if the non-employee director remains as an active board member on the vesting date and, therefore, any unvested shares are forfeited. The RSAs for employees and non-employee directors are either immediately vested at retirement, disability or death, or, continue to vest after retirement, disability or death, depending on the plan under which the shares were granted. 
 
 The Corporation s 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") provides eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries an opportunity to purchase shares of common stock of the Corporation through quarterly offerings financed by payroll deductions. The price of the stock to be paid by the employees shall be equal to percent of the average of the closing price of the Corporation s common stock on each trading day during the offering period. However, in no event shall such purchase price be less than the lesser of an amount equal to percent of the market price of the Corporation s stock on the offering date or an amount equal to percent of the market value on the date of purchase. Common stock purchases are made quarterly and are paid through advance payroll deductions up to a calendar year maximum of . The 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan expired on June 30, 2024. 
 
 Compensation expense related to unvested share-based awards is recorded by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards, with no change in historical reported fair values and earnings. Awards are valued at

Share-based compensation has been recognized as a component of salaries and benefits expense in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. 
 
 Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Share-based compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Pre-vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on historical experience.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require us to apply significant judgments to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Management must use assumptions and estimates to apply those principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical. The judgments and assumptions made are based upon historical experience or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions, actual results could differ from estimates, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the items disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 As of September 30, 2024, total assets equaled 18.3 billion, a decrease from the December 31, 2023 total of 18.4 billion. 
 
 Cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits decreased 104.9 million from December 31, 2023.

The Corporation s ACL - loans totaled 187.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and equaled 1.48 percent of total loans, compared to 204.9 million and 1.64 percent of total loans at December 31, 2023. The ACL - loans decreased 17.1 million from December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded net charge-offs of 6.7 million and 48.6 million, respectively, and 5.0 million and 31.5 million of provision for credit losses - loans, for the same periods respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Corporation recorded net charge-offs of 20.4 million and 22.5 million, respectively, and 2.0 million of provision for credit losses - loans for both periods. Nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2024 were 59.1 million and increased 5.5 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to an 11.4 million increase in non-accrual balances in commercial real estate, non-owner occupied. The increases were partially offset by a decline in non-accrual balances within the residential loan portfolio of 6.2 million.The Corporation's reserve for unfunded commitments was 19.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and is recorded in Other Liabilities. Additional details of the Corporation's allowance methodology and asset quality are discussed within NOTE 4. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and within the LOAN QUALITY AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The Corporation's other assets increased 26.1 million from December 31, 2023 and was driven by the Corporation's continued investment in qualified affordable housing projects. Additionally, the fair value of derivatives included in other assets decreased from 79.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 62.3 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease in derivatives is due primarily to a decrease in market interest rates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, total deposits equaled 14.4 billion, a decrease of 456.4 million from December 31, 2023, or 4.1 percent on an annualized basis. The decline was primarily due to 287.7 million of deposits being reclassified as held for sale related to the Illinois branch sale. The loan to deposit ratio increased to 88.0 at period end from 84.4 as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to the reclassification 
 of deposits to held for sale as previously described. Excluding the deposits reclassified to held for sale, the Corporation experienced decreases from December 31, 2023 in demand deposits of 140.0 million, savings accounts of 168.8 million and time deposits of 83.2 million. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in brokered deposits of 223.3 million from December 31, 2023. Total deposits less time deposits greater than 100,000, or core deposits, represented 89.3 percent of the deposit portfolio at September 30, 2024. Noninterest bearing deposits represents 16.2 percent of the deposit portfolio at September 30, 2024, compared to 16.9 percent at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The average account balance within the deposit portfolio was 34,000 at September 30, 2024. Insured deposits totaled 68.9 percent of total deposits, with the State of Indiana's Public Deposit Insurance Fund, which insures certain public deposits, providing insurance to 13.8 percent of deposits and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") providing insurance to the remaining 55.1 percent. Only 31.1 percent of deposits are uninsured and our available liquidity is ample to cover those when considering both on balance sheet sources of liquidity and unused capacity from the Federal Reserve Discount Window, FHLB and unsecured borrowing sources. 
 
 Total borrowings increased 52.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of 30.0 million in federal funds purchased and an increase of 119.8 million in FHLB advances from December 31, 2023. Subordinated debentures and other borrowings decreased 65.1 million compared to December 31, 2023 as the Corporation utilized excess liquidity to pay down 65.0 million of subordinated debentures in the first half of the year. Securities sold under repurchase agreements decreased 32.4 million from December 31, 2023 as clients moved into higher yielding deposit products. 
 
 The Corporation continued to maintain all regulatory capital ratios in excess of the regulatory definition of well-capitalized. Details of the Stock Repurchase Program and regulatory capital ratios are discussed within the CAPITAL section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 The Corporation's accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. As a supplement to GAAP, the Corporation provides non-GAAP performance measures, which management believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Corporation's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the following tables. 
 
 Adjusted earnings per share, excluding PPP loans and non-core expenses, are meaningful non-GAAP financial measures for management, as they provide a meaningful foundation for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will aid both investors and analysts in analyzing our financial measures and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of the Corporation's business, because management does not consider these items to be relevant to ongoing financial performance on a per share basis. 
 
 Net interest income and net interest margin presented on a fully taxable equivalent ("FTE") basis, reflecting the income tax savings when comparing tax-exempt and taxable assets using the federal statutory rate of 21 percent, are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to assess what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset. Management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis and that it provides useful information for management and investors for peer comparison purposes.

Non-GAAP financial measures such as tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible earnings per share, return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible equity are important measures of the strength of the Corporation's capital and ability to generate earnings on tangible common equity invested by our shareholders. These non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information and may assist investors in analyzing the Corporation s financial position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock, but do retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive losses in stockholders' equity. Disclosure of these measures also allows analysts and banking regulators to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases.

NET INTEREST INCOME 
 
 Net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, comprising 82.4 percent of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on loan and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities. Funding from customer deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources. Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve Board monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments, can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding and the net interest income and margin.

PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is also presented on an FTE basis in the table that follows to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset. The federal statutory rate of 21 percent was used for 2024 and 2023. The FTE analysis portrays the income tax benefits associated with tax-exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Therefore, management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons. For reconciliations of GAAP net interest margin to the corresponding non-GAAP measures provided below, refer to the "NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 Net interest margin, on an FTE basis, decreased 6 basis points to 3.23 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.29 percent for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net interest margin, on an FTE basis, decreased 26 basis points to 3.16 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.42 percent for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Average Balance Sheet 
 Average earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 42.7 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by average loan growth of 392.5 million, primarily in the commercial and real estate mortgage portfolios. The loan growth was offset by a decrease in the average interest-bearing deposits and investment securities portfolio of 250.9 million and 98.9 million, respectively, as the Corporation utilized liquidity to fund loan growth. Additionally, the Corporation repositioned the available for sale securities portfolio and sold 158.9 million of securities during the third quarter of 2024 with a weighted average tax-equivalent yield of 2.85 percent. 
 
 Average earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 128.6 million compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in interest bearing deposits of 42.1 million as well as organic loan growth within the real estate mortgage and commercial portfolios of 150.9 million and 143.9 million, respectively. Offsetting the increases in interest-bearing deposits and loans was a decrease in the average investment securities portfolio of 242.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The Corporation is repositioning the available for sale securities portfolio with a primary focus of using liquidity to fund current and future loan growth and reinvest at higher market rates. The investment portfolio as a percentage of total assets was 20.0 percent at September 30, 2024, which is down from the peak at December 31, 2021 of 29.3 percent, and reflects progress towards a more normalized earning asset mix. 
 
 Total average deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 33.1 million, when compared to the same period in 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 256.3 million compared to the same period in 2023, with the largest increase in certificates and other time deposits, offset by a decrease in savings deposits. Noninterest bearing deposits act to mitigate deposit yield increases as interest rates rise. Average noninterest bearing deposits declined 289.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Average noninterest bearing deposits represented 16.0 percent of the deposit portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 17.9 percent of the deposit portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which is a decline from the peak in the second quarter of 2022 of 23.6 percent. 
 
 Total average deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 198.6 million, when compared to the same period in 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 674.0 million, compared to the same period in 2023, with the largest increase in the certificates and other time deposits, offset by a decrease in savings deposits. Average noninterest bearing deposits declined 475.4 million, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is the result of a mix shift occurring across the industry as clients move into higher yielding deposit products. Average noninterest bearing deposits, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, represented 16.0 percent and 19.5 percent of the deposit portfolio, respectively. 
 
 Average borrowings increased 39.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Average FHLB advances and federal funds purchased increased 109.9 million and 19.3 million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 as the Corporation utilized funding sources to fund loan growth. These increases were offset by a 29.6 million decrease in average securities sold under repurchase agreements for the same period. Additionally, average subordinated debt decreased 64.9 million for the three months ended September 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, due to the Corporation's redemption of 65.0 million of subordinated debt in the first and second quarters of 2024. 
 
 Average borrowings decreased 154.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Average securities sold under repurchase, FHLB advances and Federal Funds purchased decreased 43.0 million, 42.3 million and 25.3 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average subordinated debt decreased 50.9 million due to the Corporation's redemption of 65.0 million of subordinated debt during the year.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Interest Income/Expense and Average Yields 
 In the third quarter of 2024, FTE asset yields increased 27 basis points compared to the same period in 2023 and was primarily due to Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") increasing interest rates a total of 100 basis points in 2023, which resulted in an increase in interest income, on an FTE basis, of 11.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, the Corporation's loan portfolio is 67.6 percent variable and repricing occurred when the Federal Open Market Committee's ("FOMC") increased interest rates a total of 100 basis points in 2023. The FOMC decreased interest rates 50 basis points in the the third quarter of 2024. As a result, yields on new and renewed loans were 7.70 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.88 percent for the same period in 2023. The Corporation also recognized fair value accretion income on purchased loans, which is included in interest income, of 1.4 million, which accounted for 4 basis points of net interest margin in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Comparatively, the Corporation recognized 2.0 million of accretion income for the three months ended September 30, 2023, or 5 basis points of net interest margin. 
 
 As customers have migrated to higher yielding interest-bearing deposit products, interest expense on deposits increased 13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or 37 basis points when compared to the same period in 2023. Total cost of funds was 3.28 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.92 percent during the same period in 2023. Interest costs increased 36 basis points, which mitigated the 27 basis point increase in asset yields and resulted in a 9 basis point FTE decrease in net interest spread when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, FTE asset yields increased 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in interest income, on an FTE basis, of 55.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to FOMC's increase in interest rates in 2023. The Corporation also recognized fair value accretion income on purchased loans, which is included in interest income, of 4.3 million, which accounted for 3 basis points of net interest margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Comparatively, the Corporation recognized 6.4 million of accretion income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, or 5 basis points of net interest margin. 
 
 Interest expense on deposits increased 86.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 80 basis points when compared to the same period in 2023. Total cost of funds was 3.24 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.49 percent during the same period in 2023. Interest costs increased 75 basis points, which mitigated the 40 basis point increase in asset yields and resulted in a 35 basis point FTE decrease in net interest spread when compared to the same period in 2023.

NONINTEREST INCOME 
 
 Noninterest income totaled 24.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 3.0 million, or 10.7 percent, decrease compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by 9.1 million in losses on sales of available for sale securities associated with repositioning of the bond portfolio. The decrease of noninterest income was partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in gains and fees on sales of loans, a 1.1 million increase in fiduciary and wealth management fees and a 1.0 million increase in gains on cash surrender value of life insurance. 
 
 During the nine months September 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled 82.8 million, a 3.7 million, or 4.6 percent, increase when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 3.6 million increase in net gains and fees on sales of loans, a 2.9 million increase in fiduciary and wealth management fees and a 1.3 million increase in service charge on deposit accounts, when compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were partially offset by an increase of 4.6 million in net losses realized on sales of available for sale securities from 4.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 9.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE 
 
 Noninterest expense totaled 94.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.8 million, or 0.8 percent, increase from the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 1.3 million in equipment expenses primarily related to an increase in software expenses and a 0.7 million increase in FDIC assessments. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of 0.8 million in professional and other outside services expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled 283.0 million, a 2.8 million, or 1.0 percent, increase when compared to the same period in 2023. FDIC assessments increased 4.2 million, primarily due to a 1.1 million special assessment recorded in 2024, coupled with a one-time credit of 2.0 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, outside data processing expenses and equipment expenses both increased 1.8 million, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the Corporation's continued investment in customer-facing digital solutions. Partially offsetting the increase in noninterest expenses were decreases in salary and employee benefit expenses of expense of 1.1 million and 0.9 million, respectively. Additionally, professional and outside services decreased 1.4 million and intangible asset amortization decreased 1.1 million. 

INCOME TAXES 
 
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.2 million on pre-tax net income of 56.3 million. For the same period in 2023, income tax expense was 9.0 million on pre-tax income of 65.4 million. The effective income tax rates for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 12.7 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively. 
 
 Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.1 million on pre-tax net income of 155.1 million. For the same period in 2023, income tax expense was 31.0 million on pre-tax net income of 212.3 million. The effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 11.6 percent and 14.6 percent, respectively. 
 
 The lower effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily a result of tax-exempt interest income being a larger portion of pre-tax income in 2024.

CAPITAL 
 
 Preferred Stock 
 As part of the Level One acquisition, the Corporation issued 10,000 shares of newly created 7.5 percent non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of 2,500 per share, in exchange for the outstanding Level One Series B preferred stock, and as part of that exchange, each outstanding Level One depository share representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Level One preferred stock was converted into a depository share of the Corporation representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its newly issued preferred stock. The Corporation had 25.0 million of outstanding preferred stock at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation declared and paid dividends of 46.88 per share (equivalent to 0.4688 per depository share) and 140.64 per share, respectively, equal to 468,000 and 1,406,000, respectively. The Series A preferred stock qualifies as tier 1 capital for purposes of the regulatory capital calculations.

Stock Repurchase Program 
 On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved a stock repurchase program of up to 3,333,000 shares of the Corporation's outstanding common stock; provided, however, that the total aggregate investment in shares repurchased under the program may not exceed 100,000,000. On a share basis, the amount of common stock subject to the repurchase program represented approximately 6 percent of the Corporation's outstanding shares at the time the program became effective . The Corporation did not repurchase any shares of its common stock pursuant to the repurchase program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Corporation repurchas ed 1.5 million shares of its common stock pursuant to the repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had approximately 1.2 million shares at an aggregate value of 24.6 million available to repurchase under the program. 
 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "IRA") was enacted. Among other things, the IRA imposes a new 1 percent excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after December 31, 2022 by publicly traded U.S. corporations (like the Corporation). With certain exceptions, the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year, including shares issued pursuant to compensatory arrangements. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded a 25,000 reduction in excise tax as shares issued in the quarter resulted in a reduction of the excise tax recorded in prior periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded excise tax of 457,000 related to its share repurchases, net of share issuances, during the period, which is reflected in the Statement of Stockholders' Equity as a component of additional paid-in capital. 
 
 Regulatory Capital 
 Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. The Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies and are assigned to a capital category. The assigned capital category is largely determined by four ratios that are calculated according to the regulations: total risk-based capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity tier 1 ("CET1"), and tier 1 leverage ratios. The ratios are intended to measure capital relative to assets and credit risk associated with those assets and off-balance sheet exposures of the entity. The capital category assigned to an entity can also be affected by qualitative judgments made by regulatory agencies about the risk inherent in the entity's activities that are not part of the calculated ratios. 
 
 There are five capital categories defined in the regulations, ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized. Classification of a bank in any of the undercapitalized categories can result in actions by regulators that could have a material effect on a bank's operations. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total risk-based capital, tier 1 capital, and common equity tier 1 capital, in each case, to risk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets, or leverage ratio, all of which are calculated as defined in the regulations. Banks with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, depending on their actual levels. The appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade a bank to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the bank is in an unsafe or unsound practice. Banks are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category. 
 
 Basel III requires the Corporation and the Bank to maintain the minimum capital and leverage ratios as defined in the regulation and as illustrated in the table below, which capital to risk-weighted asset ratios include a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. Under Basel III, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends, the Corporation must hold a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized CET1 to risk-weighted assets ratio (which buffer is reflected in the required ratios below). Under Basel III, the Corporation and Bank elected to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to be considered well capitalized under the fully phased-in Basel III capital rules. There is no threshold for well capitalized status for bank holding companies. 
 
 As part of a March 27, 2020 joint statement of federal banking regulators, an interim final rule that allowed banking organizations to mitigate the effects of the CECL accounting standard on their regulatory capital was announced. Banking organizations could elect to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital effects of CECL for up to two years. This two-year delay was to be in addition to the three-year transition period that federal banking regulators had already made available. While the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 provided for a further extension of the mandatory adoption of CECL until January 1, 2022, the federal banking regulators elected to not provide a similar extension to the two year mitigation period applicable to regulatory capital effects. Instead, the federal banking regulators require that, in order to utilize the additional two-year delay, banking organizations must have adopted the CECL standard no later than December 31, 2020, as required by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economice Security Act, or CARES Act. As a result, because implementation of the CECL standard was delayed by the Corporation until January 1, 2021, it began phasing in the cumulative effect of the adoption on its regulatory capital, at a rate of 25 percent per year, over a three-year transition period that began on January 1, 2021. Under that phase-in schedule, the cumulative effect of the adoption is fully reflected in regulatory capital on January 1, 2024.

On November 1, 2013, the Corporation completed the private issuance and sale to four institutional investors of an aggregate of 70.0 million of debt comprised of (a) 5.00 percent Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2028 in the aggregate principal amount of 5 million and (b) 6.75 percent Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due October 30, 2028 in the aggregate principal amount of 65.0 million. As of December 31, 2023 the Corporation began the five year phase-out (at a rate of 20 percent per year) as defined in the Basel III capital rules, which resulted in a reduction of 13.0 million in tier 2 capital. The Corporation exercised its right to redeem 40 million of the subordinated debt on the scheduled interest payment date during the first quarter of 2024 and redeemed the remaining 25.0 million during the second quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation's remaining subordinated debentures of 78.2 million were classified as tier 2 capital and were not subject to the five year phase-out. 
 
 Management believes the disclosed capital ratios are meaningful measurements for evaluating the safety and soundness of the Corporation. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. The Federal Reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as CET1. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common stockholders equity (essentially tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock and non-controlling interest in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on CET1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. Tier I regulatory capital consists primarily of total common stockholders equity and subordinated debentures issued to business trusts categorized as qualifying borrowings, less non-qualifying intangible assets and unrealized net securities gains or losses.

In management's view, certain non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures and ratios in assessing our operating results, related trends and when forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures and ratios presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The Corporation's tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that are meaningful to the Corporation, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Corporation's use of equity and in facilitating period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. Tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.76 percent at September 30, 2024, and 8.40 percent at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had net unrealized losses associated with its investment securities available for sale of 189.2 million and 219.7 million, respectively. The unrealized losses are due to interest rate changes and not due to credit quality. 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures such as tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible earnings per share, return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible equity are important measures of the strength of the Corporation's capital and ability to generate earnings on tangible common equity invested by our shareholders. These non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information and may assist investors in analyzing the Corporation s financial position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock, but retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive losses in shareholder's equity. Disclosure of these measures also allows analysts and banking regulators to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. 
 
 The tables within the NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reconcile traditional GAAP measures to these non-GAAP financial measures at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

LOAN QUALITY AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS 
 
 The Corporation s primary lending focus is small business and middle market commercial, commercial real estate, public finance and residential real estate, which results in portfolio diversification. Commercial loans are individually underwritten and judgmentally risk rated. They are periodically monitored and prompt corrective actions are taken on deteriorating loans. Consumer loans are typically underwritten with statistical decision-making tools and are managed throughout their life cycle on a portfolio basis. 
 
 Loan Maturities 
 
 The following tables present the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, by collateral classification at September 30, 2024 according to contractual maturities of (1) one year or less, (2) after one year but within five years and (3) after five years. The tables also present the portion of loans by loan classification that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Loan Quality 
 
 The quality of the loan portfolio and the amount of nonperforming loans may increase or decrease as a result of acquisitions, organic portfolio growth, problem loan recognition and resolution through collections, sales or charge-offs. The performance of any loan can be affected by external factors such as economic conditions, or internal factors specific to a particular borrower, such as the actions of a customer's internal management. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, non-accrual loans totaled 59.1 million, an increase of 5.5 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a 11.4 million increase in non-accrual balances in commercial real estate, non-owner occupied. The increase was offset by a decline in non-accrual balances within the residential loan portfolio of 6.2 million. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, loans 90-days or more delinquent and still accruing totaled 14.1 million, an increase of 13.9 million from December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by one relationship totaling 13.0 million that was renewed subsequent to September 30, 2024 and is current. 
 
 According to applicable accounting guidance, loans that no longer exhibit similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually to determine if there is a need for a specific reserve. Commercial loans under 500,000 and consumer loans are not individually evaluated. The determination for individual evaluation is made based on current information or events that may suggest it is probable that not all amounts due of principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, will be substantially collected. 
 
 The Corporation's nonperforming assets plus accruing loans 90-days or more delinquent and individually evaluated loans are presented in the table below. 
 (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Nonperforming Assets: Non-accrual loans 59,088 53,580 OREO and Repossessions 5,247 4,831 Nonperforming assets (NPA) 64,335 58,411 Loans 90-days or more delinquent and still accruing 14,105 172 NPAs and loans 90-days or more delinquent 78,440 58,583 

The composition of nonperforming assets plus accruing loans 90-days or more delinquent is reflected in the following table by loan class. 
 (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Nonperforming assets and loans 90-days or more delinquent: Commercial and industrial loans 9,542 9,136 Agricultural land, production and other loans to farmers 81 58 Real estate loans: Construction 520 Commercial real estate, non-owner occupied 40,992 16,652 Commercial real estate, owner occupied 3,237 3,041 Residential 19,598 25,178 Home equity 4,945 3,945 Individuals' loans for household and other personal expenditures 45 19 Public finance and other commercial loans 34 Nonperforming assets and loans 90-days or more delinquent: 78,440 58,583 

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 
 The CECL model requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost based on historical experiences, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. CECL also requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's portfolio. Additional details of the Corporation's CECL methodology and allowance calculation are discussed within NOTE 4. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 The CECL allowance is maintained through the provision for credit losses, which is a charge against earnings. Based on management s judgment as to the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, the amount provided in any period may be greater or less than net loan losses for the same period. The determination of the provision amount and the adequacy of the allowance in any period is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio.

PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The Corporation s loan balances, excluding loans held for sale, increased 160.8 million from December 31, 2023 to 12.6 billion at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the ACL -loans totaled 187.8 million, which represents a decrease of 17.1 million from December 31, 2023. As a percentage of loans, the ACL - loans was 1.48 percent and 1.64 percent at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net charge-offs totaling 6.7 million and 48.6 million were recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and provision for credit losses of 5.0 million and 31.5 million, respectively, were recorded for the same periods in 2024. Net charge-offs totaling 20.4 million and 22.5 million were recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, with 2.0 million in provision for credit losses recorded in the same periods in 2023. The increase in net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily related to two commercial and industrial relationships that accounted for 41.6 million of charge-offs. One borrower experienced a sudden change in revenue from the cancellation and inability to renegotiate their contracts with the U.S. Government. This negatively impacted the value of the borrower's business and resulted in their inability to repay principal and interest. The second borrower provided notification of its plans to cease operations. The Corporation does not believe these charge-offs are indicative of the portfolio as a whole. 
 
 The distribution of the net charge-offs (recoveries) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are reflected in the following table. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in Thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net charge-offs (recoveries): Commercial and industrial loans 5,870 19,654 46,794 19,937 Real estate loans: Commercial real estate, non-owner occupied 192 (44) Commercial real estate, owner occupied (18) (73) (8) Residential 600 (14) 1,095 67 Home equity (222) 437 (346) 1,749 Individuals' loans for household and other personal expenditures 479 288 944 794 Total net charge-offs (recoveries) 6,709 20,365 48,606 22,495 

Management continually evaluates the commercial loan portfolio by including consideration of specific borrower cash flow analysis and estimated collateral values, types and amounts on nonperforming loans, past and anticipated credit loss experience, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, and the current condition and amount of loans outstanding. The determination of the provision for credit losses in any period is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio, and its judgment as to the impact of current economic conditions on the portfolio. The Corporation continues to monitor economic forecast changes, loan growth and credit quality to determine provision needs in the future. 

LIQUIDITY 
 
 Liquidity management is the process by which the Corporation ensures that adequate liquid funds are available for the holding company and its subsidiaries. These funds are necessary in order to meet financial commitments on a timely basis. These commitments include withdrawals by depositors, funding credit obligations to borrowers, paying dividends to stockholders, paying operating expenses, funding capital expenditures, and maintaining deposit reserve requirements. Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the asset/liability committee. 
 
 The Corporation s liquidity is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is subject to certain regulatory limitations and access to other funding sources. Liquidity of the Bank is derived primarily from core deposit growth, principal payments received on loans, the sale and maturity of investment securities, net cash provided by operating activities, and access to other funding sources. 
 
 The principal source of asset-funded liquidity is investment securities classified as available for sale, the market values of which totaled 1.6 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 73.6 million, or 4.5 percent, from December 31, 2023. Securities classified as held to maturity that are maturing within a short period of time can also be a source of liquidity. Securities classified as held to maturity and that are maturing in one year or less totaled 15.1 million at September 30, 2024. In addition, other types of assets such as cash and interest-bearing deposits with other banks, federal funds sold and loans maturing within one year are sources of liquidity. 
 
 The most stable source of liability-funded liquidity for both the long-term and short-term is deposit growth and retention in the core deposit base. Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are also considered a source of liquidity. In addition, FHLB advances and Federal Reserve Discount Window borrowings are utilized as a funding source. At September 30, 2024, total borrowings from the FHLB were 832.6 million and there were no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The Bank has pledged certain mortgage loans and investments to the FHLB and Federal Reserve. The total available remaining borrowing capacity from the FHLB and Federal Reserve at September 30, 2024 was 762.6 million and 1.1 billion, respectively.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table presents the Corporation's material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations at September 30, 2024: 
 
 Payments Due In (Dollars in Thousands) One Year or Less Over One Year Total Deposits without stated maturity 11,980,746 11,980,746 Certificates and other time deposits 2,108,640 275,714 2,384,354 Securities sold under repurchase agreements 124,894 124,894 Federal Home Loan Bank advances 105,000 727,629 832,629 Federal Funds Purchased 30,000 30,000 Subordinated debentures and other borrowings 1,335 92,227 93,562 Total 14,350,615 1,095,570 15,446,185 

Also, in the normal course of business, the Bank is a party to a number of other off-balance sheet activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in our consolidated financial statements. These activities primarily consist of traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments such as loan commitments and standby letters of credit. 
 
 Summarized credit-related financial instruments at September 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 Amounts of commitments: Loan commitments to extend credit 5,493,144 Standby and commercial letters of credit 66,043 5,559,187 

Since many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used, the total amount of unused commitments in the preceding table does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 

INTEREST SENSITIVITY AND DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Asset/Liability management has been an important factor in the Corporation's ability to record consistent earnings growth through periods of interest rate volatility and product deregulation. Management and the Board of Directors monitor the Corporation's liquidity and interest sensitivity positions at regular meetings to review how changes in interest rates may affect earnings. Decisions regarding investment and the pricing of loan and deposit products are made after analysis of reports designed to measure liquidity, rate sensitivity, the Corporation s exposure to changes in net interest income given various rate scenarios and the economic and competitive environments. 
 
 It is the objective of the Corporation to monitor and manage risk exposure to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. It is the goal of the Corporation s Asset/Liability management function to provide optimum and stable net interest income. To accomplish this, management uses two asset liability tools. GAP/Interest Rate Sensitivity Reports and Net Interest Income Simulation Modeling are constructed, presented and monitored quarterly. Management believes that the Corporation's liquidity and interest sensitivity position at September 30, 2024, remained adequate to meet the Corporation s primary goal of achieving optimum interest margins while avoiding undue interest rate risk. 
 
 Net interest income simulation modeling, or earnings-at-risk, measures the sensitivity of net interest income to various interest rate movements. The Corporation's asset liability process monitors simulated net interest income under three separate interest rate scenarios; base, rising and falling. Estimated net interest income for each scenario is calculated over a twelve-month horizon. The immediate and parallel changes to the base case scenario used in the model are presented below. The interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view of future market movements. Rather, these are intended to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may introduce into the earnings of the Corporation. 
 58 

PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The base scenario is highly dependent on numerous assumptions embedded in the model, including assumptions related to future interest rates. While the base sensitivity analysis incorporates management's best estimate of interest rate and balance sheet dynamics under various market rate movements, the actual behavior and resulting earnings impact will likely differ from that projected. For certain assets, the base simulation model captures the expected prepayment behavior under changing interest rate environments. Assumptions and methodologies regarding the interest rate or balance behavior of indeterminate maturity products, such as savings, money market, interest-bearing and demand deposits, reflect management's best estimate of expected future behavior. Historical retention rate assumptions are applied to non-maturity deposits for modeling purposes. 
 
 The comparative rising 200 and 100 basis points and falling 200 and 100 basis points scenarios below, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, assume further interest rate changes in addition to the base simulation discussed above. These changes are immediate and parallel changes to the base case scenario. 
 
 Results for the rising 200 and 100 basis points and falling 200 and 100 basis points interest rate scenarios are listed below based upon the Corporation s rate sensitive assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The change from the base scenario represents cumulative net interest income over a twelve-month time horizon. Balance sheet assumptions used for the base scenario are the same for the rising and falling simulations. 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Rising 200 basis points from base case 4.4 4.0 Rising 100 basis points from base case 3.3 2.1 Falling 100 basis points from base case (1.7) (5.0) Falling 200 basis points from base case (3.5) (7.8)
