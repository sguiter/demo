While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can
be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

The following management s
discussion and analysis MD A should be read in conjunction with financial statements of ConneXionONE
Corp. formerly Alternative Fuel Technologies, Inc. (the Company for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, and the notes thereto.

Corp . formerly Alternative Fuel Technologies, Inc. (the Company or its management. These forward-looking statements

Overview 

ConneXionONE Corp. formerly Alternative Fuel Technologies,
Inc. is a development stage company. Our business plan includes acquisitions of operating companies. The focus of the Company s
business involves developing and operating a decentralized social media platform. Our business plan incorporates decentralized concept
of social media platforms which may, at some point, provide viable alternatives to established platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook
and TikTok. 

Our user-driven algorithm
tool is designed to empower users to regain control of their social media experience. By customizing their own feeds based on their preferences
and interests, users can avoid irrelevant or unwanted content and focus on what matters to them. This feature also enables users to interact
with each other in a way that enhances their overall experience on the platform, creating a more personalized and engaging social network. 

Our social media platform
also incorporates AI-powered content creation assistance feature by analyzing the user's input and providing suggestions to improve the
quality and relevance of the content. When a user is creating a post, the AI algorithm will analyze the text and make suggestions for
better word choices, grammar corrections, and even provide topic suggestions to improve engagement. The user can then choose to accept
or reject these suggestions, making it a customizable and personalized experience. This feature aims to help users create better content
more efficiently and effectively, ultimately enhancing their experience on the platform. 

Our social media platform
values user participation, as we believe that users are the core reason why social media platforms exist; we have implemented a unique
reward system that allows users to earn rewards by engaging and interacting with the content on our platform. Whether it's liking a post,
leaving a comment, or sharing a video, every action taken by the user is rewarded that can be exchanged for various perks and benefits.
This incentivizes users to be more active on the platform and create a vibrant and engaging community. By putting the power back into
the hands of the users, we hope to create a more user-friendly and democratic social media experience that is enjoyable for everyone involved. 

Moreover, our creator's
marketplace feature allows users to monetize their own unique content by licensing it to local businesses or brands for advertising and
marketing purposes. This provides an opportunity for content creators to earn income from their work and also ensures that advertisers
have access to high-quality, relevant content. 

15 

We feel that our business
plan addresses the need for additional development in the decentralized social media industry. 

User-driven algorithm
is a tool for users to gain control of the social networking platform. Our decentralized social media DSM platform is
a sharing/consortium platform that will benefit Users, Creators, Advertisers, and Content Providers. 

DSM Platform comprises
of 4 major components, Content Aggregator, Mobile Advertising Mediation, User-driven algorithm, and creator s marketplace: 

Content Aggregator: analyzes
the content type and formats (text/picture and video) sorts and distributes appropriate content to users app based on
user preferences categorizes, matches, and tags content with suitable/appropriate advertisements. 

Mobile Advertising Mediation:
accepts mobile ads from businesses, product/service providers, ad agencies, etc. categorizes, matches, and associates the received
ads with the most relevant and appropriate contents Distributes ads with associated content to users mobile app. 

User-driven algorithm:
provides users with the ability to customize their own feeds based on their preferences and interests, allows users to interact with each
other in a way that enhances their overall experience on the platform. 

Creator's marketplace: allows users to license
their own unique content to local businesses or brands for advertising and marketing purposes. 

The analysis will be
undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into definitive agreements.
In our continued efforts to analyze potential business plan, we intend to consider the following factors: 

Potential for growth, indicated by anticipated market expansion or new technology; 

Competitive position as compared to other DSM platforms of similar size and experience within the social media within the industry as a whole 

Strength and diversity of management, and the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, services, professional assistance, and other required items 

Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities or convertible debt, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources 

The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced in the marketplace; and 

Other relevant factors 

In applying the foregoing
criteria, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative
measures and available data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse
facts about the opportunity to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial,
technical, and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing our business plan. 

We are unable to predict
when we will, if ever, identify and implement our business plan. We anticipate that proposed business plan would be made available to
us through personal contacts of our directors, officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists,
members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder s
fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate. 

16 

A s
of this filing, we have not raised any capital and our business is under development stage, and the Company is
focused on raising capital for its business plans. We have engaged developers and started the development of our first mobile app for
the decentralized social media platform of the Company. 

On July 29, 2022, the
Company s board and shareholders have approved the following actions by amending the Company s Amended Articles of Incorporation
to effect: (1) a corporate name changed from Alternative Fuel Technologies, Inc. to ConneXionONE Corp.; and (2) a one-for-one thousand
(1:1,000) reverse stock split of the Company s class of common stock with all other aspects to remain unchanged. Both the Reverse
Stock Split and the Name Change were effective on April 17, 2023. 

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every
1,000 shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of Common Stock,
without any change in the par value per share. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional
shares that would otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the next whole number. The Reverse Stock Split
reduced the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding from approximately 71,850,033,691 shares to approximately 71,850,644 shares,
subject to further adjustment for the rounding up of fractional shares. 

Following the Name Change, any stock certificates
that reflect the former name of the Company will continue to be valid. Certificates reflecting the Name Change will be issued in due course
as old stock certificates are tendered for exchange or transfer to the Company s transfer agent. 

The Common Stock began trading on a reverse stock
split-adjusted basis on the OTC Market on April 17, 2023. The trading symbol for the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split and
the Name Change is CNNN. The new symbol will be changed to AFTCD at first; and after 20 business days, the
symbol will change to CNNN . The new CUSIP number for the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change
is 208211102. 

On June 1, 2022, the
Company has entered into a Software Development and Operation Service Agreement with a developer to develop and maintain its social media
platform application. The Company has recognized payments of 647,000 to the developer as of September 30, 2024. The Company is a development
stage company pursuing an actual business in accordance to the business plans where it has entered into development agreement with a developer
and incurred material expenditures for the development of the platform. The Company launched the first beta version of its app in November
2022, and will have a full featured app with business model launching in the coming quarter.

Critical Accounting
Policies 

Our discussion and analysis
of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those
related to provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventories, valuation of intangible assets and contingencies and litigation.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The accounting policies
that we follow are set forth in Note 2 to our financial statements as included in the SEC report filed. These accounting policies conform
to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial
statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting
company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information in this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and
Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures. 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the
SEC s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As disclosed
in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective at December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The limitation of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting was due to the applied risk-based approach which is indicative of many small companies with limited number
of staff in corporate functions. The identified weaknesses were: 

Material Weakness We did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we (i) lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements and (ii) we lacked controls over the disclosure of our business operations. 

Lack of segregation of duties Significant Deficiencies Inadequate segregation of duties. 

We expect to be materially
dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future which we believe will mitigate
the impact of the material weaknesses discussed above. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise
in U.S. GAAP and establish an audit committee and implement internal controls and procedures, there are no assurances that the material
weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures will not result in errors in our financial statements
which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. 

Changes in Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting. 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
