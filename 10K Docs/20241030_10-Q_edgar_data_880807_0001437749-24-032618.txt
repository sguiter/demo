million. In addition, the Company has historically experienced recurring negative operating cash flows. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of million. Cash provided by operations for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was million. 
 
 In January 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S- 3 that will expire three years from the date on which it was declared effective, March 15, 2027 the First Form S- 3 ). The First Form S- 3 allows the Company to offer and sell from time-to-time up to million of common stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities, with million available for future offerings as of September 30, 2024 . The First Form S- 3 is intended to provide the Company flexibility to conduct registered sales of its securities, subject to market conditions, in order to fund its future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the First Form S- 3 will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering. 
 
 On January 31, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Oppenheimer Co. Inc., as a representative of the several underwriters named therein, relating to the issuance and sale (the "2024 Offering") of shares of the Company's common stock at a public offering price of per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the 2024 Offering were approximately million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. The 2024 Offering closed on February 14, 2024. 
 
 On August 1, 2024 (the "Acquisition Date"), the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement with the selling stockholders named therein. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Megatran Industries, Inc. ("Megatran") (the "Acquisition"), for aggregate consideration in an amount equal to million (the Purchase Price ), which consideration amount was subject to various adjustments set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (including those described below) and consisted of: (a) (i) million, minus (ii) the Indebtedness (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing, minus (iii) Company Expenses (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) (collectively, the Cash Purchase Price (b) a number of restricted shares (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share, as applicable) (the Company Shares of the Company s common stock, . par value per share Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing x million (the Share Purchase Price by (y) the closing price per share of Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date; and (c) an additional cash payment equal to million, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 5.6 (c), (d), and (f) of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the Additional Cash Purchase Price ). Megatran is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates, is operated and reported as a component of its Grid business unit. On September 23, 2024, the Company paid million to the selling stockholders, which was calculated based on the agreed upon formula set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. This amount is reflected as the change in fair value of this contingent consideration in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there are no remaining obligations to the selling stockholders of Megatran. 
 
 In August 2024, the Company filed an automatically-effective shelf registration statement on Form S- 3 that will expire no later than August 12, 2027 the Second Form S- 3 ). The Second Form S- 3 allows the Company to offer and sell from time-to-time unspecified amounts of common stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities and allows certain selling stockholders to offer and sell from time-to-time common stock. The Second Form S- 3 is intended to assist the selling stockholders in the resale of their common stock and to provide the Company flexibility to conduct registered sales of its securities, subject to market conditions, in order to fund its future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the Second Form S- 3 will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering. 
 
 In recent periods, the Company has experienced inflationary pressure in its supply chain and some delays in sourcing materials needed for its products resulting in some production disruption, both of which have increased the Company s cost of revenues and decreased gross margin. While the impact of inflation has been challenging, the Company has taken actions to limit this pressure, including adjusting the pricing of its products and services. Changes in macroeconomic conditions arising from various reasons, such as the ongoing wars between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, inflation, rising interest rates, labor force availability, sourcing, material delays and global supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The Company believes that based on the information presented above and its quarterly management assessment, it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months following the issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2024 . The Company s liquidity is highly dependent on its ability to increase revenues, its ability to control its operating costs, and its ability to raise additional capital, if necessary. The impact of global sources of instability, including the wars between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, on the global financing markets may reduce the Company's ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, which could negatively impact the Company's liquidity. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise additional capital, on favorable terms or at all, from other sources or execute on any other means of improving liquidity described above. 

million, which consideration amount was subject to various adjustments set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (including those described below) and consisted of: (a) (i) million, minus (ii) the Indebtedness (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing, minus (iii) Company Expenses (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement); (b) a number of restricted shares (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share, as applicable) of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing x million by (y) the closing price per share of Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date; and (c) an additional cash payment equal to million, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 5.6 (c), (d), and (f) of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Megatran is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates, is operated and reported as a component of its Grid business unit. On September 23, 2024, the Company paid million to the selling stockholders, which was calculated based on the agreed upon formula set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. This amount is reflected as the change in fair value of this contingent consideration in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there are remaining obligations to the selling stockholders of Megatran. 
 
 The Acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations . The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. 
 
 The total purchase price of approximately million includes the fair value of shares of the Company s common stock issued at closing, and cash paid, as follows (in millions): 

Issuance of 1,297,600 shares of Company s Common Stock 

At the Acquisition Date, in addition to the million cash, the Company valued the Company s common stock, using per share, which was the closing price on the day prior to the day that the Company acquired Megatran. Acquisition costs of million and million were included in s elling, general and administrative ("SG A") for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and related deferred income taxes in connection with the Acquisition (in millions): 

Equity-method investments 
 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 
 Accounts receivable 
 Inventory 
 Property, plant, and equipment 
 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 
 Deferred revenue 
 Deferred tax liability 
 Net tangible assets/(liabilities) 
 
 Backlog 
 Customer relationships 
 Net identifiable intangible assets 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Total purchase consideration 

The fair value of the financial assets acquired includes receivables with a fair value of million. The gross amount due is million, of which million is expected to be uncollectible. 
 
 Inventory includes a million adjustment to step up the inventory balance to fair value consistent with the purchase price allocation. The fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling cost and a normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. The inventory step up adjustment increased cost of revenue million in the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as the inventory was sold. 
 
 Backlog of million was evaluated using the multi period excess earnings method under the income approach. The contracts with customers do not provide for any guarantees to source all future requirements from the Company. The amortization method being utilized is economic consumption estimated over an eight -month period with the expense being allocated to cost of revenues. 
 
 Customer relationships of million relates to customers currently under contract and was determined based on a multi period excess earnings method under the income approach. The method of amortization being utilized is straight line over years, as the results were not materially different from the economic consumption method, with the expense being allocated to SG A. 
 
 Goodwill represents the value associated with the acquired workforce and expected synergies related to the business combination of the two companies. Goodwill resulting from the Acquisition was assigned to the Company s Grid segment. Goodwill recognized in the Acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. This purchase price allocation is preliminary and has not been finalized as the analysis on the assets and liabilities acquired, primarily the tax related liability may require further adjustments to our purchase accounting that could result in a measurement period adjustment that would impact the Company's reported net assets and goodwill as of August 1, 2024. Material changes, if any, to the preliminary allocation summarized above will be reported once the related uncertainties are resolved, but no later than August 1, 2025. The million of deferred tax liability is primarily related to basis difference of property, plant, and equipment. 
 
 Unaudited Pro Forma Operating Results 

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 presented as if the Acquisition had occurred on April 1, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is as follows: 

Operating income (loss) 
 Net income (loss) 
 
 Net income (loss) per common share 
 Basic 
 Diluted 
 Shares - basic 
 Shares - diluted 

The pro forma amounts include the historical operating results of the Company and Megatran with appropriate adjustments that give effect to acquisition related costs, income taxes, intangible amortization resulting from the Acquisition and certain conforming accounting policies of the Company. The pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if the Acquisition and related transactions had been completed at the beginning of the applicable periods presented. In addition, the pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of operating results in future periods. 
 
 In the unaudited consolidated results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, Megatran s operations are included in the Company s consolidated results from the date of Acquisition of August 1, 2024. Megatran contributed million of revenue and million in net income for the Company for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2024. Amortization expense of million is included in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the Megatran acquired intangible assets. In addition, million for the step-up basis assigned to acquired inventory was charged to cost of revenues in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. 

and of revenue, respectively, was recognized at the point in time when control transferred to the customer, with the remainder being recognized over time. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , and of revenue, respectively, was recognized at the point in time when control transferred to the customer, with the remainder being recognized over time. 
 
 In the Company's equipment and system product line, each contract with a customer summarizes each product sold to a customer, which typically represents distinct performance obligations. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price which is determined primarily using the cost-plus expected margin approach and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of the Company s product sales transfer control to the customer in line with the contracted delivery terms and revenue is recorded at the point in time when title and risk transfer to the customer, which is primarily upon delivery, as the Company has determined that this is the point in time that control transfers to the customer. 
 
 In the Company's service and technology development product line, there are several different types of transactions and each begins with a contract with a customer that summarizes each product sold to a customer, which typically represents distinct performance obligations. The technology development transactions are primarily for activities that have no alternative use and for which a profit can be expected throughout the life of the contract. In these cases, the revenue is recognized over time, but in the instances where the profit cannot be assured throughout the entire contract then the revenue is recognized at a point in time. Each contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price which is determined primarily using the cost-plus expected margin approach. The ongoing service transactions are for service contracts that provide benefit to the customer simultaneously as the Company performs its obligations, and therefore this revenue is recognized ratably over time throughout the effective period of these contracts. The transaction prices on these contracts are allocated based on an adjusted market approach which is re-assessed annually for reasonableness. The field service transactions include contracts for delivery of goods and completion of services made at the customer's requests, which are not deemed satisfied until the work has been completed and/or the requested goods have been delivered, so all of this revenue is recognized at the point in time when the control changes, and at allocated prices based on the adjusted market approach driven by standard price lists. The royalty transactions are related to certain contract terms on transactions in the Company's equipment and systems product line based on activity as specified in the contracts. The transaction prices of these agreements are calculated based on an adjusted market approach as specified in the contract. The Company reports royalty revenue for usage-based royalties when the sales have occurred. In circumstances when collectability is not assured and a contract does not exist under ASC 606, revenue is deferred until a non-refundable payment has been received for substantially all the amount that is due and there are no further remaining performance obligations. 

The Company's service contracts can include a purchase order from a customer for specific goods in which each item is a distinct performance obligation satisfied at a point in time at which control of the goods is transferred to the customer. This transfer occurs based on the contracted delivery terms or when the requested service work has been completed. The transaction price for these goods is allocated based on the adjusted market approach considering similar transactions under similar circumstances. Service contracts are also derived from ongoing maintenance contracts and extended service-type warranty contracts. In these transactions, the Company is contracted to provide an ongoing service over a specified period of time. As the customer is consuming the benefits as the service is being provided, the revenue is recognized over time ratably. 
 
 The Company s policy is not to accept volume discounts, product returns, or rebates and allowances within its contracts. In the event a contract was approved with any of these terms, it would be evaluated for variable consideration, estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related product revenue was recorded. 
 
 The Company provides assurance-type warranties on all product sales for a term of typically one to three years, and extended service-type warranties are available for purchase at the customer's option for an additional term ranging up to four additional years. The Company accrues for the estimated warranty costs for assurance warranties at the time of sale based on historical warranty experience plus any known or expected changes in warranty exposure. For all extended service-type warranties, the Company recognizes the revenue ratably over time during the effective period of the services. 
 
 The Company records revenue net of sales tax, value added tax, excise tax and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities. The Company has elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over the products sold passes to customers and revenue is recognized. The Company has elected to recognize incremental costs of obtaining a contract as expense when incurred except in contracts where the amortization period would exceed twelve months. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 , the Company's capitalized incremental contract costs were not material. The Company has elected not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the period of financing is twelve months or less.

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company s contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the timing differences between cash received from a customer in connection with contractual rights to invoicing and the timing of revenue recognition following completion of performance obligations. The Company's accounts receivable balance is made up entirely of customer contract related balances. Changes in the Company s contract assets, which are included in Unbilled accounts receivable and Deferred program costs (see Note 8, Accounts Receivable and Note 9, Inventory for a reconciliation to the condensed consolidated balance sheets) and "Contract liabilities", which are included in the current portion and long-term portion of "Deferred revenue" in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets, are as follows (in thousands):

There are also approximately m illion o f outstanding performance obligations to be recognized over a period of thirteen to sixty months. The remaining performance obligations are subject to customer actions and therefore the timing of revenue recognition cannot be reasonably estimated.

million related to payroll taxes paid in the first and second quarters of 2021 and the first quarter of 2020. The Company determined it met all the criteria required under the gross receipts test of the applicable Internal Revenue Service regulations related to ERCs. 
 
 As accounting for payroll tax credits are not within the scope of ASC 740, Income Taxes , the Company has chosen to account for the ERCs by analogizing to the International Accounting Standards Board IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance .

ownership in NWL Pacific Inc. Co., LTD ("NWL Pacific"). The investment represents the Company's interest in NWL Pacific. The investment is a joint venture in South Korea established on May 12, 1998. 
 
 The Company treats the equity investment in the condensed consolidated financial statements under the equity method. Equity method investments are equity securities in entities the Company does not control but over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus the Company s share of an investee s income or loss, less distributions received. As of September 30, 2024 the Company did not have material accounts receivable nor accounts payable balances with NWL Pacific.

million and million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and income tax expense of million and million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 As a result of a difference in book and tax basis related to the intangible assets acquired in the Acquisition (see Note 2, "Acquisition"), the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of million. As a result, the Company was able to benefit from additional deferred tax assets and therefore released a corresponding valuation allowance of million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and has not been finalized as the analysis on the assets and liabilities acquired, primarily the tax related liability, may require further adjustments to the Company's purchase accounting that could result in measurement period adjustments that would impact the Company's reported net assets and goodwill as of August 1, 2024 . Material changes, if any, to the preliminary allocation summarized in Note 2, "Acquisition" will be reported once the related uncertainties are resolved, but no later than August 1, 2025 . Goodwill recognized in the Acquisition, is not deductible for tax purposes. 
 
 Accounting for income taxes requires a two -step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company re-evaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. The evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The Company did not identify any uncertain tax positions in the six months ended September 30, 2024 and did not have any gross unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 . 

million in cash and restricted shares of common stock of the Company. As part of the transaction, the selling stockholders were entitled to receive up to an additional shares of common stock of the Company upon the achievement of certain specified revenue objectives during varying periods of up to four years following closing of the NEPSI Acquisition. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued shares of common stock and cash in lieu of a fractional share of common stock, related to the achievement of specified revenue objectives in connection with the NEPSI Acquisition. NEPSI recognized revenues in excess of million during the four years after the NEPSI Acquisition Date. As a result, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued shares of common stock of the Company to the selling stockholders, following certification of the achievement of the specified earnout revenue objective. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has settled all outstanding contingent consideration under the NEPSI Stock Purchase Agreement. 
 
 The Company evaluated the NEPSI Acquisition earnout payment set forth in the NEPSI Stock Purchase Agreement, which was expected to require settlement in the Company's common stock, and determined the contingent consideration qualified for liability classification and derivative treatment under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . As a result, for each period, the fair value of the contingent consideration was remeasured and the resulting gain or loss was recognized in operating expenses until the share amount is fixed. 
 
 Megatran Contingent Consideration 
 
 On August 1, 2024 , the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the selling stockholders of Megatran named therein. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Megatran for aggregate consideration in an amount equal to million which consideration amount was subject to various adjustments set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. The value of the contingent consideration to make the sellers whole was determined to be de minimus at the time of the Acquisition. On September 23, 2024, the Company paid million to the selling stockholders, which was calculated based on the agreed upon formula set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. This amount is reflected as the change in fair value of this contingent consideration in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there are remaining obligations to the selling stockholders of Megatran. In the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 the Company completed the payment of million to selling stockholders of Megatran to settle the remaining obligations of the acquisition.

Finance Leases 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the right-of-use asset related to the finance lease is fully amortized, and is included in the property and equipment, net on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Finance lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized similar to an operating lease, at the lease commencement date or the date the lessor makes the leased asset available for use. Finance lease right-of-use assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and the carrying amount of the finance lease liabilities are 1 accreted to reflect interest using the incremental borrowing rate if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, and 2 reduced to reflect lease payments made during the period. Amortization expense for finance lease right-of-use assets and interest accretion on finance lease liabilities are recorded to depreciation expense and interest expense, respectively in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations.

The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. The Company s business segments have been determined in accordance with the Company s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measures are segment revenues and segment operating loss. The disaggregated financial results of the segments reflect allocation of certain functional expense categories consistent with the basis and manner in which Company management internally disaggregates financial information for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions. In addition, certain corporate expenses which the Company does not believe are specifically attributable or allocable to either of the two business segments have been excluded from the segment operating loss. 
 
 Unallocated corporate expenses consisted of net losses resulting from activity relating to both the NEPSI earnout and the Megatran make whole payment which resulted in million and million in increases in the fair value of contingent consideration in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. Unallocated corporate expenses consisted of a loss on contingent consideration of million and million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. Additionally, unallocated corporate expenses consisted of stock-based compensation expense of million and million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively .

We continue to experience some inflationary pressure in our supply chain and some delays in sourcing materials needed for our products, resulting in some production disruption, both of which have increased our cost of revenues and decreased gross margin. While the impact of inflation has been challenging, we continue to take actions to limit this pressure including adjusting the pricing of our products and services. Changes in macroeconomic conditions arising from various reasons, such as the ongoing wars between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, inflation, rising interest rates, labor force availability, sourcing, material delays and global supply chain disruptions, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In February 2023, we completed the process of determining and verifying our eligibility and amount of payroll tax credits known as the Employee Retention Credit ERC under the CARES Act which Congress enacted as part of the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020. This resulted in filing certain amended payroll tax forms for eligible quarters in 2020 and 2021, which, in the aggregate, totaled 3.3 million. We recognized a receivable in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a benefit to cost of revenues and operating expenses in the quarter ended March 31, 2023. In the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received 3.0 million in payments for the initial claims that were processed. The remaining balance is expected to be paid during fiscal 2024. 
 
 On February 2, 2024, we completed an offering of 6,210,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 11.25 per share under our then-existing Registration Statement on Form S-3. We received net proceeds of approximately 65.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. See Note 1, Nature of the Business and Operations and Liquidity, for further information about this offering. 
 
 On August 1, 2024, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement with the selling stockholders named therein. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Megatran, for aggregate consideration in an amount equal to 61.4 million, as may be adjusted pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Price ), including a cash payment after closing of 5.0 million, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 5.6(c), (d), and (f) of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the Additional Cash Purchase Price ). At closing, we paid to Megatran's selling stockholders 25.0 million in cash on hand, and 1,297,600 restricted shares of our common stock. On September 23, 2024, the Company paid the Additional Cash Purchase Price to the selling stockholders, which was calculated based on the agreed upon formula set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, in the amount of 8.3 million. Megatran's wholly-owned subsidiary, NWL, Inc. ("NWL"), is a U.S.-based global provider of engineered power conversion solutions for demanding industrial and military applications. As a result of this transaction, Megatran became a wholly-owned subsidiary and is operated by our Grid business unit. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Equity Method Investments 
 
 We treat the equity investment in the condensed consolidated financial statements under the equity method. Equity method investments are equity securities in entities we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus the Company s share of an investee s income or loss, less distributions received. Other than those noted here, there were no significant changes in the critical accounting policies that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.

Our Grid business unit accounted for 86 and 84 of total revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 84 for each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. Our Grid business unit revenues increased 65 to 46.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 28.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our Grid business unit revenues increased 46 to 79.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, from 54.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the Grid business unit revenues in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Megatran and increased shipments of new energy power systems than in the prior year periods. 

29

Our Wind business unit accounted for 14 and 16 of total revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 16 for each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues in the Wind business unit increased 37 and 55 to 7.5 million and 15.5 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 5.5 million and 10.0 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by additional shipments of electrical control systems ("ECS") at increased prices. 
 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin 
 
 Cost of revenues increased by 53 to 38.9 millio n for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 25.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues increased by 35 to 66.9 millio n for the six months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 49.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 29 and 29 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 25 and 23 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Cost of revenues includes total amortization expense of 0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the Megatran acquired backlog intangible assets. In addition, a fair value purchase adjustment of approximately 0.7 million for the step-up basis assigned to acquired inventory, to properly reflect the fair value in purchase accounting. Of this adjustment, 0.3 million was charged to cost of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024, when the inventory sold. The increase in gross margin in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher revenues, a favorable product mix and favorable impacts across the business due to pricing increases across our product lines. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Research and development 
 
 Research and development ("R D") expenses increased 61 and 41 in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, to 2.6 million and 4.9 million from 1.6 million and 3.5 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by higher overall compensation expense and additional supplies and materials. 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased 32 and 23 in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, to 10.5 million and 19.4 million from 7.9 million and 15.8 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in SG A expense in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, was due to higher overall compensation expense and higher acquisition costs. 
 
 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
 
 We recorded amortization expense related to our core technology and know-how, customer relationships, and other intangible assets of 0.4 million and 0.8 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and 0.5 million and 1.1 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in amortization expense is a result of using the economic consumption method as the basis to amortize the acquired customer relationship intangible assets from Northeast Power Systems, Inc. ("NEPSI") and Neeltran. 
 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration 
 
 The change in fair value of our contingent consideration for the earnout payment on the acquisition of NEPSI resulted in a gain of 0.5 million from a decrease in fair value and a loss of 3.4 million resulting from an increase in fair value in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 300,000 shares of common stock of the Company to the selling stockholders following certification of the achievement of specified earnout revenue objectives. We recorded the above noted changes, compared to losses of 0.9 million and 2.2 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We also recorded a 3.3 million payment relating to the Megatran acquisition, as a payment to settle the remaining obligations after the acquisition. The value of this contingent consideration was de minimus at the Acquisition Date and the resulting change in fair value was recorded during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024

Ou r Grid business segment generated operating income of 2.3 million and 3.2 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to operating losses of 0.7 million and 2.6 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. The increase in the Grid business unit operating income in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher revenues and gross margins in part due to a favorable product mix . 
 
 Our Wind business segment generated operating income of 0.5 million and 1.5 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to operating income of 0.3 million and operating loss of 0.4 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. The improvement in the Wind business unit operating income in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher revenues and gross margins from increased sales of ECS units. 
 
 Unallocated corporate expenses included net losses on contingent consideration of 2.8 million and 6.7 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and net losses of 0.9 million and 2.2 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Additionally, unallocated corporate expenses consisted of stock-based compensation expense of 0.8 million and 2.1 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.1 million and 2.5 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Interest income, net 

Interest income, net, was 1.0 million and 2.1 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.2 million and 0.4 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. The increase in interest income, net, in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher cash balances. 
 
 Other expense, net 
 
 Other expense, net, was 0.3 million and 0.5 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to 0.2 million and 0.3 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. The increase in other expense, net, during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by the impacts of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currencies during the periods. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax benefit was 5.0 million and 4.8 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. Income tax expense was 0.1 million and 0.2 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. The improvement in income tax benefit was a result of the release of the valuation allowance due to the recording of the deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Megatran. 

31

Net income (loss) 
 
 Net income was 4.9 million and 2.4 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to net losses of 2.5 million and 7.9 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The improvement in net loss was driven primarily by deferred tax liability recorded as a result of the Megatran acquisition as well as increased revenues and gross margins. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) 
 
 Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income (loss) before stock-based compensation, acquisition costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and other non-cash or unusual charges. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) assists management and investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding these non-cash charges and other items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use non-GAAP net income (loss) as a factor to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) is set forth in the table below (in thousands, except per share data):

We incurred non-GAAP net income of 10.0 million and 13.2 million, or 0.27 and 0.36 per share, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to a non-GAAP net income of less than 0.1 million and a non-GAAP net loss of 2.1 million, or 0.00 and 0.07 per share, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. The improvement in the non-GAAP net income (loss) for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was due to a lower operating loss driven by higher revenues and gross margins. In the three months ended June 30, 2024, we excluded acquisition costs from the r econciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) as there was no definitive agreement with respect to the acquisition of Megatran as of June 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have experienced recurring operating losses and, as of September 30, 2024 , had an accumulated deficit of 1,064.3 millio n. 
 
 Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including the successful completion of our product development activities, our ability to commercialize our Resilient Electric Grid and ship protection system solutions, the rate of customer and market adoption of our products, collecting receivables according to established terms, the continued availability of U.S. government funding during the product development phase of our superconductor-based products and whether Inox is successful in executing on Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited orders or in obtaining additional orders under the new central and state auction regime. We continue to closely monitor our expenses and, if required, expect to reduce our operating and capital spending to enhance liquidity. 
 
 In January 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that will expire three years from the date on which it was declared effective, March 15, 2027 (the First Form S-3 ). The First Form S-3 allows us to offer and sell from time-to-time up to 250 million of common stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities. The First Form S-3 is intended to provide us flexibility to conduct registered sales of our securities, subject to market conditions, in order to fund our future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the First Form S-3 will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering. 
 
 On February 14, 2024, we completed a public offering of 6,210,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 11.25 per share under our then-existing Registration Statement on Form S-3. We received net proceeds of approximately 65.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 
 As described above, on August 1, 2024, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Megatran, for aggregate consideration in an amount equal to 61.4 million (the Purchase Price ), which consideration amount was subject to various adjustments set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (including those described below) and consisted of: (a) (i) 25.0 million, minus (ii) the Indebtedness (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing, minus (iii) Company Expenses (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) (collectively, the Cash Purchase Price (b) a number of restricted shares (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share, as applicable) (the Company Shares of our common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) 31.4 million by (y) the closing price per share of Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding August 1, 2024; and (c) an additional cash payment equal to 5.0 million, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 5.6(c), (d), and (f) of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Megatran is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates, is operated and reported as a component of its Grid business unit. On September 23, 2024, the Company paid the Additional Cash Purchase Price to the selling stockholders, which was calculated based on the agreed upon formula, in the amount of 8.3 million. 
 
 In August 2024, we filed an automatically-effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that will expire no later than August 12, 2027 (the Second Form S-3 ). The Second Form S-3 allows us to offer and sell from time-to-time common stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities and allows certain selling stockholders to offer and sell from time-to-time common stock. The Second Form S-3 is intended to assist the selling stockholders in the resale of their common stock and to provide us flexibility to conduct registered sales of its securities, subject to market conditions, in order to fund our future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the Second Form S-3 will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 74.8 million, compared to 92.3 million as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of 17.5 million. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 3.9 m illion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in foreign bank accounts. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are summarized as follows (in thousands):

For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 16.1 million, compared to cash used in operations of 1.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in the six months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to increased net income, increased deferred revenue, decrease in cash spent on accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decrease in inventory purchases, and change in fair value of contingent consideration, offset by cash spent on prepaid expenses, deferred income taxes, decreased accounts receivable, and a decrease in operating leases. 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 33.5 million, compared to 0.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash paid for the acquisition of Megatran. 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 0.1 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 0.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to the repurchase of common stock in connection with employee tax obligations upon the vesting of stock awards, offset by proceeds related to ESPP. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.5 million of restricted cash included in long-term assets and 1.2 million of restricted cash included in current assets. At March 31, 2024, we had 1.3 million of restricted cash included in long-term assets and 0.5 million of restricted cash in current assets. These amounts included in restricted cash primarily represent collateral deposits to secure surety bonds and letters of credit for various customer contracts. These deposits are held in interest bearing accounts. 
 
 We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, while others are considered future commitments. We have various contractual arrangements, under which we have committed to purchase certain minimum quantities of goods or services on an annual basis. For information regarding our other contractual obligations, refer to Note 15, "Contingent Consideration," Note 16, "Debt," Note 17, "Leases" and Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies" to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

33

We believe we have sufficient available liquidity to fund our operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months. We recently raised 65.2 million, net of offering expenses, through an equity raise in February 2024. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of loans, convertible debt or equity, to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures. Our liquidity is highly dependent on our ability to increase revenues, control our operating costs, and raise additional capital, if necessary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all or execute on any other means of improving our liquidity as described above. Additionally, the impact of global sources of instability, including the ongoing wars between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, instability of financial institutions and political instability in the United States, on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, which could negatively impact our liquidity. We also continue to closely monitor our expenses and, if required, we intend to reduce our operating and capital spending to enhance liquidity. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. We record a liability in our condensed consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We review these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjust the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, we estimate and disclose the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary to make the condensed consolidated financial statements not misleading. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 . The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
