 Goodwill, Intangible, and Long-Lived Tangible Assets 
 Some assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances.

Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.

 The accumulated benefit obligation is equal to the projected benefit obligation as of August 31, 2024 because the plan is frozen. The Company does not expect to make any contributions to the pension plan during fiscal 2024 as the plan s funding exceeds the minimum funding requirements. 
 The actuarial gain for the period ended August 31, 2024 was attributable to increased discount rates and the removal of participants electing to receive a single-sum payment from the pension plan.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are the largest branded marketer of young children s apparel in North America. We own two of the most highly recognized and trusted brand names in the children s apparel market, Carter s and OshKosh B gosh (or OshKosh ). We also own Skip Hop , a leading young children s lifestyle brand, Little Planet , a brand focused on organic fabrics and sustainable materials, and exclusive Carter s brands developed for Amazon, Target, and Walmart. 
 Established in 1865, our Carter s brand is recognized and trusted by consumers for high-quality apparel and accessories for children in sizes newborn to 14. 
 Established in 1895, OshKosh is a well-known brand, trusted by consumers for high-quality apparel and accessories for children in sizes newborn to 14, with a focus on playclothes for toddlers and young children. We acquired OshKosh in 2005. 
 Established in 2003, the Skip Hop brand rethinks, reenergizes, and reimagines durable necessities to create higher value, superior quality, and top-performing products for parents, babies, and toddlers. We acquired Skip Hop in 2017. 
 Launched in 2021, the Little Planet brand focuses on sustainable clothing through the sourcing of mostly organic cotton as certified under the Global Organic Textile Standard GOTS ), a global textile processing standard for organic fibers. This brand includes a wide assortment of baby and toddler apparel, accessories, and sleepwear. 
 Additionally, Child of Mine , an exclusive Carter s brand, is sold at Walmart; Just One You , an exclusive Carter s brand, is sold at Target, and Simple Joys , an exclusive Carter s brand, is available on Amazon. 
 Our mission is to serve the needs of families with young children, with a vision to be the world s favorite brands in young children s apparel and related products. We believe our brands are complementary to one another in product offering and aesthetic. Each brand is uniquely positioned in the marketplace and offers great value to families with young children. Our multichannel, global business model, which includes retail stores, eCommerce, and wholesale distribution capabilities, as well as omni-channel capabilities in the United States and Canada, enables us to reach a broad range of consumers around the world. As of September 28, 2024, our channels included 1,039 company-owned retail stores in North America, eCommerce websites, approximately 19,350 wholesale locations in North America, as well as our international wholesale accounts and licensees who operate in over 1,100 locations outside of North America in over 90 countries. 
 The following is a discussion of our results of operations and current financial condition. This should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-Q and audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2023 fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. 
 Segments 
 Our three business segments are: U.S. Retail, U.S. Wholesale, and International. These segments are our operating and reporting segments. Our U.S. Retail segment consists of revenue primarily from sales of products in the United States through our retail stores and eCommerce websites. Similarly, our U.S. Wholesale segment consists of revenue primarily from sales in the United States of products to our wholesale partners. Our International segment consists of revenue primarily from sales of products outside the United States, largely through our retail stores and eCommerce websites in Canada and Mexico, and sales to our international wholesale customers and licensees.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit is calculated as consolidated net sales less cost of goods sold. Gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by consolidated net sales. Cost of goods sold includes expenses related to the merchandising, design, and procurement of product, including inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, and inspection costs. Also included in costs of goods sold are the costs of shipping eCommerce product to end consumers. Retail store occupancy costs, distribution expenses, and generally all other expenses other than interest and income taxes are included in Selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses. Distribution expenses that are included in SG A primarily consist of payments to third-party shippers and handling costs to process product through our distribution facilities, including eCommerce fulfillment costs, and delivery to our wholesale customers and to our retail stores. Our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to other entities that define their metrics differently. 
 
 Known or Anticipated Trends 
 Macroeconomic Factors and Consumer Demand 
 Macroeconomic factors, including persistent inflationary pressures on families with young children, increased interest rates, increased consumer debt levels, decreased savings rates, and geopolitical unrest continue to create a complex and challenging retail environment. These macroeconomic factors have had and may continue to have a negative impact on consumer sentiment and consumer demand for our products. In part due to these macroeconomic factors, our business has experienced a shift in consumer demand from the retail channel to the mass channel. As consumers face financial pressures, U.S. Wholesale has benefited from consumers choosing the ease of one-stop shopping available through the mass channel. Additionally, we have observed increased promotional activity across the retail industry, which may negatively impact our financial results, including revenue and operating margins in the future. 
 We have taken actions to mitigate the impact of decreased consumer demand, including strengthening our product offerings through a focus on style and value, increasing our mix of premium price offerings, including through our Little Planet brand and our PurelySoft collection, optimizing our fleet of retail stores, improving our marketing effectiveness to drive traffic, including through the relaunch of our loyalty program in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and investing in our exclusive wholesale brands, our international omnichannel capabilities, and the talent in our organization. 
 Additionally, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced a planned investment of 50.0 million in the second half of fiscal 2024 to strengthen the value proposition of our direct-to-consumer product offerings and to improve customer acquisition, customer retention, and brand awareness. This consists of an investment of 40.0 million to lower prices on select products to be more competitive and to increase clearance velocity on prior season goods and an investment of 10.0 million in brand marketing. We believe these investments, along with better in-store and online shopping experiences, led to improvement in U.S. Retail conversion rates, transactions, unit volume, and new customer acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. We currently expect to spend a total of 60.0 million on these investments in the second half of fiscal 2024, with the incremental 10.0 million directed towards our investment in pricing. 
 Supply Chain 
 The disruption of container shipping traffic through the Red Sea has affected transit times and shipping costs for our inventory from our Asia manufacturers beginning in fiscal 2024. The adverse impact of the disruptions in the region, including additional transportation fees to re-route these shipments, were approximately 1.0 million and 6.0 million in the third quarter and the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively. We believe these issues could result in additional costs of approximately 0.5 million to 1.0 million for the remainder of fiscal 2024. However, if these hostilities continue or escalate, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Additionally, as a result of capacity shortages with some of our carriers in Asia, we incurred approximately 4.0 million in additional transportation costs driven by surcharges on shipments and increased market spot rates associated with the use of non-contractual carriers in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. We are estimating an additional 2.0 million to 3.0 million of such transportation costs through the end of fiscal 2024. 
 Despite these additional costs, we expect our freight input costs for fiscal 2024 to be favorable to those incurred in fiscal 2023.

 Third Fiscal Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights 
 Unless otherwise stated, comparisons are to the third quarter of fiscal 2023: 
 Consolidated net sales decreased 33.2 million, or 4.2 , to 758.5 million, driven by lower U.S. Retail sales. 
 Traffic and demand in our U.S. Retail businesses decreased, in part due to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds negatively impacting families with young children including inflationary pressures, increased interest rates, increased consumer debt levels, decreased savings rates, and geopolitical unrest. However, U.S. Retail saw improvement in demand around Labor Day, which we believe reflects the positive impact of our investment in pricing and brand marketing. U.S. Retail comparable net sales decreased 7.1 . The effects of macroeconomic headwinds may continue to negatively impact our financial results in the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 We continue to experience growth in our exclusive Carter s brands and in our Little Planet brand. We believe we will see continued growth with our exclusive Carter s brands in the future due to consumer demand trends in the mass channel. We have meaningful growth planned for the Little Planet brand as we expand product assortment and distribution. While we saw sales growth in retail stores in Mexico, this growth was largely offset by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Consolidated gross profit decreased 20.4 million, or 5.4 , to 356.0 million. Consolidated gross margin decreased 60 bps to 46.9 , reflecting in part our investments in our pricing strategies. 
 Consolidated operating income decreased 16.4 million, or 17.5 , to 77.0 million driven by decreased net sales. Operating margin decreased 160 bps to 10.2 driven by fixed cost deleverage on decreased net sales and investments in our retail stores. 
 Consolidated net income decreased 7.8 million, or 11.8 , to 58.3 million due to the factors discussed above and a non-cash partial pension settlement charge of 0.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in our income tax provision of 6.8 million, an increase in interest income of 1.3 million, and a decrease in interest expense of 1.2 million. 
 Diluted net income per common share decreased 0.16, or 9.0 , to 1.62, and adjusted diluted net income per common share decreased 0.20, or 10.9 , to 1.64. 
 Inventories decreased 13.3 million, or 2.1 , to 607.4 million, due to decreased pack and hold inventory and decreased days of supply. 
 We have continued to invest in the optimization of our fleet of U.S. Retail stores, including through opening new retail stores, developing new store formats, and remodeling existing store locations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we opened 11 stores and closed 5 stores in the United States. We are projecting approximately 14 store openings and 6 store closures in the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 As a result of our strong financial position and available liquidity, we returned 45.6 million to our shareholders, comprised of 28.8 million in cash dividends and 16.7 million in share repurchases in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, we returned 137.9 million to our shareholders, comprised of 87.3 million in cash dividends and 50.5 million in share repurchases.

 Note: Results may not be additive due to rounding. Percentage changes that are not considered meaningful are denoted with nm . 
 Consolidated Net Sales 
 Consolidated net sales decreased 33.2 million, or 4.2 , to 758.5 million. This decrease in net sales was driven by decreased traffic and demand in our U.S. Retail businesses, decreased average selling prices per unit, decreased sales of our Carter s brand to wholesale customers, decreased demand in Canada, and changes in the timing of wholesale shipments to our international partners. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our exclusive Carter s brands in the U.S. and increased sales in retail stores in Mexico. Units sold increased in the low-single digits driven by U.S. Wholesale. Average selling prices per unit decreased mid-single digits due to our investments in our pricing strategies previously mentioned. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation had an unfavorable effect on our consolidated net sales of approximately 3.1 million. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Consolidated gross profit decreased 20.4 million, or 5.4 , to 356.0 million and consolidated gross margin decreased 60 bps to 46.9 . The decrease in consolidated gross profit was primarily driven by decreased net sales. The decrease in gross margin was driven by a benefit in excess inventory provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 that did not reoccur in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, decreased average selling prices per unit mentioned above, and an increase in the mix of U.S. Wholesale net sales, including sales of our exclusive Carter s brands, which have a lower contribution to gross margin than our U.S. Retail segment. These factors were partially offset by lower average cost per unit sold and decreased sales to off-price wholesale channel customers. Average cost per unit sold decreased mid-single digits, driven by lower product input costs, partially offset by increased freight surcharges and costs to re-route our product around the Red Sea. We expect to experience decreased product input costs for the remainder of fiscal 2024.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 Consolidated SG A expenses decreased 4.0 million, or 1.4 , to 284.7 million and increased as a percentage of consolidated net sales by approximately 100 bps to 37.5 . This increase in SG A rate was driven by fixed cost deleverage on decreased sales, investments in our brand marketing and retail stores, increased distribution costs, and increased transportation costs, partially offset by decreased performance-based compensation expense and decreased consulting costs. 
 Operating Income 
 Consolidated operating income decreased 16.4 million, or 17.5 , to 77.0 million and decreased as a percentage of net sales by approximately 160 bps to 10.2 , primarily due to the factors discussed above. 
 Interest Expense 
 Consolidated interest expense decreased 1.2 million, or 14.3 , to 7.4 million. Weighted-average borrowings for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 500.0 million at an effective interest rate of 6.12 , compared to weighted-average borrowings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of 535.0 million at an effective interest rate of 6.13 . The decrease in weighted-average borrowings was attributable to decreased borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility. 
 Interest Income 
 Consolidated interest income increased 1.3 million to 2.4 million due to increased cash balances during the period. 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 Consolidated other expense (income), net increased 0.8 million to 1.3 million primarily due to a non-cash partial pension settlement charge of 0.9 million. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our consolidated income tax provision decreased 6.8 million, or 35.5 , to 12.4 million and the effective tax rate decreased 500 bps to 17.5 . The decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to a favorable resolution of prior period tax items, as well as due to the mix of earnings in our revised full year outlook. This outlook reflects an expectation for a lower proportion of income generated in the United States than the prior year, which is a higher tax rate relative to some of our international jurisdictions. 
 Net Income 
 Our consolidated net income decreased 7.8 million, or 11.8 , to 58.3 million, primarily due to the factors previously discussed.

 Results by Segment - Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 compared to Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023 
 The following table summarizes net sales and operating income, by segment, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of fiscal 2023: 
 Fiscal quarter ended (dollars in thousands) September 28, 2024 of consolidated net sales September 30, 2023 of consolidated net sales Change Change Net sales: U.S. Retail 352,987 46.5 374,796 47.3 (21,809) (5.8) U.S. Wholesale 298,980 39.5 300,338 38.0 (1,358) (0.5) International 106,497 14.0 116,517 14.7 (10,020) (8.6) Consolidated net sales 758,464 100.0 791,651 100.0 (33,187) (4.2) Operating income: of segment net sales of segment net sales U.S. Retail 27,309 7.7 47,983 12.8 (20,674) (43.1) U.S. Wholesale 63,127 21.1 65,702 21.9 (2,575) (3.9) International 10,237 9.6 13,379 11.5 (3,142) (23.5) Unallocated corporate expenses (23,633) n/a (33,634) n/a 10,001 (29.7) Consolidated operating income 77,040 10.2 93,430 11.8 (16,390) (17.5) 
 Comparable Sales Metrics 
 We present comparable sales metrics because we consider them an important supplemental measure of our U.S. Retail and International performance, and the Company uses such information to assess the performance of the U.S. Retail and International segments. Additionally, we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our business. 
 Our comparable sales metrics include sales for all stores and eCommerce sites that were open and operated by us during the comparable fiscal period, including stand-alone format stores that converted to multi-branded format stores and certain remodeled or relocated stores. A store or site becomes comparable following 13 consecutive full fiscal months of operations. If a store relocates within the same center with no business interruption or material change in square footage, the sales of such store will continue to be included in the comparable store metrics. If a store relocates to another center more than five miles away, or there is a material change in square footage, such store is treated as a new store. Stores that are closed during the relevant fiscal period are included in the comparable store sales metrics up to the last full fiscal month of operations. 
 The method of calculating sales metrics varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales metrics may not be comparable to those of other retailers. 
 U.S. Retail 
 U.S. Retail segment net sales decreased 21.8 million, or 5.8 , to 353.0 million. The decrease in net sales was driven by lower traffic and demand in our retail stores and in our eCommerce channels, in part due to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds negatively impacting families with young children and decreased average selling prices per unit. These factors were partially offset by sales contribution of our new retail stores. Additionally, U.S. Retail saw improvement in demand around Labor Day, which we believe reflects the positive impact of our investments in pricing and brand marketing. Average selling prices per unit decreased mid-single digits and units sold were consistent with the third quarter of fiscal 2023, driven by our investments in our pricing strategies previously mentioned. 
 Comparable net sales, including retail store and eCommerce, decreased 7.1 , showing an improvement over the first two quarters of fiscal 2024, when comparable net sales decreased 9.2 . As of September 28, 2024, we operated 795 retail stores in the U.S. compared to 792 as of December 30, 2023, and 768 as of September 30, 2023. 
 U.S. Retail segment operating income decreased 20.7 million, or 43.1 , to 27.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of 15.3 million and an increase in SG A expenses of 5.7 million. Operating margin decreased 510 bps to 7.7 . The primary drivers of the decrease in operating margin were a 60 bps decrease in gross margin and a 460 bps increase in SG A 
 21

 rate. The decrease in gross margin was driven by a benefit in excess inventory provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 that did not reoccur in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and decreased average selling prices per unit mentioned above, partially offset by decreased average cost per unit sold. Average cost per unit sold decreased mid-single digits due lower product input costs, partially offset by increased inbound freight costs. The increase in SG A rate was driven by fixed cost deleverage on decreased net sales, investments in our brand marketing and retail stores, increased retail store employee compensation costs, and increased transportation costs, partially offset by decreased performance-based compensation expense. 
 U.S. Wholesale 
 U.S. Wholesale segment net sales decreased 1.4 million, or 0.5 , to 299.0 million, driven by lower seasonal demand for our Carter s brands, decreased sales to off-price wholesale channel customers as a result of our lower excess inventory levels, unfavorable timing of wholesale shipments, and decreased average selling prices per unit, partially offset by growth in our exclusive Carter s brands and our Little Planet brand. Units sold increased low-single digits, while average selling prices per unit decreased low-single digits. 
 U.S. Wholesale segment operating income decreased 2.6 million, or 3.9 , to 63.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of 1.7 million and an increase in SG A expenses of 0.6 million. Operating margin decreased 80 bps to 21.1 . The primary drivers of the decrease in operating margin were a 40 bps decrease in gross margin and a 30 bps increase in SG A rate. The decrease in gross margin was driven by decreased average selling prices per unit mentioned above and a benefit in excess inventory provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 that did not reoccur in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by decreased average cost per unit sold and decreased off-price wholesale channel sales. Average cost per unit sold decreased mid-single digits due to decreased product input costs partially offset by increased inbound freight costs. The increase in the SG A rate was driven by fixed cost deleverage on decreased sales, increased distribution costs, and investments in brand marketing, partially offset by decreased performance-based compensation expense. 
 International 
 International segment net sales decreased 10.0 million, or 8.6 , to 106.5 million. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican Peso, had a 3.1 million unfavorable effect on International segment net sales. The decrease in net sales was driven by decreased net sales in Canada, decreased demand from our international partners, and decreased average selling prices per unit, partially offset by growth in sales in our retail stores in Mexico. Units sold and average selling prices per unit both decreased mid-single digits. 
 Canadian comparable net sales, including retail stores and eCommerce, decreased 6.8 , driven by decreased traffic in our retail stores and eCommerce channels as a result of macroeconomic headwinds and a slower start to cooler weather apparel sales. As of September 28, 2024, we operated 188 stores and 56 stores in Canada and Mexico, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, we operated 188 and 54 stores in Canada and Mexico, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, we operated 188 and 53 stores in Canada and Mexico, respectively. 
 International segment operating income decreased 3.1 million, or 23.5 , to 10.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of 3.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG A expenses of 0.3 million. Operating margin decreased 190 bps to 9.6 , primarily due to a 310 bps increase in the SG A rate, partially offset by a 120 bps increase in gross margin. The increase in gross margin was due to decreased average cost per unit sold, partially offset by decreased average selling prices per unit mentioned above. Average cost per unit sold decreased high-single digits due to decreased product input costs. The increase in the SG A rate was driven by fixed cost deleverage on decreased sales and increased bad debt expense, partially offset by decreased performance-based compensation expense. 
 Unallocated Corporate Expenses 
 Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate overhead expenses that are not directly attributable to one of our business segments and include unallocated accounting, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology expenses, occupancy costs for our corporate headquarters, and other benefit and compensation programs, including performance-based compensation. 
 Unallocated corporate expenses decreased 10.0 million, or 29.7 , to 23.6 million and unallocated corporate expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, decreased 110 bps to 3.1 . The decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales was driven by decreased performance-based compensation expense, organizational restructuring costs, and consulting costs, partially offset by fixed cost deleverage on decreased sales and increased charitable donations.

 Consolidated Net Sales 
 Consolidated net sales decreased 103.3 million, or 4.9 , to 1.98 billion. The decrease in net sales was driven by decreased traffic and demand in our U.S. Retail businesses, decreased sales of our Carter s brand to wholesale customers, decreased sales to off-price wholesale channel customers as a result of our lower excess inventory levels, decreased demand in our International businesses, and decreased average selling prices per unit. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our exclusive Carter s brands and growth from our retail stores in Mexico. Average selling prices per unit decreased mid-single digits and units sold decreased low-single digits. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation had an unfavorable effect on our consolidated net sales of approximately 1.5 million. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Consolidated gross profit decreased 23.6 million, or 2.4 , to 954.1 million and consolidated gross margin increased 130 bps to 48.1 . The decrease in consolidated gross profit was driven by decreased net sales. The increase in gross margin was driven by lower average cost per unit sold and decreased sales to off-price wholesale channel customers. Average cost per unit sold decreased high-single digits, driven by lower ocean freight rates and product input costs. These factors were partially offset by a benefit in excess inventory provisions in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 that did not reoccur in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, decreased average selling prices per unit mentioned above, and an increase in the mix of U.S. Wholesale net sales. 
 Royalty Income 
 Consolidated royalty income decreased 1.6 million, or 9.7 , to 15.0 million, driven by decreased wholesale customer demand.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 Consolidated SG A expenses decreased 9.4 million, or 1.2 , to 797.6 million and increased as a percentage of consolidated net sales by 150 bps to 40.2 . The increase in SG A rate was driven by fixed cost deleverage on decreased sales and investments in our brand marketing and retail stores, partially offset by decreased performance-based compensation expense and decreased consulting costs. 
 Operating Income 
 Consolidated operating income decreased 15.8 million, or 8.4 , to 171.5 million and decreased as a percentage of net sales by approximately 40 bps to 8.6 primarily due to the factors discussed above. 
 Interest Expense 
 Consolidated interest expense decreased 3.2 million, or 12.1 , to 23.2 million. Weighted-average borrowings for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 were 500.0 million at an effective interest rate of 6.13 , compared to weighted-average borrowings for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 of 556.8 million at an effective interest rate of 6.17 . The decrease in weighted-average borrowings was attributable to decreased borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility. 
 Interest Income 
 Consolidated interest income increased 5.9 million to 8.6 million due to increased cash balances during the period. 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 Consolidated other expense (income), net increased 2.5 million to 2.0 million due to a non-cash partial pension settlement charge of 0.9 million and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar and the Mexican Peso. 
 Income Taxes 
 Consolidated income tax provision decreased 7.3 million, or 18.9 , to 31.0 million and the effective tax rate decreased 330 bps to 20.0 . The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to our revised full year outlook, which reflects an expectation for a lower proportion of income generated in the United States that the prior year, where the tax rate is lower relative to some of our international jurisdictions. 
 Net Income 
 Consolidated net income decreased 2.0 million, or 1.6 , to 124.0 million, primarily due to the factors previously discussed.

 Results by Segment - First Three Quarters of Fiscal 2024 compared to First Three Quarters of Fiscal 2023 
 The following table summarizes net sales and operating income, by segment, for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023: 
 Three fiscal quarters ended (dollars in thousands) September 28, 2024 of consolidated net sales September 30, 2023 of consolidated net sales Change Change Net sales: U.S. Retail 950,877 47.9 1,021,983 49.0 (71,106) (7.0) U.S. Wholesale 756,022 38.1 767,194 36.7 (11,172) (1.5) International 277,491 14.0 298,553 14.3 (21,062) (7.1) Consolidated net sales 1,984,390 100.0 2,087,730 100.0 (103,340) (4.9) Operating income: of segment net sales of segment net sales U.S. Retail 59,681 6.3 103,132 10.1 (43,451) (42.1) U.S. Wholesale 162,662 21.5 147,003 19.2 15,659 10.7 International 17,981 6.5 23,193 7.8 (5,212) (22.5) Unallocated corporate expenses (68,796) n/a (85,983) n/a 17,187 (20.0) Consolidated operating income 171,528 8.6 187,345 9.0 (15,817) (8.4) 
 U.S. Retail 
 U.S. Retail segment net sales decreased 71.1 million, or 7.0 , to 950.9 million. The decrease in net sales was driven by lower traffic in our eCommerce channels and in our retail stores, in part due to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds negatively impacting families with young children and decreased average selling prices per unit. These factors were partially offset by sales contribution of our new retail stores. Average selling prices per unit decreased mid-single digits due to investments in our pricing and an increased mix of clearance sales. Units sold decreased mid-single digits. Comparable net sales, including retail store and eCommerce, decreased 8.5 driven by the factors mentioned above. 
 U.S. Retail segment operating income decreased 43.5 million, or 42.1 , to 59.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of 39.6 million and an increase in SG A expenses of 2.7 million. Operating margin decreased 380 bps to 6.3 , primarily due to a 410 bps increase in SG A rate, partially offset by a 40 bps increase in gross margin. The increase in gross margin was due to decreased average cost per unit sold, partially offset by a benefit in excess inventory provisions in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 that did not reoccur in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, and decreased average selling prices per unit mentioned above. Average cost per unit sold decreased mid-single digits due to decreased inbound freight rates and product input costs. The increase in the SG A rate was driven by fixed cost deleverage on decreased net sales, investments in brand marketing and our retail stores, increased retail store employee compensation costs, and increased transportation costs, partially offset by decreased performance-based compensation expense. 
 U.S. Wholesale 
 U.S. Wholesale segment net sales decreased 11.2 million, or 1.5 , to 756.0 million, driven by lower seasonal demand of our Carter s brands, decreased sales to off-price wholesale channel customers as a result of our lower excess inventory levels, and decreased average selling prices per unit. These factors were partially offset by increased sales of our exclusive Carter s brands and our Little Planet brand. Average selling prices per unit decreased mid-single digits due to investments in our pricing, while units sold increased low-single digits. 
 U.S. Wholesale segment operating income increased 15.7 million, or 10.7 , to 162.7 million, primarily due to an increase in gross profit of 15.6 million and a decrease in SG A expenses of 0.1 million. Operating margin increased 230 bps to 21.5 . The drivers of the increase in operating margin were a 250 bps increase in gross margin, partially offset by a 20 bps increase in SG A rate. The increase in gross margin was driven by decreased average cost per unit sold, partially offset by a benefit in excess inventory provisions in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 that did not reoccur in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, and decreased average selling prices per unit mentioned above. Average cost per unit sold decreased high-single digits due to decreased ocean freight rates and product input costs. The increase in the SG A rate was driven by fixed cost 
 25 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 deleverage on decreased sales and increased investments in brand marketing, partially offset by decreased transportation costs and decreased performance-based compensation expense. 
 International 
 International segment net sales decreased 21.1 million, or 7.1 , to 277.5 million. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, had a 1.5 million unfavorable effect on International segment net sales. The decrease in net sales was driven by decreased net sales in Canada, decreased demand from our international partners, and decreased average selling prices per unit. These decreases were partially offset by growth in sales in our retail stores in Mexico. Units sold decreased mid-single digits. Average selling prices per unit decreased low-single digits due to investments in our pricing strategies. 
 Canadian comparable net sales, including retail store and eCommerce, decreased 6.8 driven by decreased traffic in our eCommerce channel and in our retail stores as a result of macroeconomic headwinds. 
 International segment operating income decreased 5.2 million, or 22.5 , to 18.0 million, primarily due to an increase in SG A expenses of 5.1 million, partially offset by an increase in gross profit of 0.4 million. Operating margin decreased 130 bps to 6.5 driven by a 470 bps increase in the SG A rate, partially offset by a 360 bps increase in gross margin. The increase in gross margin was due to decreased average cost per unit sold. Average cost per unit sold decreased high-single digits due to decreased ocean freight rates and product input costs. The increase in the SG A rate was due to fixed cost deleverage on decreased sales, increased bad debt expense, and increased retail store employee compensation costs, partially offset by decreased performance-based compensation expense. 
 Unallocated Corporate Expenses 
 Unallocated corporate expenses decreased 17.2 million, or 20.0 , to 68.8 million and unallocated corporate expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, decreased 60 bps to 3.5 . The decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales was driven by organizational restructuring charges in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 that did not reoccur in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, decreased consulting costs, and decreased performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by fixed cost deleverage on decreased sales. 
 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP MEASURES 
 We have provided non-GAAP adjusted operating income, income taxes, net income, and diluted net income per common share measures, which exclude certain items presented below. We believe that this information provides a meaningful comparison of our results and affords investors a view of what management considers to be our core performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). The most comparable GAAP measures are operating income, income tax provision, net income, and diluted net income per common share, respectively. Adjusted operating income, income taxes, net income, and diluted net income per common share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate adjusted operating income, income taxes, net income, and diluted net income per common share differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our ongoing cash needs are primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, employee compensation, interest on debt, the return of capital to our shareholders, and other general corporate purposes. We expect that our primary sources of liquidity will be cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow from operations, and available borrowing capacity under our secured revolving credit facility. We believe that our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, these sources of liquidity may be affected by events described in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this Form 10-Q, including, but not limited to, our risk factors discussed under the heading Risk Factors in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. 
 As discussed under the heading Known or Anticipated Trends in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, inflationary pressures and declining consumer sentiment have had and may continue to have a negative impact on consumer demand for our products and on our financial results in fiscal 2024. We cannot predict the timing and amount of such impact. 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had approximately 175.5 million of cash and cash equivalents held at major financial institutions, including approximately 72.1 million held at financial institutions located outside of the United States. We maintain cash deposits with major financial institutions that exceed the insurance coverage limits provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States and by similar insurers for deposits located outside the United States. To mitigate this risk, we utilize a policy of allocating cash deposits among major financial institutions that have been evaluated by us and third-party rating agencies as having acceptable risk profiles. 
 Balance Sheet 
 Net accounts receivable at September 28, 2024 were 247.0 million compared to 240.5 million at September 30, 2023 and 183.8 million at December 30, 2023. The overall increase of 6.5 million, or 2.7 , at September 28, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 primarily reflects the timing of wholesale customer shipments and associated payments. Due to the seasonal nature of our operations, the net accounts receivable balance at September 28, 2024 is not comparable to the net accounts receivable balance at December 30, 2023. 
 Inventories at September 28, 2024 were 607.4 million compared to 620.7 million at September 30, 2023 and 537.1 million at December 30, 2023. The decrease of 13.3 million, or 2.1 , at September 28, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 was driven by decreased pack and hold inventory and decreased days of supply, partially offset by increased in-transit inventory due to the disruption of container shipping traffic through the Red Sea. Due to the seasonal nature of our operations, the inventory balance at September 28, 2024 is not comparable to the inventories balance at December 30, 2023. 
 Operating lease assets at September 28, 2024 were 560.2 million compared to 506.0 million at September 30, 2023 and 528.4 million at December 30, 2023. The increase in operating lease assets compared to September 30, 2023 and 
 27 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 December 30, 2023 was driven by the renewal of a contract with a third-party logistics provider in California for warehousing and distribution purposes and investments in our retail store fleet. 
 Accounts payable at September 28, 2024 were 273.9 million compared to 222.2 million at September 30, 2023 and 242.1 million at December 30, 2023. The increase of 51.7 million, or 23.3 , at September 28, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 was driven by the timing of payments for purchases of inventory. Due to the seasonal nature of our operations, the accounts payable balance at September 28, 2024 is not comparable to the accounts payable balance at December 30, 2023. 
 Cash Flow 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 11.3 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 205.8 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven by net income and changes in our working capital. The decrease in operating cash flow was driven by smaller reductions in inventory balances due to the sell through of a large portion of our pack and hold inventory in fiscal 2023. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 39.6 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to 42.5 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was driven by decreased capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 was driven by U.S. and international retail store openings and remodels and investments in our distribution facilities. 
 We plan to invest approximately 65.0 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2024, which primarily relates to U.S. and international retail store openings and remodels, investments in our distribution facilities, and strategic information technology initiatives. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 145.1 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to 206.6 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. This change in cash flow from financing activities was primarily driven by payments on our secured revolving credit facility in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. 
 Secured Revolving Credit Facility 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility, exclusive of 5.7 million of outstanding letters of credit. As of September 28, 2024, there was approximately 844.3 million available for future borrowing. Any outstanding borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility are classified as non-current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets due to contractual repayment terms under the credit facility. However, these repayment terms also allow us to repay some or all of the outstanding borrowings at any time. 
 Our secured revolving credit facility provides for a leverage-based pricing grid which determines an interest rate for borrowings, calculated as the applicable floating benchmark rate plus a credit spread adjustment, if any, plus an amount ranging from 1.125 to 1.625 . As of September 28, 2024, the borrowing rate for an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR loan would have been 6.44 , which includes a leverage-based adjustment of 1.125 . As of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its financial and other covenants under the secured revolving credit facility. 
 Senior Notes 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding 500.0 million principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at a rate of 5.625 per annum, and scheduled to mature on March 15, 2027. On our condensed consolidated balance sheets, the 500.0 million of outstanding senior notes as of September 28, 2024 is reported net of 2.1 million of unamortized issuance-related debt costs. 
 Dividends 
 In each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, the Board of Directors declared, and the Company paid, a cash dividend per common share of 0.80 (for an aggregate cash dividend per common share of 2.40 for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024). Additionally, in each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, the Board of Directors declared, and the Company paid, a cash 
 28 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 dividend per common share of 0.75 (for an aggregate cash dividend per common share of 2.25 for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023). 
 Our Board of Directors will evaluate future dividend declarations based on a number of factors, including restrictions under the Company s secured revolving credit facility, business conditions, the Company s financial performance, and other considerations. 
 Provisions in our secured revolving credit facility could have the effect of restricting our ability to pay cash dividends on, or make future repurchases of, our common stock, as further described in Note 5, Long-term Debt , to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Share Repurchases 
 In the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, we repurchased and retired 736,423 shares in open market transactions for approximately 50.5 million, at an average price of 68.61 per share. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, we repurchased and retired 975,358 shares in open market transactions for approximately 67.5 million, at an average price of 69.20 per share. 
 The total remaining capacity under outstanding repurchase authorizations as of September 28, 2024 was approximately 599.0 million, based on settled repurchase transactions. The share repurchase authorizations have no expiration dates. 
 The Company paused share repurchases during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Future repurchases may occur from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be at the discretion of the Company subject to restrictions under the Company s secured revolving credit facility and considerations given to market conditions, stock price, other investment priorities, and other factors. 
 In light of the share repurchases and dividends paid in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, along with our projected remaining dividend payments this year, we expect the cumulative distribution of capital through share repurchases and dividends to represent somewhat more than 100 of our projected fiscal 2024 free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure the Company defines as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. 
 We do not reconcile forward-looking free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP measure because we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain components of such reconciliation that are not within our control due to factors describe below, or others that may arise, without unreasonable effort. For these reasons, we are unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of future operating cash flows, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to free cash flow. 
 
 Seasonality 
 We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability due to the timing of certain holidays and key retail shopping periods, which generally has resulted in lower sales and gross profit in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half of the fiscal year. Accordingly, our results of operations during the first half of the year may not be indicative of the results we expect for the full year. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described under the heading Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2023 fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments and may result in the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include: revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowance, inventory, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, accrued expenses, loss contingencies, accounting for income taxes, foreign currency, employee benefit plans, and stock-based compensation arrangements. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Currency and Interest Rate Risks 
 In the operation of our business, we have market risk exposures including those related to foreign currency risk and interest rates. These risks, and our strategies to manage our exposure to them, are discussed below. 
 Currency Risk 
 We contract for production with third parties, primarily in Asia. While these contracts are stated in U.S. dollars, there can be no assurance that the cost for the future production of our products will not be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the local currencies of these contractors. Due to the number of currencies involved, we cannot quantify the potential impact that future currency fluctuations may have on our results of operations in future periods. 
 The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 Our foreign subsidiaries typically record sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which are then translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, had an unfavorable effect on our consolidated net sales of approximately 3.1 million. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, as compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, had an unfavorable effect on our consolidated net sales of approximately 1.5 million. 
 Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Transactions by our foreign subsidiaries may be denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses also include the impact of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries that are marked to market. In our condensed consolidated statement of operations, these gains and losses are recorded within Other expense (income), net. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries that are of a long-term nature are accounted for as translation adjustments and are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our secured revolving credit facility, which carries variable interest rates. As of September 28, 2024, there were no variable rate borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility. As a result, the impact of a hypothetical 100 bps increase in the effective interest rate would not result in material interest expense over a 12-month period. 
 Other Risks 
 We enter into various purchase order commitments with our suppliers. We generally can cancel these arrangements, although in some instances we may be subject to a termination charge reflecting a percentage of work performed prior to cancellation. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
