 Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements 

of the Class A common shares, entered into a definitive arrangement agreement
and plan of arrangement to combine the companies in an all-stock transaction (the Arrangement ). Upon completion of the arrangement,
the stockholders of Strong Global Entertainment received 1.5 common shares of the Company for each share of Strong Global Entertainment.
The transaction closed on September 30, 2024. Following the closing, Strong Global Entertainment ceased to exist, and its Common Shares
were delisted from NYSE American LLC (NYSE American and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act ). As the Company was the majority shareholder of Strong Global Entertainment, the financial results of Strong Global Entertainment
are presented on a consolidated basis in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. For periods prior to the Arrangement,
the Company reported the noncontrolling interest in Strong Global Entertainment as a component of equity separate from the Company s
equity. The Company s net loss excluded the net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest. 

On
October 10, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of the Company s authorized, issued and
outstanding shares of the Company s common stock at a ratio of one (1)-for-twenty-five (25) (the Reverse Stock Split ).
The Reverse Stock Split became effective on October 31, 2024 (the Effective Date ), at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The Company s
common shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis at the commencement of trading on November 1, 2024. All equity awards outstanding
immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split,
all references to the Company s common stock in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q have been adjusted
to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 

Business
Segments 

The
Company conducts business through its three reportable segments including reinsurance, merchant banking, and managed services. The operating segments are determined based on the business activities and reflect the manner in which financial information
is currently evaluated by management. 

Reinsurance 

The
Company s wholly owned reinsurance subsidiary, FG Reinsurance Ltd FGRe ), a Cayman Islands limited liability company, provides specialty property and
casualty reinsurance. FGRe has been granted a Class B (iii) insurer license in accordance with the terms of The Insurance Act (as revised)
of the Cayman Islands and underlying regulations thereto and is subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (the Authority ).
The terms of the license require advance approval from the Authority should FGRe wish to enter into any reinsurance agreements which
are not fully collateralized. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had active reinsurance contracts, including participating in a Funds at Lloyds FAL syndicate covering risks written by the syndicate during the 2021, 2022 and 2023 calendar years. 

Merchant Banking 

We manage our merchant banking and asset management activities through FG Management Solutions LLC FGMS ),
formerly known as FG SPAC Solutions, LLC. Merchant banking services include various strategic, administrative, and regulatory support
services to newly formed SPACs (our SPAC platform). Additionally, the Company co-founded a partnership, FG Merchant Partners, LP FGMP ),
formerly known as FG SPAC Partners, LP, to participate as a co-sponsor for newly formed SPACs and other merchant banking clients. 

In addition, our merchant banking division has facilitated the launch of several new companies, including FG Communities,
Inc. FGC ), a self-managed real estate company focused on a growing portfolio of manufactured housing communities which
are owned and operated by FGC, and Craveworthy LLC Craveworthy ), an innovative fast casual restaurant platform company. 

Managed
Services 

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Strong Technical Services, Inc. STS ), is a leader in the entertainment
industry providing mission critical products and services to cinema exhibitors and entertainment venues for over 90 years. STS provides
comprehensive managed service offerings with 24/7/365 support nationwide to ensure solution uptime and availability. 

Other 

The
Company owned and operated its Digital Ignition technology incubator and co-working facility in Alpharetta, Georgia. During the first
quarter of 2024, the Company s board authorized the sale of Digital Ignition and on April 16, 2024, the Company completed the sale
of the Digital Ignition building and wholly owned subsidiary for proceeds of million. In April 2024, the Company received approximately
 million in cash, after payment of closing costs and repayment of debt at closing. In connection with the sale of the land and building,
the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately million during the first quarter of 2024 to adjust the carrying
value of the assets to the fair market value less costs to sell. 

Other also includes unallocated general and administrative expenses. 

The
determination of whether a legal entity is consolidated under either model is reassessed where there is a substantive change in the governing
documents or contractual arrangements of the entity, to the capital structure of the entity or in the activities of the entity. Management
continuously reassesses whether it should consolidate under either model. 

The
Company s risk of loss associated with its non-consolidated VIEs is limited. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value and maximum
loss exposure of the Company s non-consolidated VIE s was million. 

See
Note 5 for further information regarding the Company s holdings in equity securities and other holdings. 

of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that
demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to holdings in common stock
and to other holdings when such other holdings possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock. 

In
applying the equity method, we record the holding at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the holding
by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other
equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the holding. Should net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount
of the holding to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other holdings in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not
committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our
claim on the investee s book value. 

When
we receive distributions from our equity method holdings, we utilize the cumulative earnings approach. When classifying the related
cash flows under this approach, the Company compares the cumulative distributions received, less distributions received in prior periods,
with the Company s cumulative equity in earnings. Cumulative distributions that do not exceed cumulative equity in earnings represent
returns on holdings and are classified as cash inflows from operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of cumulative
equity in earnings represent returns on holdings and are classified as cash inflows from investing activities. 

In
addition to holdings accounted for under the equity method of accounting, other holdings also consist of equity we have purchased
in a limited partnership, a limited liability company, and a corporation for which there does not exist a readily determinable fair
value. The Company accounts for these holdings at their cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar holdings by the same issuer. When the Company observes
an orderly transaction of an investee s identical or similar equity securities, the Company adjusts the carrying value based
on the observable price as of the transaction date. Once the Company records such an adjustment, the holding is considered an
asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Any profit distributions the Company receives on these holdings are
included in net holdings income. 

See
Note 5 for additional information regarding the Company s holdings. 

Pursuant
to the Company s insurance license, the Authority has required that FGRe hold a minimum capital requirement of in cash
in a bank in the Cayman Islands which holds an A license issued under the Banks and Trust Companies Act (2020 Revision). 

. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held funds in
excess of these FDIC insured amounts. The terms of these deposits are on demand to mitigate some of the associated risk. The Company
has not incurred losses related to these deposits. The Company sells its products to a large number of customers in many different geographic
regions. To minimize credit risk related to accounts receivable, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
financial condition. 

The
Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately and of consolidated products and services revenues during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Trade accounts receivable from these customers represented approximately 
of net consolidated receivables at September 30, 2024. One of the Company s customers accounted for more than of both its consolidated
net revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and its net consolidated receivables as of September 30, 2024. While Management
believes its relationships with such customers are stable, most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by
either party. A significant decrease or interruption in business from the Company s significant customers could have a material
adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also be adversely affected
by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which the
Company sells its products and offers its services. 

The
Company combines contracts with the same customer into a single contract for accounting purposes when the contracts are entered into
at or near the same time and the contracts are negotiated as a single commercial package, consideration in one contract depends on the
other contract, or the services are considered a single performance obligation. If an arrangement involves multiple performance obligations,
the items are analyzed to determine the separate units of accounting, whether the items have value on a standalone basis and whether
there is objective and reliable evidence of their standalone selling price. The total contract transaction price is allocated to the
identified performance obligations based upon the relative standalone selling prices of the performance obligations. The standalone selling
price is based on an observable price for services sold to other comparable customers, when available, or an estimated selling price
using a cost plus margin approach. Management estimates the amount of total contract consideration the Company expects to receive for
variable arrangements by determining the most likely amount we expect to earn from the arrangement based on the expected quantities of
services the Company expects to provide and the contractual pricing based on those quantities. The Company only includes some or a portion
of variable consideration in the transaction price when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue
recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Management considers
the sensitivity of the estimate, the Company s relationship and experience with the client and variable services being performed,
the range of possible revenue amounts and the magnitude of the variable consideration to the overall arrangement. 

As
discussed in more detail below, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services under the terms of
a contract and is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing
services. The Company typically does not have any material extended payment terms, as payment is due at or shortly after the time of
the sale. Sales, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. 

The
Company recognizes contract assets or unbilled receivables related to revenue recognized for services completed but not yet invoiced
to the clients. Unbilled receivables are recorded as accounts receivable when we have an unconditional right to contract consideration.
A contract liability is recognized as deferred revenue when we invoice clients, or receive cash, in advance of performing the related
services under the terms of a contract. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when we have satisfied the related performance obligation. 

The
Company defers costs to acquire contracts, including commissions, incentives and payroll taxes, if they are incremental and recoverable
costs of obtaining a customer contract with a term exceeding one year. Deferred contract costs are reported within other assets and amortized
to selling expense over the contract term, which generally ranges from one to five years. The Company has elected to recognize the incremental
costs of obtaining a contract with a term of less than one year as a selling expense when incurred. The Company did not have any deferred
contract costs as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

The
financial assets included in the caption Reinsurance balances recoverable in the Company s consolidated balance sheets
are carried at amortized cost and therefore affected by ASU 2016-13. Management calculates an allowance for expected credit losses for
its reinsurance balances receivable by applying a Probability of Default / Loss Given Default model. The model considers both the external
collectability history as well as external loss history. The external loss history that Management utilizes includes a long-term probability
of liquidation study specific to insurance companies. Additionally, the life of each of the Company s reinsurance treaties is also
considered as the probability of default is calculated over the contractual length of the reinsurance contracts. The credit worthiness
of a counterparty is evaluated by considering the credit ratings assigned by independent agencies and individually evaluating all the
counterparties. The Company updates the model each quarter and adjusts the balance accordingly. There was no change to the allowance
during the third quarter of 2024. 

In
the first quarter of 2023, the Company allocated 
into a promissory note. The promissory note is carried at amortized cost on the Company s consolidated balance sheet under the
caption other equity securities and other holdings. Due to being held at amortized cost, the promissory note falls
into the scope of ASU 2016-13. Due to immateriality, the Company does not have a current expected credit allowance against the
promissory note. 

Trade
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company determines the allowance for credit losses
based on several factors, including overall customer credit quality, historical write-off experience and a specific analysis that projects
the ultimate collectability of the account. As such, these factors may change over time causing the allowance level and bad debt expense
to be adjusted accordingly. Past due accounts are written off when our efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting amounts due. 

million. 

GAAP does not permit establishing loss reserves,
which include case reserves and incurred but not reported loss reserves, until the occurrence of an event which may give rise to a claim.
As a result, only loss reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date are established, with no allowance for the establishment
of loss reserves to account for expected future loss events. 

Generally,
the Company obtains regular updates of premium and loss related information for the current and historical periods, which are utilized
by the Company to update the initial expected loss ratio. These reports from cedants have varying due dates and may be received between
thirty to ninety days after period end. We experience a lag between (i) claims being reported by the underlying insured to the Company s
cedent and (ii) claims being reported by the Company s cedent to the Company. This lag may impact the Company s loss reserve
estimates. The timing of the reporting requirements is designed so that the Company receives premium and loss information as soon as
practicable once the client has closed its books. Accordingly, there is generally a lag of one-to-three-month in such reporting. Most
of the contracts that have the potential for large single event losses have provisions that such loss notifications are provided to the
Company immediately upon the occurrence of an event. 

Right-of-use
assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the expected lease term at commencement
date. Certain of the leases contain extension options; however, the Company has not included such options as part of its right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities because it does not expect to extend the leases. The Company measures and records a right-of-use asset and
lease liability based on the discount rate implicit in the lease, if known. In cases where the discount rate implicit in the lease is
not known, the Company measures the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities using a discount rate equal to the Company s estimated
incremental borrowing rate for loans with similar collateral and duration. 

The
Company elected to not apply the recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases, to leases
of all classes of underlying assets that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option
to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Instead, lease payments for such short-term leases
are recognized in operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation
for those payments is incurred. 

The
Company elected, as a lessee, for all classes of underlying assets, to not separate nonlease components from lease components and instead
to account for each separate lease component and the nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. 

The merger involved a change of control between two
businesses and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 ). A
reverse acquisition occurs when the entity that issues securities (the legal acquirer) is identified as the acquiree for accounting purposes
and the entity whose equity interests are acquired (the legal acquiree) is identified as the acquirer for accounting purposes. FGH was
determined to be the accounting acquirer. 

Per
ASC 805, the acquirer measures the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. The
Company determined the fair value of the FGF assets and liabilities as of February 29, 2024 was approximately million. In a reverse
acquisition, generally the legal acquirer (accounting acquiree) issues consideration in the transaction. As such, the fair value of the
consideration transferred is determined based on the number of equity interests the accounting acquirer (legal acquiree) would have had
to issue to the owners of the legal acquirer (accounting acquiree) in order to provide the same ratio of ownership of equity interests
in the combined entity as a result of the reverse acquisition. Management determined total consideration was million, which resulted
in a bargain purchase gain of million. Management evaluated the bargain purchase gain and revisited the value of the individual
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger and determined that no adjustments to reduce the fair value of the assets or increase
the fair value of the liabilities assumed were necessary.

operations. 

As
stated in ASC 805, the acquirer in a business combination has a period of time, referred to as the measurement period, to finalize the
accounting for a business combination. The measurement period provides companies with a reasonable period of time to determine the value
of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and the consideration transferred for the acquiree. The
measurement period ends when the acquirer receives all necessary information about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date for the provisional amounts (or otherwise learns that more information is not obtainable); however, the measurement
period cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date. Management is in the process of finalizing the acquisition purchase price, which
remains subject to change. 

Net loss 

Net income (loss) 

million in cash and preferred and common shares of Saltire, consisting of: . In connection with the transaction, and after including the impact of the reclassification of
approximately million from accumulated other comprehensive income to realized loss on foreign exchange, the Company recorded a
net gain on the sale of Strong/MDI of approximately 
million, which is presented as a component of income from discontinued operations in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated statement of operations. 

Upon
completion of the transaction, Strong Global Entertainment holds an ownership interest of approximately in Saltire. 

Management
evaluated the classification of Strong/MDI as a discontinued operation as of September 30, 2024 and determined Strong/MDI is a component
of an entity and represented a discontinued operation. Accordingly, Strong/MDI has been included as part of discontinued operations for
all periods presented. 

Strong
Studios 

In
March 2022, Strong Studios acquired, from Landmark Studio Group LLC Landmark ), the
rights to original feature films and television series, and was assigned third party rights to content for global multiplatform distribution.
The transaction entailed the acquisition of certain projects which are in varying stages of development. During the second quarter of
2022, Safehaven 2022, Inc. Safehaven 2022 was established to manage the production and financing of the Safehaven
 television series, one of the in-process projects acquired from Landmark. 

In
September 2023, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Unbounded Media Corporation Unbounded ), an
independent media and creative production company. Unbounded developed, created and produced film, advertising, and branded content for
a broad range of clients. The Company expected Unbounded, in partnership with Strong Studios, would also further develop its original
IP portfolio, under its Fieldhouse Entertainment division, which included feature films employing Strong Studios long form production
expertise and industry network. 

As
of December 31, 2023, the board of directors of Strong Global Entertainment approved the Company s plan to exit its content business,
including Strong Studios and Unbounded and authorized management to proceed with such plan. The plan is expected to improve the Company s
focus on its core businesses, reduce general and administrative costs, and improve financial performance. The Company may receive proceeds
from the disposition of certain parts of the business and could recover development costs incurred in certain of the Strong Studios projects
in the future; however, any recovery is highly speculative, and management is not able to estimate the amount, timing or likelihood of
recoveries. These estimates may change based on the ultimate disposition of the operations and potential recoveries. 

Management
evaluated the classification of the content business as a discontinued operation as of December 31, 2023. The content business included
employees and operations that were dedicated solely to that portion of the overall business. In addition, the Company s accounting
system and bank accounts were set up in a manner that allowed for the cash flows to be clearly distinguished from the rest of the entity.
Management determined its content business is a component of an entity and represented a discontinued operation effective December 31,
2023. Accordingly, the content business has been included as part of discontinued operations for all periods presented. As noted above,
management began implementing the exit plan in late December 2023. All employees of the content business were notified of the Company s
plans to exit the business in December and management immediately began working to implement the exit plan. 

In
connection with the plan to exit the content business, the Company shut down the acquired Unbounded operations effective December 31,
2023. 

The
Company also entered into a letter of intent during December 2023 and executed a Stock Purchase Agreement effective January 1, 2024
for the sale of the majority of the Strong Studios operations (the Stock Purchase Agreement ). As a result, the Company
has classified the assets and liabilities to reflected as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2023. The assets and
liabilities transferred to the purchaser during the first quarter of 2024. 

Pursuant
to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company transferred the Strong Studios legal entity and all assets and liabilities related to Strong
Studios, except the assets and liabilities related to Safehaven. The Stock Purchase Agreement included a sales price of million
in cash, to be paid in installments, and assumption of certain liabilities of Strong Studios. In addition to the million purchase
price, the Company could recoup its holdings in the underlying projects in the future if the projects are profitably commercialized.
The first installment payment was due in February 2024, but the payment has not been received from the purchaser, and management is uncertain
if the cash purchase price will ultimately be received. As a result, the Company has adjusted the carrying value of the net assets related
to Strong Studios to . 

The
 Safehaven series was not transferred as part of the Stock Purchase Agreement as the Company and the other investors in the series
were involved in a dispute relating to the financial management of the project. As a result of the dispute and the impact on the Company s
ability to predict any future revenue participation from the sale/license of the series, the carrying value of the assets and liabilities
was adjusted to . In July 2024, the Company resolved the dispute, which did not result in any cash payments or a material impact to
its current period financial statements. In addition, the Company maintained a right to receive distributions to recover its investment
and to participate in series profits (if any).

Equity
Method Holdings 

As
of December 31, 2023, the Company s only equity method holding consisted of FGH s equity interests in FGF which was held
through its holding in FG Financial Holdings, LLC, which was eliminated in connection with the Merger. 

On
January 4, 2021, FGMP was formed as a Delaware limited partnership to co-sponsor newly formed SPACs with their founders or partners,
as well as other merchant banking interests. The Company is the sole managing member of the general partner of FGMP and holds a limited
partner interest of approximately in FGMP directly and through its subsidiaries. FGMP participates as a co-sponsor of the SPACs launched
under our SPAC Platform as well as merchant banking initiatives. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an equity method loss from FGMP of approximately million
and million, respectively. No capital contributions were made to FGMP during the quarter or nine months ended September 30, 2024.
Of the million carrying value of our holding in FGMP at September 30, 2024 the Company may allocate up to approximately million
to incentivize and compensate individuals and entities for the successful merger of SPACs launched under our platform.

Certain
holdings owned by our equity method investees are valued using Monte-Carlo simulation and option pricing models. Inherent in
Monte-Carlo simulation and option pricing models are assumptions related to expected volatility and discount for lack of
marketability of the underlying holding. Our investees estimate the volatility of these holdings based on the historical
performance of various broad market indices blended with various peer companies which they consider as having similar
characteristics to the underlying holding, as well as consideration of price and volatility of relevant publicly traded
securities such as SPAC warrants. Our investees also consider the probability of a successful merger when valuing equity for SPACs
that have not yet closed. Actual results from those holdings over time could vary significantly from estimates using Monte-Carlo
simulation and option pricing models. 

Cost
Method Holdings without Readily Determinable Fair Value 

In
addition to our equity method and fair value method holdings, other holdings which do not have a readily determinable fair value are
accounted for at their cost, subject to any adjustment from time to time due to impairment or observable price changes in orderly transactions.
When the Company observes an orderly transaction of an investee s identical or similar equity securities, the Company adjusts the
carrying value based on the observable price as of the transaction date. Any profit distributions the Company receives on these holdings
are included in net holdings income. The Company is not aware of any issuances of identical or similar equities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. As a result, the carrying value of holdings without readily determinable fair value did not change during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
Company s other holdings include a convertible promissory note and a senior unsecured promissory note. 

On
September 29, 2023, the Company invested in a convertible promissory note with ThinkMarkets, of which has been repaid
through September 30, 2024. The promissory note has an interest rate of annually, with interest payments due monthly, and matures
on August 1, 2025. Commencing upon the closing of the contemplated business combination, the Company has the option to convert any unpaid
loan amount and all accrued and unpaid interest into fully paid shares of FGAC common stock, at a conversion price of per share.
The Company evaluated the convertible promissory note s settlement provisions and elected the fair value option to value this instrument.
Under the fair value election, the convertible promissory note is measured initially and subsequently at fair value. As of September
30, 2024, the fair value was calculated to be . 

On
March 16, 2023, the Company invested 
in a senior unsecured loan to Craveworthy. The loan had an interest rate of 
and a maturity of . The senior unsecured note was amended to a convertible bridge loan on October 17, 2023, and the maturity date was
changed to October 16, 2024. In November 2024, the Company and Craveworthy extended the maturity date to April 16, 2025. The 
principal and any interest accrued may be prepaid voluntarily by Craveworthy but is not required to be paid until the date of
maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the entire principal amount of 
as well as approximately 
of accrued interest was outstanding. 

Impairment 

For
equity securities without readily determinable fair values, impairment is determined via a qualitative assessment which considers
indicators to evaluate whether the holding is impaired. Some of these indicators include a significant deterioration in the earnings
performance or asset quality of the investee, a significant adverse change in regulatory, economic or general market conditions in
which the investee operates, or doubt over an investee s ability to continue as a going concern. If the holding is deemed
to be impaired after conducting this analysis, management would estimate the fair value of the holding to determine the amount
of impairment loss. 

For
equity method holdings, evidence of a loss in value might include a series of operating losses of an investee, the absence of an ability
to recover the carrying amount of the holding, or a deterioration in the value of the investee s underlying assets. If these,
or other indicators lead to the conclusion that there is a decrease in the value of the holding that is other than temporary, the Company
would recognize that decrease in value even though the decrease may be in excess of what would otherwise be recognized under the equity
method of accounting. 

The
risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine impairment include, but may not be limited to, the following: 

the
 opinions of professional investment managers and appraisers could be incorrect; 

the
 past operating performance and cash flows generated from the investee s operations may not reflect their future performance;
 and 

the
 estimated fair values for holdings for which observable market prices are not available are inherently imprecise. 

The
Company did not record an impairment on its holdings during the quarter or nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Fair
Value Measurements 

The
Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal
or most advantageous market. The FASB has issued guidance that defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an
asset (or paid to transfer a liability) in the principal, or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants.
This guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The guidance categorizes assets and liabilities at fair value into one of three
different levels depending on the observation of the inputs employed in the measurements, as follows: 

Level
 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets providing the
 most reliable measurement of fair value since it is directly observable. 

Level
 2 inputs to the valuation methodology which include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. These
 inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full-term of the financial instrument. 

Level
 3 inputs to the valuation methodology which are unobservable and significant to the measurement of fair value. 

The
availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from holding to holding and are affected by a variety of factors,
including the type of holding, whether the holding is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets
and other characteristics specific to the individual holding. In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized
within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in
the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. When determining fair value, the Company
uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

The
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act provides for a territorial tax system, which began in 2018. It includes the global intangible low-taxed
income GILTI provision. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary
earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary s tangible assets. The GILTI provisions also allow for a high-tax
exclusion if the effective tax rate of the tested income is greater than . The Company has evaluated these regulations in determining
the appropriate amount of the inclusion for the tax provision. The effective tax rate on the tested income is greater than ; thus,
the Company is utilizing the GILTI high-tax exclusion for purposes of the tax provision for the three and nine months ended September

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

Revenue
increased 6.4 million or 155.8 to 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. 

The
primary driver of revenue growth was the addition of 4.3 million of reinsurance premium revenue resulting from the Merger in February
2024 and a 2.2 million increase in revenue from STS. The growth in revenue from STS was due to the acquisition of the net assets of
Innovative Cinema Solutions, LLC ICS in late 2023 combined with increased demand from cinema operators for installation
services. 

 Expenses 

Total
expenses increased 7.4 million or 91.1 to 15.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.1 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses are comprised of cost of sales related to the Strong Entertainment operating business, costs
of the reinsurance and asset management business and selling, general and administrative expenses. 

The
increase in total expenses was primarily due to the addition of the FGF business operations following the merger in February 2024
which added 6.0 million in reinsurance expenses and general and administrative expenses in the third quarter. In addition, the
Company s costs of revenue increased commensurate with the revenue growth at STS. 

Loss
from Operations 

Loss
from operations increased 1.0 million to 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.0 million during the
third quarter of 2023. Higher general and administrative costs due to
the addition of FGF, which is not included in the prior period comparisons, were partially offset by improved gross profit
contribution from STS.

Loss from Continuing Operations 

Net
loss from continuing operations increased to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.9 million during the
third quarter of 2023. Improvements in gross profit from Strong Entertainment were partially offset by increased general and administrative costs related to both operating Strong Entertainment as a separate public company and
the addition of FGF, which is not included in the prior period comparisons. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

Revenue
increased 13.0 million or 123.4 to 23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

The
primary driver of revenue growth was the addition of 8.8 million of reinsurance premium revenue resulting from the Merger in
February 2024 and a 4.7 million increase in revenue from STS, partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in holdings losses
compared with the prior year period. The growth in revenue from STS was due to the acquisition of the net assets of ICS in late 2023
and increased demand from cinema operators for installation services. Holdings income was unfavorable as the Company s non-cash
equity method losses were higher in the current year period. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes seven months of
reinsurance and holdings operating results from the acquired FGF business lines. 

Expenses 

Total
expenses increased 15.8 million or 61.7 to 41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 25.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses are comprised of cost of sales related to STS operating business, costs
of the reinsurance and asset management business and selling, general and administrative expenses. 

The
increase in total expenses was primarily due to the addition of the FGF business operations the Merger in February 2024 which added
 11.0 million in reinsurance expenses and general and administrative expenses in the nine-month period. In addition, the
Company s costs of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses increased with growth at STS and
as a result of operating Strong Entertainment as a separate public company. The Company also recognized a 1.4 million non-cash
impairment related to the sale of the Digital Ignition building. 

Loss
from Operations 

Loss
from operations increased 2.7 million or 18.3 to 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.0 million during
the first quarter of 2023. Improved gross profit contributions from STS were offset by increased general and administrative
costs related to both operating Strong Entertainment as a separate public company and the addition of FGF, which is not included in the
prior period comparisons, as well as a non-cash impairment loss of 1.4 million related to the sale of Digital Ignition. 

Net
Loss from Continuing Operations 

Net
loss from continuing operations increased 1.2 million or 8.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.9 million during
the first nine months of 2023. Improved gross profit contributions from STS and a 1.8 million gain related to the FGF
merger transaction were offset by increased general and administrative costs related to both operating Strong Entertainment as a separate
public company and the addition of FGF which is not included in the prior period comparisons as well as a non-cash impairment loss of
 1.4 million related to the sale of Digital Ignition.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Critical
accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant
level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results
of operations. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Set forth below is qualitative and quantitative information
necessary to understand the estimation uncertainty and the impact the critical accounting estimate has had or is reasonably likely to
have on financial condition or results of operations, to the extent the information is material and reasonably available. 

Other
Holdings 

Other
holdings consist, in part, of equity holdings made in privately held companies accounted for under the equity method. As discussed
further in Note 5, certain holdings held by our equity method investees are valued using Monte-Carlo simulation and option pricing
models. Inherent in Monte-Carlo simulation and option pricing models are assumptions related to expected volatility and discount for
lack of marketability of the underlying holding. Our investees estimate the volatility of these holdings based on the historical
performance of various broad market indices blended with various peer companies which they consider as having similar characteristics
to the underlying holding, as well as consideration of price and volatility of relevant publicly traded securities such as SPAC warrants.
Our investees also consider the probability of a successful merger when valuing equity for SPACs that have not yet completed a business
combination. 

Current
Expected Credit Loss 

Upon
adoption of ASU 2016-13, as amended, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, the Company calculated an allowance for expected
credit losses for its reinsurance balances receivable by applying a Probability of Default / Loss Given Default model. The model
considers both the external collectability history as well as external loss history. The external loss history that the Company used
included a long-term probability of liquidation study specific to insurance companies. Additionally, the life of each of the
Company s reinsurance treaties was also considered as the probability of default was calculated over the contractual length of
the reinsurance contracts. The credit worthiness of a counterparty is evaluated by considering the credit ratings assigned by
independent agencies and individually evaluating all the counterparties. 

Trade
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Management determines the allowance for expected credit
losses based on several factors, including overall customer credit quality, historical write-off experience and a specific analysis that
projects the ultimate collectability of the account. As such, these factors may change over time causing the allowance level and provision
for expected credit losses to be adjusted accordingly. Past due accounts are written off when our efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting
amounts due. 

Valuation
of Net Deferred Income Taxes 

The
provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in the Company s consolidated
financial statements. In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company interprets tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions
and makes assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of net
deferred income taxes. 

The
ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which the Company s temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more
likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation
allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances,
including the Company s past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability
of tax planning strategies. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income
tax provision in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. 

41 

Premium
Revenue Recognition 

The
Company participates in reinsurance quota-share contracts and estimates the ultimate premiums for the contract period. These estimates
are based on information received from the ceding companies, whereby premiums are recorded as written in the same periods in which the
underlying insurance contracts are written and are based on cession statements from cedents. These statements are received quarterly
and in arrears, and thus, for any reporting lag, premiums written are estimated based on the portion of the ultimate estimated premiums
relating to the risks underwritten during the lag period. Premium estimates are reviewed by management periodically. Such review includes
a comparison of actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums. Based on management s review, the appropriateness of the
premium estimates is evaluated, and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Changes
in premium estimates, including premiums receivable, are not unusual and may result in significant adjustments in any period. A significant
portion of amounts included in the caption Reinsurance balances receivable in the Company s consolidated balance
sheets represent estimated premiums written, net of commissions, brokerage, and loss and loss adjustment expense, and are not currently
due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Premiums written are generally recognized as earned over the contract period in proportion
to the risk covered. Additional premiums due on a contract that has no remaining coverage period are earned in full when written. Unearned
premiums represent the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided. 

Revenue
Recognition for Products and Services 

The
Company accounts for revenue using the following steps: 

Identify
 the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 

Identify
 the performance obligations in the contract; 

Determine
 the transaction price; 

Allocate
 the transaction price to the identified performance obligations; and 

Recognize
 revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies the performance obligations. 

We
combine contracts with the same customer into a single contract for accounting purposes when the contracts are entered into at or near
the same time and the contracts are negotiated as a single commercial package, consideration in one contract depends on the other contract,
or the services are considered a single performance obligation. If an arrangement involves multiple performance obligations, the items
are analyzed to determine the separate units of accounting, whether the items have value on a standalone basis and whether there is objective
and reliable evidence of their standalone selling price. The total contract transaction price is allocated to the identified performance
obligations based upon the relative standalone selling prices of the performance obligations. The standalone selling price is based on
an observable price for services sold to other comparable customers, when available, or an estimated selling price using a cost plus
margin approach. We estimate the amount of total contract consideration we expect to receive for variable arrangements by determining
the most likely amount we expect to earn from the arrangement based on the expected quantities of services we expect to provide and the
contractual pricing based on those quantities. We only include some or a portion of variable consideration in the transaction price when
it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated
with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We consider the sensitivity of the estimate, our relationship and experience
with the client and variable services being performed, the range of possible revenue amounts and the magnitude of the variable consideration
to the overall arrangement. 

As
discussed in more detail below, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services under the terms of
a contract and is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing
services. We typically do not have any material extended payment terms, as payment is due at or shortly after the time of the sale. Sales,
value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. 

We
recognize contract assets or unbilled receivables related to revenue recognized for services completed but not yet invoiced to the clients.
Unbilled receivables are recorded as accounts receivable when we have an unconditional right to contract consideration. A contract liability
is recognized as deferred revenue when we invoice clients, or receive cash, in advance of performing the related services under the terms
of a contract. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when we have satisfied the related performance obligation. 

42 

We
defer costs to acquire contracts, including commissions, incentives and payroll taxes, if they are incremental and recoverable costs
of obtaining a customer contract with a term exceeding one year. Deferred contract costs are reported within other assets and amortized
to selling expense over the contract term, which generally ranges from one to five years. The Company has elected to recognize the incremental
costs of obtaining a contract with a term of less than one year as a selling expense when incurred. We did not have any deferred contract
costs as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Deferred
Policy Acquisition Costs 

Policy
acquisition costs are costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the successful production of new and renewal reinsurance business,
and consist principally of commissions, taxes, and brokerage expenses. If the sum of a contract s expected losses and loss expenses
and deferred acquisition costs exceeds associated unearned premiums and expected income on holdings, a premium deficiency is determined
to exist. In this event, deferred acquisition costs are written off to the extent necessary to eliminate the premium deficiency. If the
premium deficiency exceeds deferred acquisition costs, then a liability is accrued for the excess deficiency. There were no premium deficiency
adjustments recognized during the periods presented herein. 

Loss
and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves 

Loss
and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates are based on estimates derived from reports received from ceding companies. These estimates
are periodically reviewed by the Company s management and adjusted as necessary. Since reserves are estimates, the final settlement
of losses may vary from the reserves established and any adjustments to the estimates, which may be material, are recorded in the period
they are determined. 

Loss estimates may also be based upon actuarial and
statistical projections, an assessment of currently available data, predictions of future developments, estimates of future trends and
other factors. Significant assumptions used by the Company s management and third-party actuarial specialists include loss development
factor selections, initial expected loss ratio selections, and weighting of methods used. The final settlement of losses may vary, perhaps
materially, from the reserves recorded. All adjustments to the estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined. GAAP
does not permit establishing loss reserves, which include case reserves and incurred but not reported loss reserves, until the occurrence
of an event which may give rise to a claim. As a result, only loss reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date are
established, with no allowance for the establishment of loss reserves to account for expected future loss events. Generally, the Company
obtains regular updates of premium and loss related information for the current and historical periods, which are utilized to update the
initial expected loss ratio. We also experience lag between (i) claims being reported by the underlying insured to the Company s
cedent and (ii) claims being reported by the Company s cedent to the Company. This lag may impact the Company s loss reserve
estimates. Cedent reports have pre-determined due dates (for example, thirty days after each month end). As a result, the lag depends
in part upon the terms of the specific contract. The timing of the reporting requirements is designed so that the Company receives premium
and loss information as soon as practicable once the cedent has closed its books. Accordingly, there should be a short lag in such reporting.
Additionally, most of the contracts that have the potential for large single event losses have provisions that such loss notifications
are provided to the Company immediately upon the occurrence of an event. 

Stock-Based
Compensation Expense 

The
Company uses the fair-value method of accounting for stock-based compensation awards granted. The Company has determined the fair value
of its outstanding stock options on their grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model along with multiple Monte Carlo simulations
to determine a derived service period as the options vest based upon meeting certain performance conditions. The Company determines the
fair value of restricted stock units RSUs on their grant date using the fair value of the Company s common stock
on the date the RSUs were issued (for those RSU which vest solely based upon the passage of time). The fair value of these awards is
recorded as compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the expected period over which the awards will
vest, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. When the stock options are exercised, or correspondingly, when the
RSUs vest, the amount of proceeds together with the amount recorded in additional paid-in capital is recorded in shareholders 
equity.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they
fall due. The liquidity requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been met primarily by funds generated from operations,
proceeds from the sales of our common stock and credit facilities. 

Cash
Flows

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was approximately 3.1 million,
compared to 1.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash from operations decreased due to a net cash outflow for working capital,
including an increase in net outflows related to our insurance business, which were partially offset by an improvement in Strong Global
Entertainment s results from operations. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was approximately
 10.4 million, compared to 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by investing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 1.9 million of an increase in cash as a result of the Merger of FGF and FGH, 2.3
million of proceeds from the sale of equity securities and 6.1 million from the sale of the Digital Ignition building. Investing
cash flows during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included approximately 0.1 million of capital
expenditures in the managed services business. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was approximately 6.9 million,
compared to cash provided by financing activities of 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 5.5 million of principal payments on debt and finances leases and
 1.3 million of payments of dividends on our Series A Preferred Shares. Cash by financing activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2023 included 2.4 million of net proceeds from the IPO of Strong Global Entertainment, partially offset by 0.7 million of principal
payments on debt and finances leases.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer
and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of
the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the
Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the merger or FGF and FGH as of February 29, 2024, the Company s overall
control environment and its internal controls over financial reporting now incorporate the internal controls over financial reporting
that continue in place for FGH as well as FGF. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company is involved, from time to time, in certain legal disputes in the ordinary course of business. No such disputes, individually
or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material effect on the Company s business or financial condition. 

Fundamental
Global is named as a defendant in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. A majority of
the cases involve product liability claims based principally on allegations of past distribution of commercial lighting products containing
wiring that may have contained asbestos. Each case names dozens of corporate defendants in addition to Fundamental Global. In Fundamental
Global s experience, a large percentage of these types of claims have never been substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts.
Fundamental Global has not suffered any adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims and intends to continue
to defend these lawsuits. Under the Fundamental Global Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to indemnify Fundamental Global for
future losses, if any related to current product liability or personal injury claims arising out of products sold or distributed in the
U.S. by the operations of the businesses being transferred to the Company in the Separation, in an aggregate amount not to exceed 250,000
per year, as well as to indemnify Fundamental Global for all expenses (including legal fees) related to the defense of such claims. As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has a loss contingency reserve of approximately 0.1 million, which represents the Company s
estimate of its potential losses related to the settlement of open cases. When appropriate, Fundamental Global may settle additional
claims in the future. The Company does not expect the resolution of these cases to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

45 

On
April 29, 2024, Ravenwood-Productions LLC Ravenwood and Kevin V. Duncan Duncan and, together with Ravenwood,
the Plaintiffs filed a civil complaint (the Complaint against Strong Global Entertainment, certain affiliated
entities, and certain current and former employees, officers and directors of the Strong Global Entertainment (collectively, the Defendants in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Complaint claimed seven causes of action, each claim
against some, or all, of the Defendants. In July 2024, Strong Global Entertainment entered into an agreement resulting in the settlement
and dismissal of the Complaint. In connection with the settlement and dismissal, Strong Global Entertainment did not make any cash payments
to the Plaintiffs. In addition, Strong Global Entertainment maintained a right to receive distributions to recover our investment and
to participate in series profits (if any). 

On
July 16, 2024, we received notice that we were named as a defendant, along with over 500 other companies, in a civil action filed for
cost recovery and contributions related to the release and/or threatened release of hazardous substances from a facility known as the
BKK Class 1 Landfill in Los Angeles County California from periods prior to 1987. The action alleges that FGH is a successor to Pichel
Industries, Inc. Pichel Industries and that Pichel Industries contributed waste to the landfill. We are in the early
stages of evaluating the claim and determining our response. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

In
addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024, we are subject to the following additional risk factors as a result
of the Merger: 

The
Company is expected to incur significant costs related to the Merger and integration. 

The
Company has incurred and expects to incur certain non-recurring costs associated with the merger and integration of FGH and FGF. These
costs include legal, financial advisory, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees, insurance, public company filing fees and other
regulatory fees, printing costs and other related costs. The combined company may also incur expenses in connection with the integration
of operations. There are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs. Moreover, many of the
costs that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration costs may result in the Company
taking charges against earnings in future periods. 

Integrating
the businesses may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits
of the Merger. 

The
success of the Company will depend, in part, on the Company s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of FGF
and FGH in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing operations or result in decreased revenue or reputational harm. It is possible
that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company s ongoing businesses,
difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure
and financial reporting and internal control systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely
affect the companies ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits
and cost savings of the Merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These
integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company. 

The
future results following the Merger may suffer if the Company does not effectively manage its expanded operations. 

The
Company s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose challenges for
management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity.
The Company may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of its
business. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies,
cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the Merger. 

46 

The
Company may be unable to retain current personnel successfully following the Merger. 

The
success of the Company will depend in part on its ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees and officers.
It is possible that these employees and officers may decide not to remain with the Company. If FGF and FGH are unable to retain key employees,
including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, FGF and FGH could face disruptions
in their operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment
costs. In addition, if key employees terminate their employment, the Company s business activities may be adversely affected and
management s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating the businesses to hiring suitable replacements, all of which
may cause the Company s business to suffer. In addition, the Company may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements
for any key employees who leave either company. 

We
have no assurance of future business from any of our customers. 

We
estimate future revenue associated with customers and customer prospects for purposes of financial planning and measurement of our sales
pipeline, but we have limited contractual assurance of future business from our customers. While we do have arrangements with some of
our customers, customers are not required to purchase any minimum amounts and could stop doing business with us. Some customers maintain
simultaneous relationships with our competitors and could shift more of their business away from us if they choose to do so in the future. 

There
is no guarantee that we will be able to service and retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers
or business partners on acceptable terms or at all, or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers or business partners. The
loss of any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Our
operating results could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products and services and adequately
manage our inventory. 

To
ensure adequate inventory supply, we forecast inventory needs, place orders and plan personnel levels based on estimates of future demand.
Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and services is limited and could be affected by many factors, including an
increase or decrease in customer demand for our products and services or for products and services of our competitors, product and service
introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the weakening
of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may
experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for
our products and services, we may not be able to deliver products to meet requirements, and this could result in damage to our brand
and customer relationships and adversely affect our revenue and operating results. 

Interruptions
of, or higher prices of, components from our suppliers may affect our results of operations and financial performance. 

A
portion of our revenues is dependent on the distribution of products supplied by various key suppliers. If we fail to maintain satisfactory
relationships with our suppliers, or if our suppliers experience significant financial difficulties, we could experience difficulty in
obtaining needed goods and services. Some suppliers could also decide to reduce inventories or raise prices to increase cash flow. The
loss of any one or more of our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, and we may be unable to secure alternative manufacturing
arrangements. Even if we are able to obtain alternative manufacturing arrangements, such arrangements may not be on terms similar to
our current arrangements, or we may be forced to accept less favorable terms in order to secure a supplier as quickly as possible so
as to minimize the impact on our business operations. In addition, any required changes in our suppliers could cause delays in our operations
and increase our production costs and new suppliers may not be able to meet our production demands as to volume, quality, or timeliness. 

Geopolitical
conditions, military conflicts, acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, and other conditions or events beyond our
control could adversely affect us. 

Geopolitical
conditions, military conflicts (including Russia s invasion of Ukraine), acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics
(including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition, or prospects. For example, military conflicts, acts or threats of terrorism, and political, financial, or military
actions taken in response could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us, especially as an
intermediary within the financial system. In addition, nation states engaged in warfare or other hostile actions may directly or indirectly
use cyberattacks against financial systems and financial-services companies like us to exert pressure on one another or other countries
with influence or interests at stake. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees,
or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident,
or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well
as their own third-party service providers and counterparties. 

47 

The
most notable impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations was the significant impact to our customers, specifically those in the entertainment
and advertising industries, and their ability and willingness to purchase our products and services. A significant number of our customers
temporarily ceased operations during the pandemic. For instance, many movie theaters and other entertainment centers were forced to close
or curtail their hours and, correspondingly, terminated or deferred their non-essential capital expenditures. The COVID-19 pandemic also
adversely affected film production and the pipeline of feature films available in the short- and long-term. We were also required to
temporarily close our screen manufacturing facility in Canada due to the governmental response to COVID-19, experienced lower revenues
from field services, and saw a reduction in non-recurring time and materials-based services. The impact of any future outbreak of contagious
disease, or a worsening or resurgence of COVID-19, is not readily ascertainable, is uncertain and cannot be predicted, but could have
an adverse impact on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In
the case of Russia s invasion of Ukraine, security risks as well as increases in fuel and other commodity costs, supply-chain disruptions,
and associated inflationary pressures have impacted our business the most. 

We
may also experience one or more of the following conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and
financial condition: adverse effects on our strategic partners businesses or on the businesses of companies in which we hold equity
stakes; impairment charges; extreme currency exchange-rate fluctuations; inability to recover costs from insurance carriers; and business
continuity concerns for us, our customers and our third-party vendors. 

These
conditions and events and others like them are highly complex and inherently uncertain, and their effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition, and prospects in the future cannot be reliably predicted. 

Changes
in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, domestic and foreign trade policies, monetary policies and other factors beyond
our control may adversely impact our business and operating results. 

Our
operations and performance may depend on global, regional, economic and geopolitical conditions. Russia s invasion and military
attacks on Ukraine have triggered significant sanctions from North American and European leaders. These events continue to develop and
escalate, creating increasingly volatile global economic conditions. Resulting changes in North American trade policy could trigger retaliatory
actions by Russia, its allies and other affected countries, including China, resulting in a trade war. A trade war could
result in increased costs for raw materials that we use in our manufacturing and could otherwise limit our ability to sell our products
abroad. These increased costs would have a negative effect on our financial condition and profitability. Furthermore, events like the
military conflict between Russia and Ukraine may increase the likelihood of supply interruptions and further hinder our ability to find
the materials we need to make our products. If the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues for a long period of time, or if other
countries become further involved in the conflict, we could face significant adverse effects to our business and financial condition. 

Environmental,
social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation. 

Increasingly,
in addition to the importance of their financial performance, companies are being judged by their performance on a variety of environmental,
social and governance ESG matters, which are considered to contribute to the long-term sustainability of companies 
performance. 

A
variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized.
In addition, investments in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major
institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of ESG measures to their investment decisions. Topics taken into account
in such assessments include, among others, companies efforts and impacts on climate change and human rights, ethics and compliance
with law, diversity and the role of companies board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues. 

48 

ESG
goals and values are embedded in our core mission and vision, and we consider their potential impact on the sustainability of our business
over time and the potential impact of our business on society. However, in light of investors increased focus on ESG matters,
there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet society s expectations
as to our proper role. This could lead to risk of litigation or reputational damage relating to our ESG policies or performance. 

Further,
possible actions to address ESG issues may not maximize short-term financial results and may yield financial results that conflict with
the market s expectations. We have and may in the future make business decisions that may reduce our short-term financial results
if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our ESG goals, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long-term.
These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term benefits
that we expect, in which case our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed. 

The
markets for our products and services are highly competitive and if market share is lost, we may be unable to lower our cost structure
quickly enough to offset the loss of revenue. 

The
domestic and international markets for our product lines are highly competitive, evolving and subject to rapid technological and other
changes. We expect the intensity of competition in each of these areas to continue in the future for a number of reasons including: 

Certain
 of our competitors in the digital equipment industry have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing
 and other resources than we do, which, among other things, may permit them to adopt aggressive pricing policies. As a result, we
 may suffer from pricing pressures that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and our results of operations. Some
 of our competitors also have greater name and brand recognition and a larger customer base than us. 

Some
 of our competitors are manufacturing their own digital equipment while we employ a distribution business model through our distribution
 agreements with NEC Display Solutions of America, Inc., Barco, Inc. and certain other suppliers.
 As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressures that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. 

Suppliers
 could decide to utilize their current sales force to supply their products directly to customers rather than utilizing channels. 

In
addition, we face competition for consumer attention from other forms of entertainment, including streaming services and other forms
of entertainment that may impact the cinema industry. The other forms of entertainment may be more attractive to consumers than those
utilizing our technologies, which could harm our business, prospects and operating results. 

For
these and other reasons, we must continue to enhance our technologies and our existing products and services, and introduce new, high-quality
technologies and products and services to meet the wide variety of competitive pressures that we face. If we are unable to compete successfully,
our business, prospects and results of operations will be materially adversely impacted. 

We
depend in part on distributors, dealers and resellers to sell and market our products and services, and our failure to maintain and further
develop our sales channels could harm our business. 

In
addition to our in-house sales force, we sell some of our products and services through distributors, dealers and resellers. As we do
not have long-term contracts and these agreements may be cancelled at any time, any changes to our current mix of distributors could
adversely affect our gross margin and could negatively affect both our brand image and our reputation. If our distributors, dealers and
resellers are not successful in selling our products, our revenue would decrease. In addition, our success in expanding and entering
into new markets internationally will depend on our ability to establish relationships with new distributors. If we do not maintain our
relationship with existing distributors or develop relationships with new distributors, dealers and resellers our ability to grow our
business and sell our products and services could be adversely affected and our business may be harmed. 

49 

Our
capital allocation strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact our financial condition. 

We
intend to continue investing part of our cash balances in public and private companies and may engage in mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.
We intend our holdings in public companies to be made in circumstances where we believe that we will be able to exercise some degree
of influence or control. We may also continue to invest in private companies or other areas, including acquisitions of businesses. These
types of holdings are riskier than holding our cash balances as bank deposits or, for example, conservative options such as treasury
bonds or money market funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance the value or the performance of the
companies in which we have invested or may invest in the future, or that we will achieve returns or benefits from these holdings. Under
certain circumstances, significant declines in the fair values of these holdings may require the recognition of other-than-temporary
impairment losses. We may lose all or part of our holdings relating to such companies if their value decreases as a result of their financial
performance or for any other reason. If our interests differ from those of other investors in companies over which we do not have control,
we may be unable to effect any change at those companies. We are not required to meet any diversification standards, and our holdings
may continue to remain concentrated. In addition, we may seek to sell some or all of our existing businesses as part of our holding company
strategy. 

If
our capital allocation strategy is not successful or we achieve less than expected returns from these holdings, it could have a material
adverse effect on us. The Board of Directors may also change our capital allocation strategy at any time, and such changes could further
increase our exposure, which could adversely impact us. 

If
we are unable to maintain our brand and reputation, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed. 

Our
business, results of operations and prospects depend, in part, on maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation for providing
high quality products and services. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions. Although reputations may take decades to
build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental
investigations or litigation. If problems with our products cause operational disruption or other difficulties, or there are delays or
other issues with the delivery of our products or services, our brand and reputation could be diminished. Damage to our reputation could
also arise from actual or perceived legal violations, product safety issues, data security breaches, actual or perceived poor employee
relations, actual or perceived poor service, actual or perceived poor privacy practices, operational or sustainability issues, actual
or perceived ethical issues or other events within or outside of our control that generate negative publicity with respect to us. Any
event that has the potential to negatively impact our reputation could lead to lost sales, loss of new opportunities and retention and
recruiting difficulties. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand and reputation successfully, our business, results of operations
and prospects could be materially harmed. 

Our
operating margins may decline as a result of increasing product costs. 

Our
business is subject to pressure on pricing and costs caused by many factors, including supply chain disruption, intense competition,
the cost of components used in our products, labor costs, constrained sourcing capacity, inflationary pressure, pressure from customers
to reduce the prices we charge for our products and services, and changes in consumer demand. Factors including global supply chain
disruptions have resulted in shortages in labor, materials and services. Such shortages have resulted in cost increases, particularly
for labor, and could continue to increase. Costs for the raw materials used to manufacture our products are affected by, among other
things, energy prices, demand, fluctuations in commodity prices and currency, shipping costs and other factors that are generally unpredictable
and beyond our control such as the escalating military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Increases in the cost of raw materials used
to manufacture our products or in the cost of labor and other costs of doing business internationally could have an adverse effect on,
among other things, the cost of our products, gross margins, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. 

50 

Our
sales cycle can be long and timing of orders and shipments unpredictable, particularly with respect to large enterprises, which could
harm our business and operating results. 

The
timing of our sales is difficult to predict, and customers typically order screen and other distribution products with limited advance
notice which impacts our ability to forecast revenue and manage operations. For our managed service offerings, the sales cycle can be
long and involve educating and achieving buy-in from multiple parts of a customer organization. As a result, the length and variable
nature of customer ordering patterns and timing could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations. 

We
are substantially dependent upon significant customers who could cease purchasing our products at any time. 

The
Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 43 and 40 of consolidated products and services revenues during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Trade accounts receivable from these customers represented approximately 59 
of net consolidated receivables at September 30, 2024. One of the Company s customers accounted for more than 10 of both its consolidated
net revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and its net consolidated receivables as of September 30, 2024. While the
Company believes its relationships with such customers are stable, most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at
will by either party. A significant decrease or interruption in business from the Company s significant customers could have a
material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also be adversely
affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in
which the Company sells its products and offers its services. 

Government
agencies in Canada have notified Strong/MDI that certain modifications are required to be made to the Joliette Plant in order to meet
safety and emissions standards. 

Strong/MDI
has been informed by certain government agencies in Canada, including but not limited to, the Joliette Fire Department, and the Quebec
Ministry of the Environment, that certain aspects of the Joliette Plant must be modified to fully comply with safety and emissions standards.
Strong/MDI has implemented changes to address some, but not all, of the identified requirements. 

The
required modifications include installing new air evaluator and exhaust chimneys as well as modifying the walls and doors in the paint
and coatings area to achieve a 2-hour fire resistance standard. In addition, it was required that we modify certain mezzanine areas to
reduce their size and upgrade construction to non-combustible materials, add an additional exterior access, and purchase spill resistant
pallets. If we fail to address the requirements, it could be possible that we could incur penalties or production could be interrupted.
The expansion could cost more or take longer than our expectations and could result in production disruptions in the facility during
the construction process. 

Our
business is subject to the economic and political risks of selling products in foreign countries. 

We
expect that international sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. Foreign sales are subject to
general political and economic risks, including the adverse impact of changes to international trade and tariff policies, including in
the U.S. and China, which have created uncertainty regarding international trade, unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising
from host country laws or regulations, unfavorable changes in U.S. policies on international trade and investment, the imposition of
governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business, quotas, capital controls or other trade barriers, whether adopted
by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocks, threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, currency controls,
fluctuating exchange rates with respect to sales not denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight
rates, potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies, restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country
and the disruption of operations from labor, political and other disturbances, such as the impact of the coronavirus and other public
health epidemics or pandemics. Government policies on international trade and investment can affect the demand for our products, impact
the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell or manufacture products in certain countries. The implementation
of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of
products and services could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a government s
adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact
on our results of operations. If we were unable to navigate the foreign regulatory environment, or if we were unable to enforce our contractual
rights in foreign countries, our business could be adversely impacted. Any of these events could reduce our sales, limit the prices at
which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance. 

51 

To
the extent that orders are denominated in foreign currencies, our reported sales and earnings are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations.
In addition, there can be no assurance that our remaining international customers will continue to accept orders denominated in U.S.
dollars. For those sales which are denominated in U.S. dollars, a weakening in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar
could have a material adverse impact on us by increasing the effective price of our products in international markets. Certain areas
of the world are also more cost conscious than the U.S. market and there are instances where our products are priced higher than local
manufacturers. We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations between the Canadian and U.S. dollar due to our screen manufacturing
facility in Canada where a majority of its sales are denominated in the U.S. dollar while its expenses are denominated in Canadian currency.
We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved,
the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. 

Any
of these factors could adversely affect our foreign activities and our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The
risk of non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant
impact on our financial condition, results of operations and strategic objectives. 

Our
global operations subject us to regulation by U.S. federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws, regulations and policies, which
could result in conflicting legal requirements. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more
stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include import and export control, environmental,
health and safety regulations, data privacy requirements, international labor laws and work councils and anti-corruption and bribery
laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.N. Convention Against Bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments
to government officials. We are subject to the risk that we, our employees, our affiliated entities, contractors, agents or their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of any of these laws. An actual or alleged violation
could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations
in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely
affect our financial condition, results of operations and strategic objectives. 

In
addition, we are subject to Canadian and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public
Officials Act. In general, these laws prohibit a company and its employees and intermediaries from bribing or making other prohibited
payments to foreign officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We cannot predict
the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing
laws might be administered or interpreted. Failure by us or our predecessors to comply with the applicable legislation and other similar
foreign laws could expose us and our senior management to civil and/or criminal penalties, other sanctions and remedial measures, legal
expenses and reputational damage, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Likewise, any investigation of any alleged violations of the applicable anti-corruption legislation by Canadian or foreign
authorities could also have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

A
reversal of the U.S. economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the United States or abroad could adversely
affect our business or our access to capital markets in a material manner. 

Worsening
economic and market conditions, downside shocks, or a return to recessionary economic conditions could serve to reduce demand for our
products and adversely affect our operating results. These economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more
of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure product to meet our customers demand. In addition, a downturn in
the cinema market could impact the valuation and collectability of certain receivables held by us. Our results of operations and the
implementation of our business strategy could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including financial
and economic conditions that are outside of our control, including those resulting from supply chain delays or interruptions, labor shortages,
wage pressures, rising inflation, geopolitical events, or interruptions and other force majeure events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
The most recent global financial crisis caused by COVID-19 resulted in extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.
A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business and could have a material adverse effect on
us. We could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions
in each of the countries in which we sell our products. 

52 

Any
potential future acquisitions, strategic investments, entry into new lines of business, divestitures, mergers or joint ventures may subject
us to significant risks, any of which could harm our business. 

Our
long-term strategy may include identifying and acquiring, investing in or merging with suitable candidates on acceptable terms, entry
into new lines of business and markets or divesting of certain business lines or activities. In particular, over time, we may acquire,
make investments in or merge with providers of product offerings that complement our business or may terminate such activities. Mergers,
acquisitions, divestitures and entries into new lines of business include a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational
challenges, including but not limited to: 

diversion
 of management attention from running our existing business; 

possible
 material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting; 

increased
 expenses including legal, administrative and compensation expenses related to newly hired or terminated employees; 

increased
 costs to integrate, develop or, in the case of a divestiture, separate the technology, personnel, customer base and business practices
 of the acquired, new or divested business or assets; 

potential
 exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process; 

potential
 adverse effects on reported results of operations due to possible write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with
 acquisitions; 

potential
 damage to customer relationships or loss of synergies in the case of divestitures; and 

unavailability
 of acquisition financing or inability to obtain such financing on reasonable terms. 

Any
acquired business, technology, service or product, or entry into a new line of business could significantly under-perform relative to
our expectations and may not achieve the benefits we expect. For all these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, new line
of business, divestiture, merger or joint venture could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. 

Failure
to effectively utilize or successfully assert intellectual property rights could negatively impact us. 

We
own or otherwise have rights to various trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with the sale of our products, the most significant
of which is Strong . We rely on trademark laws to protect these intellectual property rights. We cannot assure that these intellectual
property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain
and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license from others, intellectual property rights necessary
to support new product introductions. Our intellectual property rights, and any additional rights we may obtain in the future, may be
invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could
harm our competitive position and could negatively impact us. 

53 

Natural
disasters and other catastrophic events beyond our control could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. 

The
occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as fires, hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes, geo-political events,
such as civil unrest in a country in which our suppliers are located or terrorist or military activities disrupting transportation, communication
or utility systems, or other highly disruptive events, such as nuclear accidents, public health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19
pandemic, unusual weather conditions or cyber-attacks, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. In the event
of a major disruption caused by the occurrence of any of the aforementioned events, we may lose the services of our employees or experience
system interruptions, which could lead to diminishment of our business operations. Such events could result, among other things, in operational
disruptions, physical damage to or destruction or disruption of one or more of our properties or properties used by third parties in
connection with the supply of products or services to us, the lack of an adequate workforce in parts or all of our operations and communications
and transportation disruptions. We cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current global health crisis and financial market conditions
could adversely impact our business. These factors could also cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased
volatility in the United States and global financial markets and economy. Such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us
and could also have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property
or other insurable damage. 

The
insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures. 

We
maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards
of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one
or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely
impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums
may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.
