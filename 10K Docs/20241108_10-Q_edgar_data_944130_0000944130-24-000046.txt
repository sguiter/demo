The CARES Act provides tax relief, along with other stimulus measures, including a provision for an Employee Retention Credit ERC ), which allows for employers to claim a refundable tax credit against the employer share of Social Security tax equal to 70 of the qualified wages paid to employees after December 31, 2020 through September 30, 2021 up to a maximum quarterly credit of 7,000 per employee. Employers are eligible for the credit if they experienced full or partial suspension or modification of operations during any calendar quarter because of governmental orders due to the pandemic, or a significant decline in gross receipts based on a comparison of quarterly revenue results for 2020 and/or 2021 with the comparable quarter in 2019. The statute of limitations on applying for the ERC is five years. As there is no authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP on accounting for government assistance to for-profit business entities, we account for the ERC by analogy to International Accounting Standard ("IAS") 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. In accordance with IAS 20, management determined it has reasonable assurance for receipt of the ERC and recorded the ERC

 OVERVIEW Since interest rates influence the Company s net interest margin, we monitor the national and global economies to evaluate their impact on our operations. We adjust the rates we charge on new loans we originate as well as the rate we pay on the debt securities we offer in response to market interest rate changes. We therefore keep a close eye on the FRB s monetary policy to manage inflation. Inflation became a concern for the FRB beginning in 2021 as it outpaced the FRB s target rate of 2 . In response, the FRB increased rates 525 basis points, raising them from 0.25 on January 1, 2022 to 5.50 as of their last rate hike in July 2023. This quarter, however, the FRB reduced the target rate by 50 basis points to 5.00 . Looking ahead, the FRB's median projection for the fed funds rate at the end of 2024 decreased to 4.4 from 5.1 as of their June projection. This may indicate that there could be a further decrease in the Fed Funds rate by year end. Management continues to carefully monitor the FRB s inflation fighting strategy as we seek to improve the net interest margin on our interest earning investments. An inverted yield curve with higher short-term rates than long-term rates can also adversely affect our net interest margin and profitability. The Company carefully monitors liquidity trends affecting U.S. financial institutions. Management has seen liquidity tighten at financial institutions in the last several years as funds injected into the financial system during the height of the COVID pandemic get depleted. For all FDIC insured institutions the liquidity ratio has decreased 12.31 from 37.55 as of September 30, 2021, to 25.24 as of June 30, 2024. 37.55 was the highest the liquidity ratio has been since 1984 while the average over that time was 24 . These statistics underscore the significant shift in liquidity dynamics within the banking sector, prompting the Company to remain vigilant in its monitoring efforts.

 Trends and Strategic Objectives For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, Company management has identified the following key trends and strategic objectives: Current Strategy. In 2020, the holder of the Company s term-debt presented the Company s Management with the opportunity to pay off the debt at a discount. Management evaluated the proposal and created a two-phase strategy to take advantage of the significant gains we would receive on the discounted pay off. Our phase one strategy focused on raising funds to pay off the debt by selling loan participations, allowing lower credit quality loans to pay off, and through the sale of our debt securities. We were able to do this between the years 2020 and 2022 and, during that period, we generated 7.2 million in revenue from gains on debt extinguishment. However, we knew the result of this strategy would be a smaller balance sheet due to reduced loan balances and cash. Consequently, future earnings would decrease once we repaid the debt. Therefore, our phase two strategy focused on regrowing the balance sheet and increasing the profitability of core operations by increasing non-interest income as well as reducing operating expenses. During the transition from phase one to phase two of the strategy, management planned for lower revenue and potential losses. We evaluated the benefits of the term-debt extinguishment and determined that the benefits outweighed having lower income between the end of phase one and the completion of phase two. The benefits of this strategy are: 
 1. 7.2 million in additional revenue. If we were earning a 2 spread on the approximate 70 million we invested in loans that were funded by the term-debt, it would take over five years to earn 7.2 million. We were able to earn the 7.2 million risk-free (no credit risk on the investment) in less than three years. 2. Significantly improved capital ratios. The revenue from the debt extinguishment created higher capital ratios for the Company. Our capital ratio doubled, increasing from 7.0 in 2019 to 14.7 in 2022. Capital provides protection for investors against losses as losses deplete capital first. 3. Improved loan credit quality . One way we funded the term-debt payoff was by allowing lower credit quality loans to pay off. These loans were able to secure financing from other sources which, in turn, strengthened our remaining loan portfolio. 

 5 

Table of Contents 
 4. Deleveraged balance sheet . The term-debt was secured by a portion of our loan portfolio. Now that it has been paid off, our investors are no longer subordinated to the claims of the term-debt holder. 
 We are currently transitioning to phase two and are working on improving the core profitability of the business. We are accomplishing this by making profitable loans, increasing our non-interest income, and reducing our operating expenses. We generate non-interest income through MP Securities who performs broker dealer and investment advisory services for our clients. We also generate non-interest income through originating loans and selling participation interests in those loans. Selling loan participations generates additional servicing fee income for the Company as well as gains on loan sales. This activity can also increase interest income on our loans as we recognize origination income on loans that we sell to participants. If the loan is not sold, the origination income is amortized over the life of the loan using the interest method. During the remainder of 2024, the Company intends to continue to focus on the following objectives: 
 (i) Investing in and growing our commercial loan investments through loan originations and cooperative efforts with our strategic partners to increase the commercial loans we make to non-profit organizations and faith-based borrowers; (ii) Sell participation interests in the loans the Company originates to increase non-interest revenue: 
 (ii) Continuing our efforts to reduce non-interest expenses by reducing overhead expense; (iii) Increasing the sale of our debt certificates to finance the growth in the Company s balance sheet; (iv) Effectively managing pressure on the Company s net interest margin due to an inverted yield curve in financial markets that results in higher short-term costs on our debt certificates while the Company makes longer term investments with the commercial loans it originates; and (v) Continuously expanding the revenues earned by the investment advisory, broker-dealer, and insurance operations at Ministry Partners Securities, LLC.

 Current Trends. For the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024, the Company has identified the following key trends: 

Improve Interest Income on Loan Investments. As detailed above, after paying off the debt facility, the next phase of our strategy was to regrow our loan portfolio, which we began in 2023. As shown in the chart below, we have successfully begun the implementation of this plan as we had six straight quarters of quarter over quarter growth. Q3 saw a decrease of 39 thousand in loan interest income; however, this was mostly due to a recapture of principal variance of 34 thousand that occurred in the second quarter that did not occur in the third quarter of 2024. The loan interest income earned for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 389 thousand higher than the quarter ended March 31, 2023, when we first implemented the growth phase of our strategy. Building the Company s Capital. A key initiative of our debt reduction strategy was improving the Company s capital ratio. When the Company commenced its debt reduction strategy in August 2020, its total net equity was 11.1 million. After the debt reduction, the Company s capitalization and total members equity reached its pinnacle on December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s total equity is 12.3 million. During this time (2020 through the report date) the Company was not only able to grow its capital base but was also able to distribute over 2 million to our equity owners through dividend payments. Company management s purposeful strategy to eliminate the Company s long-term debt has strengthened our capitalization and our net equity, has provided our investors with a stronger financial position that supports our debt certificates program, and has benefited our owners (who have capitalized the Company) through significant dividend payments.

Table of Contents 
 Improving Core Business Profitability. As noted above, we have begun to rebuild our loan portfolio. As a result, we have grown our quarter over quarter loan interest income for six of the last seven quarters. This growth is mostly due to the increase in loans receivable and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the interest rates of existing adjustable rate loans. 
 In addition, we have focused on improving our income through originating and selling loan participations as well as continuing to produce income from the operations of our broker-dealer and investment advisor subsidiary, MP Securities. Originating and selling loan participations allows the Company to generate loan origination income and gains on loan sales while deploying less cash than if we retained the whole loan on our books. We are also improving our core business profitability by focusing on expense reductions that will allow us to operate as a leaner and more efficient organization, while at the same time maintaining or improving our service level to our customers. We are observing positive outcomes from our efforts to enhance core profitability with the growth in loan interest described above. 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a net loss of 384 thousand. By comparison, during the same period in 2023, we recorded a net income of 406 thousand. Despite the net loss in 2024, our core profitability improved by 695 thousand over the same period. This improvement is because our first nine month results for 2023 included 1.7 million in non-recurring charitable gifts, which are not part of our ongoing core income (refer to the chart below). As described in the Notes to Financial Statements, Note 6, Revenue Recognition , in Q3 2024, we recorded non-recurring income of 215 thousand from ERC income. We do not anticipate receiving charitable gift income in 2024 or any additional ERC income going forward. We believe that our core operations (excluding large one-time income events) will begin to operate profitably within the next few quarters, which will complete phase two of the strategy.

We plan to rely on the sale of our debt certificates to fund the growth of our on-book loan portfolio, and from time to time may supplement that growth by utilizing our lines of credit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, assets decreased (6 due to total liabilities decreasing by 6.4 million. This was due to a reduction in our debt certificates payable of 2 million and a decrease in our lines of credit outstanding of 4.5 million. The Company

Table of Contents 
 funded most of the line of credit paydown by withdrawing 3 million in capital from its wholly owned subsidiary, MP Securities. Paying down the line of credit will improve our net interest income due to the high cost of the line of credit. Our loans receivable portfolio decreased by 4.2 million. During the first nine months of 2024, we had loan fundings of 7.7 million and sold 6.6 million in participation interests while we received another 5.7 million in loan principal payments. Our net loans receivable portfolio increased 1 million compared to the period ended September 30, 2023. As described earlier, selling participation interests in our loans allows us to manage our cash flow and recognize origination fees on the participation interests at the time of sale. Allowance for Expected Credit Losses The allowance decreased by 426 thousand. The individually reviewed portion of the allowance decreased by 236 thousand, which was due to the payoff of a loan with a specific allowance. 220 thousand was charged off on this loan. The collectively reviewed allowance decreased by 190 thousand. The decrease in the collectively reviewed allowance was due to a decrease in the charges related to a qualitive risk factor. The qualitative risk factor decreased as the Company reduced its concentration in loans that carried relatively high loan-to-value ratios. Debt Certificates Payable Our debt certificates payable comprise debt securities sold under publicly registered security offerings as well as promissory notes sold in private placement offerings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net debt certificates payable decreased by 2 million. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we increase our debt certificates payable by 2.9 million. Compared to the period ended September 30, 2023, debt certificates payable decreased by 92 thousand mostly due to higher debt issuance costs. The year-to-date decrease is attributable to the maturity of a few larger investments in the first two quarters that were not reinvested in a new certificate as the investors needed their cash for other projects. Management continues to engage in marketing and relationship-building efforts to further grow our unsecured debt to fund ministry loans. Over the last several years, we have expanded our debt certificates program by building relationships with other faith-based organizations whereby we can offer our various debt certificate products to these organizations and the ministries they serve. Concurrently, MP Securities has continued to increase its retail customer base through client referrals and its networking agreements with key strategic partners.

 Members Equity Our total members equity decreased by 6 to 12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted in a capital to asset ratio of 11.2 . The decrease in members equity was attributable to a net loss of 384 thousand and dividends to members of 427 thousand.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Management Our management team regularly prepares cash flow forecasts that we rely upon to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to conduct our business. While we believe that these expected cash inflows and outflows are reasonable, we can give no assurances that our forecasts or assumptions will prove to be correct. Management believes that we hold adequate sources of liquidity to meet our liquidity needs and have the means to generate more liquidity if necessary. As September 30, 2024, our liquidity ratio was 11 . We use multiple tools to manage our liquidity. We have 15 million in lines of credit of which all 15 million is available for cash management as of September 30, 2024. We also sell participation interests in our loan portfolio. During the first nine months of 2024 we sold 6.6 million in loan participation interests. We also fund our liquidity by selling corporate debt certificates. During the first nine months of 2024, we sold 35.4 million in our fixed series and another 976 thousand in our variable series corporate debt. Additional information about our debt securities and credit facilities is presented below. Public and Privately offered Debt Securities The table below presents a schedule of our fixed series debt certificates maturing during the next year as compared with the fixed series debt certificates maturing after one year.

 We can draw up to 10 million on the revolving lines of credit. In addition, we can draw up to 5 million on the KCT Warehouse LOC to facilitate warehousing new loan originations. Each draw on the KCT Warehouse LOC needs to be paid down after 120 days. The ACCU secured borrowings comprise loan participation sales that are classified as secured borrowings and will pay down as the loans amortize. Debt Covenants Under our credit facility agreements and our debt certificates documents, we are obligated to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants. Failure to comply with our covenants could require all interest and principal to become due. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with our covenants on our debt certificates payable, KCT Warehouse LOC, KCT Operating LOC, and ACCU LOC.

 Results of Operations: September 30, 2024 The analysis below compares the Company s results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Historically, our earnings have primarily depended upon our net interest income. 
 Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we receive from our loans and cash on deposit interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our debt certificates and borrowings. Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets.

This was offset slightly by a volume variance on interest-earning accounts 

 17 

Table of Contents 
 with other financial institutions. The interest-earning loan volume variance is due to the growth of the loan portfolio as management executes its growth strategy. The weighted average rate of our loan portfolio increased in 2024 to 6.86 as of September 30, 2024, from 6.43 as of September 30, 2023, due to higher rates offering rates on our new loans. Offering rates are higher due to the Fed Funds Rate increases described earlier. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total interest expense increased mostly due to a rate variance on debt certificates. This was due to higher offering rates on the Company s debt certificates also related to the Fed Funds Rate increases described earlier. The variances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023, arise from the same factors as the variances for the three months. However, in addition, debt certificates payable and other debt had volume variances. The volume variance on debt certificates was due to a higher starting balance in 2024 over the starting balance in 2023, which created a higher average balance for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. In addition, the volume variance on other debt was due to the Company holding higher levels of other debt earlier in the year in order to help fund loan growth. Net interest income increased by 107 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the factors described above. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, net interest margin increased by 45 basis points. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin increased by 23 basis points and net interest income increased by 278 thousand due to the factors described above. These improvements in net interest margin position the Company to begin operating profitably with its core operations in the coming quarters.

 Net interest income after provision for expected credit losses increased by 111 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, over the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to the increase in net interest income described earlier. The increase in total non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as shown in the table above, was primarily due to 215 thousand in ERC revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we grew our broker-dealer commission revenue by 96 thousand this quarter compared to the quarter ended 12 months ago. The decrease in non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to 1.7 million in charitable gifts made to our non-profit foundation, MPC. These gifts are a non-recurring contribution made to MPC, and we do not expect to receive charitable contributions in 2024. The decrease in total non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as shown in the table above, was mostly due to lower salaries and benefits expense of 292 thousand. Salaries and benefits were lower in 2024 due to fewer staff as the Company did not replace job vacancies and outsourced its loan servicing beginning in the second quarter of 2023. We also reduced office occupancy expenses by 34 , or 48 thousand, as we downsized our corporate headquarters in the beginning of 2024. These expense reductions were partially offset by an increase of 103 thousand in consulting expenses paid to our former CEO, Joseph Turner, for services provided to the Board of Managers.
