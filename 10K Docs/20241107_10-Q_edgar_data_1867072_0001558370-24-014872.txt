Japan: This reportable segment is comprised of Kyndryl s operations in Japan. Principal Markets: This reportable segment represents the aggregation of our operations in Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain / Portugal, and the United Kingdom / Ireland. Strategic Markets: This reportable segment is comprised of our operations in all other countries in which we operate. The Company made a minor change to its geographic reportable segments effective June 1, 2024 to reflect how the Company manages its operations and measures business performance, transitioning the reporting and management of its operations in Australia/New Zealand from the Principal Markets segment to the Strategic Markets segment. All historical segment information has been recast to reflect this change. The measure of segment operating performance used by Kyndryl s CODM is adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation of right-of-use assets and amortization of capitalized contract costs), charges related to ceasing to use leased and owned fixed assets, charges related to lease terminations, transaction-related costs, pension expenses other than pension servicing costs and multi-employer plan costs, stock-based compensation expense, workforce rebalancing charges incurred prior to March 31, 2024, impairment expense, significant litigation costs and benefits, and

The Company s negative effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the six months ended September 30, 2023 reflect a tax expense on a pretax book loss in those periods. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the six months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the Company s statutory tax rate, and its effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the Company s statutory tax rate, primarily due to taxes on foreign operations and valuation allowances recorded in certain jurisdictions against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. t declare any dividends in the periods presented.

The gross balances of derivative liabilities are contained within other accrued expenses and liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company may enter into master netting agreements with certain counterparties that allow for netting of exposures. There was netting of derivative assets against liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. The Company manages counterparty risk by seeking counterparties of high credit quality and by monitoring credit ratings, credit spreads and other relevant public information about its counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value Accounts receivable are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for short-term debt, which would be classified as Level 2. The Company also has time deposits that have maturities of 90 days or less, and their carrying values approximate fair value. They are measured for impairment on a recurring basis by comparing their fair value with their amortized cost basis. There were impairments of financial assets recognized for any of the periods presented. The balances of these time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less contained within cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 were million and million, respectively. If measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements, time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less would be categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our outstanding debt (excluding finance lease obligations) is based on various methodologies, including quoted prices in active markets for identical debt instruments, which is a Level 1 measurement, or calculated fair value using an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the Company for debt in active markets with similar terms and remaining maturities, which is a Level 2 measurement. See Note 10 Borrowings for additional information. Our outstanding debt (excluding finance lease obligations) had a carrying value of billion as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, with an estimated fair value of billion as of September 30, 2024 and billion as of March 31, 2024.

The fees associated with the transfers of receivables were million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments The following table summarizes the notional amounts of the Company s outstanding derivatives: Net investment hedges Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments The notional amounts of derivative instruments do not necessarily represent the amounts exchanged by the Company with third parties and are not necessarily a direct measure of the financial exposure. Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Cash Flow Hedges The Company has foreign exchange derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage the volatility of cash flows that relate to operating expenses denominated in certain currencies. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded, net of applicable taxes, in other comprehensive income OCI and subsequently reclassified into the same income statement line item as the hedged exposure when the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. The cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are reported in cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The maximum remaining length of time over which the Company hedged its exposure is approximately . At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately years. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency cost transactions, the Company had unrealized losses of million and unrealized gains of million (each before taxes), respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI ). The Company estimates that million (before taxes) of net deferred losses on derivatives in AOCI at September 30, 2024 will be reclassified to net income within the next twelve months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.

 . At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining maturity of the Company s net investment hedge instruments was approximately and , respectively. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had unrealized losses of million and million (each before taxes), respectively, in AOCI related to net investment hedges. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The Company enters into currency forward and swap contracts to hedge exposures related to assets, liabilities and earnings across its subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, and therefore changes in fair value of these contracts are reported in earnings in other expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. The gains and losses on these contracts generally offset the gains and losses in the underlying hedged exposures, which are also reported in other expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The terms of these swap contracts are generally less than .

 million, net of cash acquired of million. Costs associated with this acquisition were approximately million and are expensed as incurred within transaction-related costs within the accompanying Consolidated Income Statement. Pro forma financial information has not been presented, as revenue and expenses related to the acquisition do not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquisition of Skytap expands the Company s hybrid cloud services portfolio. The purchase price allocation resulted in approximately million in intangible assets, primarily consisting of million in completed technologies and million in customer relationships with estimated useful lives of five and , respectively, assets transferred of million (inclusive of cash acquired of million), liabilities assumed of million, and goodwill of million, primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from this acquisition. We do not expect the goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company made immaterial adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation impacting the valuation of goodwill and assets transferred. The purchase price allocation for this acquisition is preliminary, and there may be further changes in the allocation of consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets and goodwill, for up to twelve months from the acquisition date. Disposal of the Securities Industry Services SIS Business In the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its transaction processing platform for the securities brokerage industry services in Canada (which is a component of the Company s Principal Markets segment), known as SIS , for approximately million in cash. The Company classifies assets and liabilities as held for sale in the period when all the relevant classification criteria have been met. Assets and liabilities held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Losses (if any) resulting from the measurement are recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains from a disposal group are not recognized until the date of sale. The fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, will be reassessed during each subsequent reporting period it remains classified as held for sale, and any subsequent changes will be reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group until it is no longer classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciation and amortization of the related assets and liabilities. The Company classified the assets and liabilities related to SIS as held for sale in the three months ended June 30, 2024 within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other accrued expenses and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This disposition is not accounted for as discontinued operations as it does not meet the relevant criteria. The carrying value of the net assets being sold is not material.

 Amounts include effects from foreign currency translation. The net carrying amount of intangible assets increased by million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Skytap and capitalized software added during the period, partially offset by amortization. The aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. This included amortization of capitalized software of million and million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, which was reported in Depreciation of property, equipment and capitalized software on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, the Company retired approximately million of fully amortized intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships. The future amortization expense relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet was estimated to be the following at September 30, 2024: 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter

 These amounts represent the goodwill acquired as part of the purchase of Skytap, in addition to the allocation of goodwill to assets held for sale related to the divestiture of the SIS business using the relative fair value approach. See Note 8 Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional details. As discussed in Note 4 Segments, Kyndryl s operations in Australia/New Zealand transitioned from the Principal Markets segment to the Strategic Markets segment in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. As a result, the Company reallocated the goodwill associated with Australia/New Zealand from the Principal Markets segment to the Strategic Markets segment. The Company also performed a qualitative impairment test immediately before and after the change in reporting units and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying amounts, including goodwill. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the goodwill related to those reporting units was not impaired. There were goodwill impairment losses recorded for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Management reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable by first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value.

 million in direct damages and million in punitive damages, plus interest, for which IBM might have tried to seek an indemnity from the Company. However, IBM appealed the judgment, and in April 2024, the court of appeals overturned the judgment against IBM. Accordingly, we do not expect to have any liability related to this judgment. Separately, certain contractual disputes have arisen between Kyndryl and IBM following the Separation. IBM and Kyndryl have commenced arbitration proceedings related to certain of these matters. Certain of these matters have recently been concluded, resulting in a credit recorded in Cost of services in the six months ended September 30, 2024, while others are in preliminary stages. Kyndryl intends to vigorously pursue its interests and defenses in these matters, including asserting its own claims in arbitration if necessary.

The Company expects that these actions will reduce future payroll costs, rent expenses and depreciation of property and equipment. During the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company initiated actions to reduce our overall cost structure and increase our operating efficiency, which continued through the year ended March 31, 2024. These actions resulted in workforce rebalancing charges, charges related to ceasing to use leased and owned fixed assets, and lease termination charges (collectively, the Fiscal 2024 Program ). The total charges incurred related to the Fiscal 2024 Program were approximately million, consisting of million in workforce rebalancing charges and million in charges related to ceasing to use leased and owned fixed assets and lease termination charges.

On November 3, 2021, Kyndryl separated from IBM through a spin-off that was tax-free for U.S. federal tax purposes. Following the Separation, Kyndryl became an independent, publicly-traded company and the world s leading IT infrastructure services provider. Financial Performance Summary Macro Dynamics In fiscal year 2025, we have seen continuing demand for information technology services, despite concerns about economic growth and geopolitical tensions. Most economists, including the International Monetary Fund, expect positive macroeconomic growth to continue in calendar years 2024 and 2025. Financial Performance For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported 3.8 billion in revenue, a decline of 7 percent compared to the prior-year period. The revenue decline was largely attributable to actions the Company has taken to reduce low-margin components of its customer relationships. United States revenue declined 13 percent, Japan revenue increased 6 percent, Principal Markets revenue declined 4 percent and Strategic Markets revenue decreased 12 percent, in each case compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss of 43 million improved by 99 million versus the prior-year period driven by a combination of lower depreciation expenses resulting from the change of useful life of information technology equipment effective April 1, 2024 (a net year-over-year benefit of 50 million), lower transaction-related costs, and progress on our key initiatives to drive operating efficiencies and increased margins, partially offset by increased software costs.

Table of Contents Management Discussion (continued) 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we reported 7.5 billion in revenue, a decline of 9 percent compared to the prior-year period. The revenue decline was largely attributable to actions the Company has taken to reduce low-margin components of its customer relationships, as well as currency effects. United States revenue declined 14 percent, Japan revenue was unchanged (but increased in constant currency), Principal Markets revenue declined 5 percent and Strategic Markets revenue decreased 14 percent, in each case compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss of 32 million improved by 251 million versus the prior-year period driven by a combination of lower depreciation expenses resulting from the change of useful life of information technology equipment effective April 1, 2024 (a net year-over-year benefit of 110 million), lower transaction-related costs, progress on our key initiatives to drive operating efficiencies and increased margins, and a vendor credit, partially offset by increased software costs. Segment Results The Company made a minor change to its geographic reportable segments effective June 1, 2024 to reflect how the Company manages its operations and measures business performance, transitioning the reporting and management of its operations in Australia/New Zealand from the Principal Markets segment to the Strategic Markets segment. All historical segment information has been recast to reflect this change. The following table presents our reportable segments revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Segment revenue and revenue growth in constant currency exclude any transactions between the segments.

 NM not meaningful (1) Revenue growth in constant currency and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial metrics. See the information below for definitions of these metrics and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). (2) Represents net amounts not allocated to segments. We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also present certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide useful supplemental information to investors. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures as we believe it enhances visibility to underlying results and the impact of management decisions on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies and allows us to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. Revenue growth in constant currency is a non-GAAP measure that eliminates the effects of exchange rate fluctuations when translating from foreign currencies to the United States dollar. It is calculated by using the average exchange rates that existed for the same period of the prior year. Constant-currency measures are provided so that

Table of Contents Management Discussion (continued) 
 revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. Additionally, management uses adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and defined as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation of right-of-use assets and amortization of capitalized contract costs), charges related to ceasing to use leased/fixed assets, charges related to lease terminations, transaction-related costs, pension expenses other than pension servicing costs and multi-employer plan costs, stock-based compensation expense, workforce rebalancing charges incurred prior to March 31, 2024, impairment expense, significant litigation costs and benefits, and currency impacts of highly inflationary countries. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a helpful supplemental measure to assist investors in evaluating our operating results as it excludes certain items whose fluctuation from period to period does not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business. These disclosures are provided in addition to and not as a substitute for the percentage change in revenue and profit or loss measures on a U.S. GAAP basis compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. The following table provides a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA:

 Other adjustments represent pension expenses other than pension servicing costs and multi-employer plan costs, significant litigation costs and benefits, and currency impacts of highly inflationary countries. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, other adjustments also include an adjustment to reduce amortization expense for the amount already included in transaction-related costs above.

Other expense was 0.6 of revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.2 in the prior-year period, driven by currency-related hedging losses recorded this year. Transaction-Related Costs The Company classifies certain expenses and benefits related to the Separation, acquisitions and divestitures (if any) as transaction-related costs in the Consolidated Income Statement. Transaction-related costs include employee retention expenses, information technology costs, marketing expenses to establish the Kyndryl brand, legal, accounting, consulting and other professional service costs required, pre-Separation and post-Separation, to prepare for and execute the Separation, costs and benefits resulting from settlements with our former Parent associated with pre-Separation and Separation-related matters, and other costs related to contract and supplier novation and integration. Workforce Rebalancing and Site-Rationalization Charges Fiscal 2025 Program During the six months ended September 30, 2024, management initiated actions to reduce the Company s overall cost structure and increase our operating efficiency. These actions will result in workforce rebalancing charges, charges related to ceasing to use leased and owned fixed assets, and charges related to lease terminations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 39 million in workforce rebalancing charges and 10 million in charges related to ceasing to use leased and owned fixed assets including lease termination charges. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 74 million in workforce rebalancing charges and 20 million in charges related to ceasing to use leased and owned fixed assets, including lease termination charges. Total cash outlays for this program are expected to be 140 million, of which approximately 60 million has been paid through September 30, 2024 and approximately 50 million is expected to be paid through the end of fiscal year 2025, and the remainder thereafter. Management expects that these workforce rebalancing and site-rationalization activities will reduce payroll costs, rent expenses and depreciation of property and equipment by more than 200 million in fiscal year 2026. There can be no guarantee that we will achieve our expected cost savings. The Company will continue to seek opportunities to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, which may result in additional charges in future periods. For additional information, see Note 14 Workforce Rebalancing and Site-Rationalization Charges in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Fiscal 2024 Program During the year ended March 31, 2023, management initiated certain actions to reduce the Company s overall cost structure and increase our operating efficiency, which continued through the year ended March 31, 2024. These actions resulted in workforce rebalancing charges, charges related to ceasing to use leased and owned fixed assets, and charges related to lease terminations. Workforce rebalancing charges arise from cost-reduction actions to enhance productivity and cost-competitiveness and to rebalance skills that result in payments to the terminated employees. In addition, we identified certain leased and owned assets that were inherited from IBM as a result of the Separation that we determined will no longer provide any economic benefit to Kyndryl. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized 39 million in workforce rebalancing charges. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized 97 million in workforce rebalancing charges and 10 million in charges related to ceasing to use leased and owned fixed assets and lease termination charges. Total cash outlays for this program were 300 million, of which approximately 250 million has been paid through September 30, 2024 (including approximately 50 million of contractual payments toward leased assets we have ceased to use) and approximately 15 million is expected to be paid in fiscal year 2025. Management estimates that these workforce rebalancing and site-rationalization activities will reduce payroll costs, rent expenses and depreciation of property and equipment by approximately 400 million in fiscal year 2025. There can be no guarantee that we will achieve our expected cost savings. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 38 million of expense, compared to 33 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to taxes on foreign operations and valuation allowances recorded in certain jurisdictions against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. The provision for income taxes for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 91 million of expense, compared to 65 million of expense for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Our income tax expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to taxes on foreign operations and valuation allowances recorded in certain jurisdictions against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and actions. Estimates of future taxable income and loss could change, perhaps materially, which may require us to revise our assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset at that time. Financial Position Dynamics Total assets of 10.4 billion decreased by 194 million (and decreased by 363 million adjusted for currency) from March 31, 2024, primarily driven by: a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 228 million mainly due to payments for annual license agreements and annual incentives; and a decrease of 158 million in accounts receivable mainly due to lower revenue; partially offset by an increase of 109 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets mainly due to prepayment for software subscriptions and currency effects. Total liabilities of 9.2 billion decreased by 244 million (and decreased by 375 million adjusted for currency) from March 31, 2024, primarily as a result of: a decrease in accounts payable of 168 million due to lower costs; a decrease in accrued contract costs of 83 million due to lower volumes; and a decrease in accrued compensation and 

 35 

Table of Contents Management Discussion (continued) 
 benefits of 71 million due to payments of annual incentives, partially offset by currency effects. Total equity of 1.2 billion increased by 50 million from March 31, 2024, principally due to our comprehensive income in the period. Cash Flow Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are summarized in the table below. 

Six Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 101 (127) Investing activities (241) (208) Financing activities (101) (80) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 17 (33) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (224) (448) Net cash provided by operating activities was 101 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net cash use of 127 million in the prior-year period mainly due to higher margins. Net cash used in investing activities was 241 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net cash use of 208 million in the prior-year period due to the acquisition of Skytap. Net cash used in financing activities totaled 101 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 80 million in the prior-year period. Other Information Signings The following table presents the Company s signings for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in billions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total signings 5.6 2.4 8.7 5.2 Signings increased by 3.2 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2024, or 132 , compared to the prior-year quarter, and signings increased by 3.5 billion in the six months ended September 30, 2024, or 67 , compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, driven by growth in each of our four operating segments. Management uses signings as a tool to monitor the performance of the business including the business ability to attract new customers and sell additional scope into our existing customer base. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. We define signings as an initial estimate of the value of a customer s commitment under a contract. The calculation involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a customer s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Signings can vary over time due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of signing a small number of larger outsourcing contracts as well as the length of those contracts. The conversion of signings into revenue may vary based on the types of services and solutions, customer decisions and other factors, which may include, but are not limited to, the macroeconomic environment or external events.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and the Company s revolving credit agreement entered into in October 2021 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Senior Unsecured Notes In October 2021, in preparation for our Spin-off, we completed the offering of 2.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed-rate notes as follows: 700 million aggregate principal amount of 2.05 Senior Notes due 2026, 500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.70 Senior Notes due 2028, 650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.15 Senior Notes due 2031 and 550 million aggregate principal amount of 4.10 Senior Notes due 2041 (the Initial Notes ). The Initial Notes were offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S of the Securities Act. In connection with the issuance of the Initial Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers of the Initial Notes, pursuant to which we completed a registered offering to exchange each series of Initial Notes for new notes with substantially identical terms during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. In February 2024, we completed a registered offering of 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.35 senior unsecured notes due 2034 (the 2034 Notes ). We received proceeds of 494 million, net of debt issuance costs and discounts. The 2034 Notes are the Company s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company s other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Initial Notes and the 2034 Notes are subject to customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default for financings of this type and are redeemable at our option in a customary manner. Revolving Credit Facility In October 2021, we entered into a 3.15 billion multi-currency revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement ), which expires, unless extended, in October 2026. The Revolving Credit Agreement was amended in June 2023, replacing the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). Interest rates on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will be based on prevailing market interest rates, plus a margin, as further described in the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there has been no drawdown on the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes certain customary mandatory prepayment provisions. In addition, it includes customary events of default and affirmative and negative covenants as well as a maintenance covenant that will require that the ratio of our indebtedness for borrowed money to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters be no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants. Transfers of Financial Assets The Company has entered into arrangements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain financial assets (primarily trade receivables) without recourse. The Company has determined these are true sales. The carrying value of the financial asset sold is derecognized, and a net gain or loss on the sale is recognized, at the time of the transfer. The first agreement, which was executed in November 2021 and subsequently amended, enabled us to sell certain of our trade receivables to the counterparty. The initial term of this agreement was 18 months, and the agreement automatically resets to a term of 18 months after every six months, unless either party elects not to extend. This agreement was further amended during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to reduce the committed facility limit from 1 billion to 600 million and to add an incremental uncommitted facility limit of 200 million that is subject to the counterparty s sole discretion to purchase such incremental amount. The second agreement was executed in June 2022 with a separate third-party financial institution and renews automatically on its anniversary date, unless either party elects not to extend.

 The net proceeds from these agreements are reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Gross proceeds from receivables sold to third parties under the aforementioned programs were 1.1 billion and 1.9 billion for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 913 million and 2.1 billion for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The fees associated with the transfers of receivables were 10 million and 20 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 12 million and 28 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Supplier Financing Program In the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company initiated a supplier financing program with a third-party financial institution under which the Company agrees to pay the financial institution the stated amounts of invoices from participating suppliers on the originally invoiced due date, which have an average term of 90 to 120 days. The financial institution offers earlier payment of the invoices at the sole discretion of the supplier for a discounted amount. The Company does not provide secured legal assets or other forms of guarantees under the arrangements. The Company is not a party to the arrangement between its suppliers and the financial institution. The Company or the financial institution may terminate the agreement upon at least 180 days notice. The Company s obligations under this program continue to be recognized as accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The obligations outstanding under this program were immaterial at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. Critical Accounting Estimates The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 for more information; we refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 as the Form 10-K .

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For our disclosures about market risk, see the information under the heading Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Form 10-K . There have been no material changes to the Company s disclosure about market risk in the Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures The Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in the area of our information technology general controls ITGCs that was disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of the Company s Form 10-K. The deficiencies in ITGCs were related to access and program development and change management controls associated with the Company s large-scale migration in a compressed timeframe of its internal operating systems to a new enterprise resource planning system, which was required to replace the systems temporarily being made available to the Company by our former Parent following our Spin-off. These control deficiencies did not result in a misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements previously filed or included in this Form 10-Q. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting other than the ongoing remediation of the ITGC deficiencies described below. Remediation The Company has substantially completed the design and implementation, and has begun testing the operating effectiveness, of controls to address ITGC deficiencies that were previously described in Part II, Item 9A of the Company s Form 10-K. These controls include but are not limited to (i) implementing and/or formalizing additional controls across our information technology environment, including user access and segregation of duty controls, program development and change management controls, and certain computer operations controls, and (ii) training of relevant personnel on the design and operation of any new or modified ITGCs. The deficiencies will not be considered fully remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. The remediation plan is subject to ongoing management review, as well as oversight by the Audit Committee of our Board.
