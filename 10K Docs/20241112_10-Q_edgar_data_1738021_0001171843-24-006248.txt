ABL Bio Corporation ("ABL Bio") Agreement 

In November 2018, the Company and ABL Bio, a South Korean biotechnology company, entered into an exclusive global (excluding South Korea) license agreement which granted the Company a license to CTX-009 (ABL001), ABL Bio s bispecific antibody targeting DLL4 and VEGF-A. Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies would jointly develop CTX-009, with ABL Bio responsible for development of CTX-009 throughout the end of Phase 1 clinical trials and the Company responsible for the development of CTX-009 from Phase 2 and onward. ABL Bio received a million upfront payment and million development milestone payment. In addition, ABL Bio is eligible to receive up to million of development and regulatory milestone payments, and up to million of commercial milestone payments and tiered single-digit royalties on net sales of CTX-009 in oncology. ABL Bio is also eligible to receive up to million in development and regulatory milestones and up to million in commercial milestone payments and tiered, single-digit royalties on net sales of CTX-009 in ophthalmology. 

In May 2021, the Company and ABL Bio terminated license agreements to several preclinical assets. As a result of the return of these assets to ABL Bio and termination of the license agreements, the Company is eligible to receive royalty payments if ABL Bio develops or licenses two bispecific antibodies that were previously licensed to the Company. 

Adimab Agreement 

The Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Adimab, LLC on October 16, 2014. The agreement includes provisions for payment of royalties at rates ranging in the single digits as a percentage of future net sales within a specified term from the first commercial sale for certain antibodies, including our product candidate, CTX-471.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Compass Therapeutics, Inc. should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions. You should read the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Risk Factors section included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 , for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 

Overview 

We are a clinical-stage, oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company developing proprietary antibody-based therapeutics to treat multiple human diseases. Our scientific focus is on the relationship between angiogenesis, the immune system, and tumor growth. Our pipeline of novel product candidates is designed to target multiple critical biological pathways required for an effective anti-tumor response. These include modulation of the microvasculature via angiogenesis-targeted agents, induction of a potent immune response via activators on effector cells in the tumor microenvironment, and alleviation of immunosuppressive mechanisms used by tumors to evade immune surveillance. We plan to advance our product candidates through clinical development as both standalone therapies and in combination with proprietary pipeline antibodies based on supportive clinical and nonclinical data. 

In September 2024, we signed a new lease on its existing facility extending the term six years to May 2031. 

In addition to our pre-clinical antibody candidates, we currently have three product candidates in the clinical stage of development: CTX-009, CTX-471 and CTX-8371. A summary of these product candidates is presented below. For a more detailed description, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

CTX-009 (a.k.a. ABL001) - anti-DLL4 x VEGF-A bispecific antibody 

CTX-009 is an investigational bispecific antibody that is designed to simultaneously block DLL4 and VEGF-A signaling pathways, which are critical to angiogenesis and tumor vascularization. Preclinical and early clinical data of CTX-009 as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy suggest that blockade of both pathways provides robust anti-tumor activity across several solid tumors, including colorectal, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. 

CTX-009 is currently undergoing clinical studies as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in the United States. We currently have two ongoing U.S. clinical trials with CTX-009: a Phase 2 trial of CTX-009 as monotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer CRC who received two or three prior treatment regimens (this trial, as discussed further below, is in the process of being discontinued) and a randomized Phase 2/3 trial of CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with biliary tract cancer BTC who received one prior treatment regimen. 

We licensed the exclusive global rights to CTX-009, outside of South Korea, from ABL Bio, Inc. ABL Bio ), a South Korea-based clinical-stage company focused on developing antibody therapeutics. South Korean rights are held by Handok Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Handok and China rights were out-licensed from the Company to Elpiscience Biopharmaceuticals Co., Limited Elpiscience ). 

Our strategy is to develop CTX-009 in all of the indications in which patients have a need for effective and novel therapeutic agents and data supports the potential therapeutic benefit of CTX-009. We chose BTC and CRC as our lead indications based on a number of factors, including CTX-009 activity observed in the Phase 1, 1b and 2 clinical trials, lack of effective therapies for these patient populations in the targeted lines of therapy and the potential for a straight-forward regulatory route to approval. 

12

We have completed the first stage of a Simon Two-Stage adaptive Phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial of CTX-009 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have received two or three prior systemic therapies irrespective of their KRAS mutation status. We are not, however, advancing to the second stage because the first stage did not achieve the pre-determined response criteria for advancement. The trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of CTX-009 as a monotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer treated in the third and fourth-line settings. The trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT 05513742). 

The first stage of the trial enrolled 41 patients in the United States, of which 26 (63 were treated in the fourth line. As of August 2024, preliminary data associated with the first stage of this trial are as follows: overall response rate ORR of 5 (2 out of 41), the disease control rate DCR of 71 (29 out of 41), median progression free survival PFS of 3.9 months and median overall survival OS is currently 10.2 months. The safety profile was consistent with the prior clinical trials with hypertension as the most common adverse event. Based on the data from the first stage, we are discontinuing the current Phase 2 monotherapy trial and planning to initiate a new second-line trial in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer combined with chemotherapy whose tumors express DLL4 in mid-2025. 

We are also conducting a randomized Phase 2/3 trial for CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel in adult patients with unresectable, advanced, metastatic or recurrent biliary tract cancers BTC or cholangiocarcinoma who have received one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen. The trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of CTX-009 and paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone in patients treated in the second-line settings. The trial is designed to enroll 150 patients, who will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive CTX-009 plus paclitaxel (n=100) or paclitaxel alone (n=50). The primary endpoint of the trial is overall response rate ORR and the secondary endpoints include PFS, DCR, duration of response DOR and OS. This trial was fully enrolled in August 2024 and top line data from this study is expected at the end of the first quarter of 2025. The trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier NCT 05506943). In April 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track Designation to CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced BTC that have been previously treated. 

We also recently approved the initiation of an Investigator Sponsored Trial IST for the study of CTX-009 in the first-line setting in patients with BTC to be conducted at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. This study is expected to be open in the fourth quarter of 2024. The trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier NCT 06548412). 

We intend to explore the potential of CTX-009 in additional indications based on data from pre-clinical models, potential biomarkers such as DLL4, and clinical data from CTX-009 trials providing signs of potential activity of CTX-009. Additional indications may include ovarian cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cell cancer, neuroendocrine cancer and others. 

In addition, we are developing a plan to study the combination of CTX-009 with bispecific checkpoint blockers, including our CTX-8371, as well as combining with our novel CD137 agonistic antibody, CTX-471, which is currently in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. 

CTX-471 - a monoclonal antibody agonist of CD137 (4-1BB) 

CTX-471, our monoclonal antibody product candidate, is a fully human, IgG4 monoclonal antibody that is an agonist of CD137, a key co-stimulatory receptor on immune cells. Binding of CTX-471 to CD137 has been observed to lead to ligand-stimulated activation of T-cells and NK cells. In treated mice, dosing with CTX-471 led to extensive reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment, including increased recruitment of immune cells, reversion of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, reductions in immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells and reductions in immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages. Long after the completion of the treatment with CTX-471, a period described as eight half-lives of the antibody, treated mice exhibited immune memory that prevented re-establishment of the same tumor. 

In the Phase 1b monotherapy study, CTX-471 was evaluated in patients with solid tumors that had progressed after at least three months on an approved PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Initial results reported from the study included five clinical responses, including a durable partial response PR in a patient with small-cell lung cancer that converted to a complete response (as confirmed by PET scan) and four additional PRs (one unconfirmed) in patients with melanoma and mesothelioma. The ORR in the subset of patients with advanced melanoma was 27 (3 of 11). Data were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2024.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a clinical trial in collaboration with Merck Co. Merck , known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) to evaluate CTX-471 in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Compass is the study sponsor and Merck provides the clinical supply of KEYTRUDA . Prior to completing enrollment of this trial, we observed an unexpected suppression of proinflammatory cytokines that was not observed with CTX-471 as a monotherapy. In the second quarter of 2024, we reported that the combination study will be discontinued. 

In November 2024, we presented novel biomarker data for CTX-471 at the 39th Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting. Our research showed a correlation between the levels of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM or CD56) in baseline tumor cell biopsies and disease control in patients treated with CTX-471. To measure pharmacodynamic effects, comparisons were made between pre- and post-CTX-471 treatment. To survey response biomarkers, values from baseline samples obtained from patients with tumors showing complete or partial responses as well as stable disease were compared with tumors showing progressive disease. We hypothesize that NCAM facilitates responses to CTX-471 by enriching for activated NK cells expressing the CTX-471 target, CD137. The dataset shows these effects to be specific for NCAM expressing lymphocytes such as NK cells and is not observed in other lymphocyte subsets such as CD8 T cells. These findings are novel in a clinical setting and support potential use of NCAM as a selection marker. The company is currently evaluating the design for its next study of CTX-471 using NCAM as a biomarker, which it expects to initiate in mid-2025. 

CTX-8371 - a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets both PD-1 and PD-L1 

CTX-8371 is a bispecific antibody that binds to both PD-1 and PD-L1, the targets of well-known and widely used checkpoint inhibitor antibodies and in addition acts via differentiated mechanism-of-action that involves cleavage of cell surface PD-1. Preclinical studies demonstrate that CTX-8371 has the ability to outperform PD-1, PD-L1, and combinations of the two to activate T-cells in in vitro assays. In mouse xenografts, treatment with CTX-8371 led to significantly greater tumor growth control and longer survival than treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor alone, a PD-L1 inhibitor alone or the combination of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. 

An IND was accepted and cleared by the FDA in October 2023 and the first patient was dosed in April 2024. As of October 2024, the second cohort of this trial was completed with no dose limiting toxicities observed. We plan to initiate the third cohort by the end of 2024. 

OPERATING ACTIVITIES 

We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. Through September 30, 2024, we have received 430 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity securities. 

We have incurred significant operating losses since inception and have not generated any revenue from the sale of products and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our treatments and any future product candidates. Our net losses were 10.5 million and 10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net losses were 34.3 million and 29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of 350 million on September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for at least the next couple of years as we advance through clinical development, develop additional product candidates and seek regulatory approval of any product candidates that complete clinical development. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. We may also incur expenses in connection with the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates. 

Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through equity and debt financings, or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. As of September 30, 2024, we had 135 million in cash and marketable securities. We expect that such cash resources will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2027. 

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Components of Results of Operations 

Licensing Revenue 

Licensing revenue consists of a milestone payment received from a license agreement with Elpiscience Biopharmaceuticals Co., Limited Elpiscience for CTX-009 in China. The revenue is shown net of a royalty due on the licensing revenue as it is not material to the statement of operations. See note 11 of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the license agreement. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates, CTX-471, CTX-8371 and CTX-009. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include: 

employee-related expenses including salaries, related benefits and equity-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

expenses incurred under agreements with organizations that support our platform program development; 

Contract Manufacturing Organizations CMO that are primarily engaged to provide drug substance and product for our clinical trials, research and development programs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, nonclinical studies and other scientific development services; 

the cost of acquiring and manufacturing nonclinical and clinical trial materials, including manufacturing registration and validation batches; 

costs related to compliance with quality and regulatory requirements; and 

facilities and equipment expenses. 

Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered. 

Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical development activities in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the clinical development of any future product candidates. 

The successful development and commercialization of product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax, insurance, administrative travel expenses, facilities related to administrative personnel and other operating costs. 

We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our business operations.

Other Income 

Other income consists of interest income on marketable securities.

Licensing Revenue 

Licensing revenue was 850 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was no licensing revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The licensing revenue consisted of a 1 million milestone payment from Elpiscience for completing a Phase 1 trial in China. This license revenue is reported net of a 15 sublicense royalty due ABL Bio (see note 11 of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on this sublicense agreement). 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses increased by 3.6 million, or 14 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a 5.3 million increase in clinical costs, primarily related to the COMPANION-002 trial (CTX-009 BTC), partially offset by 3.8 million less in manufacturing expense, primarily related to CTX-009. In addition, there was an additional 1.2 million of stock compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

We track outsourced development, personnel costs and other research and development costs of specific programs. Research and development expenses are summarized by program in the table below (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to organizing and staffing our Company, business planning, raising capital, research and development activities, building our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. Through September 30, 2024, we have received 430 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and marketable securities of 135 million. 

For the first nine months of 2024, we sold through our at-the-market ATM agreement with Jefferies LLC, 9,790,577 shares of common stock at an average price of 1.85 for total proceeds of 18.1 million and net proceeds of 17.6 million. 

Funding Requirements 

Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, primarily research and development expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 

the scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for marketing approval and commercialization; 

the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our product candidates; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

the costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies; 

our ability to establish additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; 

the costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities; 

the costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and 

revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval. 

18

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, current stockholders interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Operating Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 35.7 million of cash in operating activities, resulting from our net loss of 34.3 million minus the change in operating assets and liabilities of 7.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of 6.3 million (primarily from share-based compensation expense of 6.3 million). 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 28.3 million of cash in operating activities, resulting from our net loss of 29.1 million plus the change in operating assets and liabilities of 2.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of 3.5 million). 

Investing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 31.4 million of cash was provided by investing activities, related to the net sale of marketable securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 20.7 million of cash was provided by investing activities which primarily related to the net sale of marketable securities. 

Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 17.4 million of cash was provided by financing activities. This primarily included 17.6 million of net cash from sale of common stock under an ATM Agreement, after issuance costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 3.1 million of cash was provided by financing activities. This primarily included 3.0 million of net cash from sale of common stock under an ATM Agreement, after issuance costs. 

Future Funding Requirements 

We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on: 

the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop; 

the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies for our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop; 

19

our ability to maintain our relationships with key collaborators; 

the outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform more nonclinical studies or clinical trials than those that we currently expect or change their requirements on studies that had previously been agreed to; 

the cost to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patents or other intellectual property rights; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; 

the costs of continuing to grow our business, including hiring key personnel and maintain or acquiring operating space; 

market acceptance of any approved product candidates, including product pricing, as well as product coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement by third-party payors; 

the cost of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies; 

the cost and timing of selecting and validating a manufacturing site for commercial-scale manufacturing; and 

the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval and that we determine to commercialize. 

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2027 based on our current plans, which may change based on clinical or pre-clinical results. These plans include: A Phase 2/3 and two Phase 2 clinical trials of CTX-009, a Phase 2 trial for CTX-471 and a Phase 1a trial of CTX-8371. We expect that we will require additional funding to complete the clinical development of these three programs and commercialize our product candidates, if we receive regulatory approval. If we receive regulatory approval for CTX-009, CTX-471 or CTX-8371 or other product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on if and how we choose to commercialize these product candidates ourselves. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity and debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interest may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

(d) Landlord s failure to render or delay in rendering a Building Operating Expense statement, Laboratory Operating Expense statement or Tax expense statement with respect to any Operating Year or Tax Year shall not prejudice Landlord s right thereafter to render the same with respect thereto nor shall the rendering of a Building Operating Expense statement, Laboratory Operating Expense statement or Tax expense statement, as applicable, for any Operating Year or Tax Year, as applicable, prejudice Landlord s right thereafter to render a corrected Building Operating Expense statement, Laboratory Operating Expense statement or Tax expense statement, as applicable, for such Operating Year or Tax Year, as applicable, provided, however, that Landlord shall in all events render the Building Operating Expense statement, Laboratory Operating Expense statement or Tax expense statement, as applicable, in question or any corrections thereto within two (2) years after the end of the Operating Year or Tax Year, as applicable, covered by the applicable statement, and provided, further that the foregoing two (2) year period shall expressly not apply to any new or corrected Building Operating Expense statement, Laboratory Operating Expense statement or Tax expense statement, as applicable, rendered by Landlord to reflect charges or corrections in charges resulting from any late billing or corrected billing by a third party such as the taxing authority or utility provider. 

(e) Any such accounting by Landlord shall be binding and conclusive upon Tenant unless within nine (9) months after the giving by Landlord of such accounting Tenant shall notify Landlord that Tenant disputes the correctness of such accounting, specifying the particular respects in which the accounting is claimed to be incorrect. If Tenant timely sends a notice to Landlord disputing the accounting received from Landlord, Tenant may, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, undertake an audit of such of Landlord s books as are directly relevant to the Building Operating Expenses and Laboratory Operating Expenses accounting for the Operating Year in question, provided and on condition that (i) there is then no uncured monetary or material non monetary Event of Default under this Lease, (ii) Tenant has made all payments of Additional Rent billed or invoiced by Landlord as of the date of the audit, (iii) the audit is performed only by employees of Tenant s internal accounting department or an independent certified public accounting firm or qualified real estate professional reasonably approved by Landlord and whose fee or other compensation is fixed by contract and is in no manner computed or determined based upon the results of the audit, (iv) both Tenant and its examiners execute and deliver to Landlord a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Landlord whereby such parties expressly agree to maintain the results of such audit in strict confidence, and (v) such audit is commenced and completed and the results thereof delivered to Landlord within ninety (90) days following the date Landlord makes its books available to Tenant (and provided Landlord delivered at least ten (10) days prior written notice to Tenant of the date that the books will be available to Tenant). If Tenant fails to timely deliver a dispute notice to Landlord, 

48

or fails to complete its audit and deliver the results thereof to Landlord within the above referenced ninety (90) day period, then, in either of such events, Landlord s accounting shall be binding and conclusive upon Tenant for all purposes of this Lease. If it is finally determined by mutual agreement or other legal proceeding that Landlord has overstated the applicable Tenant s Pro Rata Share of the Building Operating Expenses or Laboratory Operating Expenses, Landlord shall credit within thirty (30 days following such resolution the amount of such overstatement against the monthly installments of Additional Rent next due under this Lease (or refund within thirty (30) days following such resolution such amount to Tenant if the Term has ended and Tenant has no further obligations to Landlord under this Lease). If it is finally determined by mutually agreement or other legal proceeding that Landlord understated the Additional Rent payable by Tenant, then Landlord may invoice Tenant for any amount by which Tenant s payments under this Section 9.2 was understated, which invoice shall be payable by Tenant within thirty (30) days after receipt of such invoice.

In no event shall Landlord have any liability for damages to Tenant for inconvenience, annoyance or interruption of business arising from such exercise of the power of eminent domain. 

(b) If any part of the Building is taken by any exercise of the right of eminent domain, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease (even if Landlord s entire interest in the Premises may have been divested) by giving notice to Tenant of Landlord s election so to do within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of the effective date of such taking, whereupon this Lease shall terminate thirty (30) days after the date of such notice with the same force and effect as if such date were the date originally established for the expiration of the Term of this Lease.

Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent Tenant from prosecuting in any condemnation proceedings a claim for the value of any of Tenant s Removable Property installed in the Premises by Tenant at Tenant s expense and for relocation expenses, provided that such action shall not affect the amount of compensation otherwise recoverable by Landlord from the taking authority.

Any lease to which this Lease is, at the time referred to, subject and subordinate is herein called Superior Lease and the lessor of a Superior Lease or its successor in interest at the time referred to, is herein called Superior Lessor and any mortgage or other encumbrance to which this Lease is, at the time referred to, subject and subordinate, is herein called Superior Mortgage and the holder of a Superior Mortgage, or its successor in interest at the time referred to, is herein called Superior Mortgagee . If any Superior Mortgagee, shall so elect, this Lease and the rights of Tenant hereunder, shall be superior in right to the rights of such holder, with the same force and effect as if this Lease had been executed, delivered and recorded, or a statutory notice hereof recorded, prior to the execution, delivery and recording of any such Superior Mortgage. The election of any such Superior Mortgagee shall become effective upon either notice from such Superior Mortgagee to Tenant in the same fashion as notices from Landlord to Tenant are to be given hereunder or by the recording in the appropriate registry or recorder s office of an instrument in which the Superior Mortgagee subordinates its rights under such Superior Mortgage to this Lease. 

57

(b) If any Superior Lessor or Superior Mortgagee or the nominee or designee of any Superior Lessor or Superior Mortgagee shall succeed to the rights of Landlord under this Lease, whether through possession or foreclosure action or delivery of a new lease or deed, or otherwise, then at the request of such party so succeeding to Landlord s rights (herein called Successor Landlord ), Tenant shall attorn to and recognize such Successor Landlord as Tenant s landlord under this Lease and shall promptly execute and deliver any instrument that such Successor Landlord may reasonably request to evidence such attornment Tenant waives the provisions of any law or regulation, now or hereafter in effect, which terminates or may give or purport to give Tenant any right to terminate or otherwise affect this Lease or the obligations of Tenant hereunder in the event that any such foreclosure, termination or other proceeding is filed, prosecuted or completed. Upon such attornment, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between the Successor Landlord and Tenant upon all of the terms, conditions and covenants as are set forth in this Lease, except that the Successor Landlord shall not be (i) liable in any way to Tenant for any act or omission, neglect or default on the part of Landlord under this Lease, (ii) responsible for any monies owing by or on deposit with Landlord to the credit of Tenant, (iii) subject to any counterclaim or setoff which theretofore accrued to Tenant against Landlord, (iv) bound by any modification of this Lease subsequent to such Superior Lease or Superior Mortgage, or by any previous prepayment of fixed rent for more than one (1) month, which was not approved in writing by the Superior Lessor or the Superior Mortgagee thereto, (v) liable to the Tenant beyond the Successor Landlord s interest in the Property and the rents, income, receipts, revenues, issues and profits issuing from such Property, (vi) responsible for the performance of any work to be done by the Landlord under this Lease to render the Premises ready for occupancy by the Tenant, (vii) liable for the payment of any improvement allowance or similar amount owing to Tenant on account of the performance of any alterations or leasehold improvements to the Premises or the Building, or (viii) required to remove any person occupying the Premises or any part thereof, except if such person claims by, through or under the Successor Landlord. 

(c) Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Tenant a Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement SNDA in the then customary form of such Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor with respect to any future Superior Mortgages and Superior Leases 1 . Landlord shall in no event be required to expend any monies or commence or prosecute litigation or reject financing which is otherwise satisfactory to it to deliver such an SNDA. Tenant may request customary and reasonable modifications to such SNDA from the Superior Mortgagee and Superior Lessor (as the case may be) except that Landlord s obligations under this Section 13.1(c) shall be deemed fully satisfied when Landlord delivers an SNDA from its Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor, as applicable, on its standard form regardless of the acceptability to such Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor of Tenant s requested modifications.

13.2 Assignment of Rents and Transfer of Title . 

(a) With reference to any assignment by Landlord of Landlord s interest in this Lease, or the rents payable hereunder, conditional in nature or otherwise, which assignment is made to a Superior Mortgagee on property which includes the Premises, Tenant agrees that the execution thereof by Landlord, and the acceptance thereof by the Superior Mortgagee shall never be treated as an assumption by the Superior Mortgagee of any of the obligations of Landlord hereunder unless the Superior Mortgagee shall, by notice sent to Tenant, specifically otherwise elect and, except as aforesaid, the Superior Mortgagee shall be treated as having assumed Landlord s obligations hereunder only upon foreclosure of the Superior Mortgage and the taking of possession of the Premises. 

(b) In no event shall the acquisition of Landlord s interest in the Property by a purchaser which, simultaneously therewith, leases Landlord s entire interest in the Property back to the seller thereof be treated as an assumption by operation of law or otherwise, of Landlord s obligations hereunder, but Tenant shall look solely to such seller lessee, and its successors from time to time in title, for performance of Landlord s obligations hereunder. In any such event, this Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lease to such purchaser (subject to the terms of Section 13.1 above). For all purposes, such seller lessee, and its successors in title, shall be the Landlord hereunder unless and until Landlord s position shall have been assumed by such purchaser lessor. 

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section, in the event of any transfer of title to the Property by Landlord, Landlord shall thereafter be entirely freed and relieved from the performance and observance of all covenants and obligations hereunder; provided, however, Landlord shall be released only to the extent such Successor Landlord shall have assumed all of Landlord s obligations as under this Lease. 

13.3 Notice to Mortgagee . To the extent Landlord or such Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor, as applicable, has provided notice addresses for any Superior Mortgagee and Superior Lessor, Tenant shall not seek to enforce any remedy it may have for any default on the part of Landlord without first giving any Superior Mortgagee and Superior Lessor, as applicable, written notice by reputable express mail service (e.g., FedEx), specifying the default in reasonable detail, and affording such Superior Mortgagee and Superior Lessor, as applicable, (i) a reasonable opportunity to perform Landlord s obligations hereunder (but not less than thirty (30) days), if such default can be cured without such Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor, as applicable, taking possession of the mortgaged or leased estate, or (ii) time to obtain possession of the mortgaged or leased estate and then to cure such default of Landlord, if such default cannot be cured without such Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor taking possession of the mortgaged or leased estate. The curing of any of Landlord s defaults by a Superior Mortgagee or Superior Lessor shall be treated as performance by Landlord.

then in any such case Landlord may exercise any of Landlord s rights or remedies available under this Lease, at law or in equity. 

14.2 Landlord s Remedies . 

(a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Landlord shall have the following remedies, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies available at Law or in equity or otherwise provided in this Lease, any one or more of which Landlord may resort to cumulatively, consecutively, or in the alternative: 

(i) Landlord may continue this Lease in full force and effect, and collect Rent and other charges as and when due, without prejudice to Landlord s right to subsequently elect to terminate this Lease on account of such Event of Default; 

(ii) Landlord may terminate this Lease upon five (5) days prior written notice to Tenant to such effect, in which event this Lease (and all of Tenant s rights hereunder) shall immediately terminate, but such termination shall not affect those obligations of Tenant which are intended by their terms to survive the expiration or termination of this Lease, and Tenant shall remain liable for damages as hereinafter set forth in this Section 14.2 . This Lease may also be terminated by a judgment specifically providing for termination; 

(iii) Landlord may terminate Tenant s right of possession without terminating this Lease upon written notice to Tenant to such effect, in which event Tenant s right of possession of the Premises shall immediately terminate, but this Lease shall continue subject to the effect of this Section 14.2 ; 

(iv) Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, perform any defaulted obligation of Tenant, and to recover from Tenant, as Additional Rent, the reasonable actual costs incurred by Landlord in performing such obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other notice and cure period set forth herein, Landlord may exercise its rights under this Section 14.2(a)(iv) without prior notice or upon shorter notice than otherwise required hereunder (and as may be reasonable under the circumstances) in the event of any one or more of the following circumstances is present: (A) there exists a reasonable risk of prosecution of Landlord unless such obligation is performed sooner than the stated cure period; (B) there exists an emergency arising out of the defaulted obligation; or (C) Tenant has failed to obtain insurance required by this Lease, or such insurance has been canceled by the insurer without being timely replaced by Tenant, as required herein; and 

61

(v) Landlord shall have the right to recover damages from Tenant, as set forth in this Section 14.2 . 

(b) Upon any termination of this Lease or of Tenant s right of possession, Landlord, at its sole election, may (i) re enter the Premises, either by summary proceedings, or other lawful proceedings, and remove and dispossess Tenant and all other persons and any and all property from the same, as if this Lease had not been made, (ii) if Tenant already has vacated the Premises, remove all property from the Premises and store the same in a public warehouse or elsewhere at Tenant s expense, and/or (iii) deem such property to be abandoned, and, in such event, Landlord may dispose of such property at Tenant s expense, free from any claim by Tenant or anyone claiming by, through or under Tenant. It shall not constitute a constructive or other termination of this Lease or Tenant s right to possession if Landlord (a) exercises its right to repair or maintain the Premises, (b) performs any unperformed obligations of Tenant, (c) stores or removes Tenant s property from the Premises after Tenant s dispossession, (d) attempts to relet, or, in fact, does relet, the Premises or (e) seeks the appointment of a receiver on Landlord s initiative to protect Landlord s interest under this Lease. 

(c) If this Lease shall have been terminated as provided in this Article, Tenant shall pay the Basic Rent, Expense Charges, Additional Rent and other sums payable hereunder up to the time of such termination, and thereafter Tenant, until the end of what would have been the Term of this Lease in the absence of such termination, and whether or not the Premises shall have been relet, shall be liable to Landlord for, and shall pay to Landlord, as liquidated current damages: (x) the Basic Rent, Expense Charges, Additional Rent and other sums that would be payable hereunder if such termination had not occurred, less the net proceeds, if any, of any reletting of the Premises, after deducting all actual expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with such reletting, including, without limitation, all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorneys fees, advertising, expenses of employees, alteration costs and expenses of preparation for such reletting; and (y) if, in accordance with Section 3.1(a) , Tenant commenced payment of the full amount of Basic Rent on any day other than the Commencement Date, the amount of Basic Rent that would have been payable during the period beginning on the Commencement Date and ending on the day Tenant commenced payment of the full amount of Basic Rent under such Section 3.1(a) . Tenant shall pay the portion of such current damages referred to in clause (x) above to Landlord monthly on the days which the Basic Rent would have been payable hereunder if this Lease had not been terminated, and Tenant shall pay the portion of such current damages referred to in clause (y) above to Landlord upon such termination. 

62

(d) At any time after termination of this Lease as provided in this Article, whether or not Landlord shall have collected any such current damages, as liquidated final damages and in lieu of all such current damages beyond the date of such demand, at Landlord s election Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Basic Rent, Expense Charges, Additional Rent and other sums as hereinbefore provided which would be payable hereunder from the date of such demand assuming that, for the purposes of this paragraph, annual payments by Tenant on account of Taxes, Building Operating Expenses and Laboratory Operating Expenses would be the same as the payments required for the immediately preceding Operating or Tax Year plus a three percent (3 annual increase per year for what would be the then unexpired Term of this Lease if the same remained in effect, over the then fair net rental value of the Premises for the same period. 

(e) In case of any Event of Default, re entry, expiration and dispossession by summary proceedings or other lawful proceedings, Landlord may (i) relet the Premises or any part or parts thereof, either in the name of Landlord or otherwise, for a term or terms which may at Landlord s option be equal to or less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term of this Lease and may grant concessions or free rent to the extent that Landlord considers advisable and necessary to relet the same and (ii) make such alterations, repairs and decorations in the Premises as Landlord considers advisable and necessary for the purpose of reletting the Premises; and the making of such alterations, repairs and decorations shall not operate or be construed to release Tenant from liability hereunder as aforesaid. Tenant, for itself and any and all persons claiming through or under Tenant, including its creditors, upon the termination of this Lease and of the term of this Lease in accordance with the terms hereof, or in the event of entry of judgment for the recovery of the possession of the Premises in any action or proceeding, or if Landlord shall enter the Premises by process of law or other lawful proceedings, hereby waives any right of redemption provided or permitted by any statute, law or decision now or hereafter in force, and does hereby waive, surrender and give up all rights or privileges which it or they may or might have under and by reason of any present or future law or decision, to redeem the Premises or for a continuation of this Lease for the term of this Lease hereby demised after having been dispossessed or ejected therefrom by process of law, or other lawful proceedings. 

(f) In addition to any other remedies under this Article 14 , Tenant shall immediately become liable to Landlord for all damages proximately caused by Tenant s breach of its obligations under this Lease, including all actual costs Landlord incurs in reletting (or attempting to relet) the Premises or any part thereof, including, without limitation, brokers commissions, expenses of cleaning, altering and preparing the Premises for new tenants, legal fees and all other like expenses properly chargeable against the Premises and the rental received therefrom and like costs, provided that nothing set forth in this Section 14.2(f) shall be construed to impose upon Landlord any obligation to relet the Premises or to mitigate its damages hereunder, except to the extent expressly required under applicable Law. If Landlord does elect to relet the Premises (or 

63

any portion thereof), such reletting may be for a period shorter or longer than the remaining Term, and upon such terms and conditions as Landlord deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion, and Tenant shall have no interest in any sums collected by Landlord in connection with such reletting except to the extent expressly set forth herein. If the Premises or any part thereof shall be relet in combination with any other space, then proper apportionment on a per-square foot basis shall be made of the rent received from such reletting and of the expenses of such reletting. If Landlord shall succeed in reletting the Premises during the period in which Tenant is paying monthly rent damages as described in Section 14.2(c) , Landlord shall credit Tenant with the net rents (inclusive of Additional Rent) collected by Landlord from such reletting, after first deducting from the gross rents (inclusive of Additional Rent), as and when collected by Landlord, (A) all expenses incurred or paid by Landlord in collecting such rents, and (B) any theretofore unrecovered actual costs as a result of the termination of this Lease or Landlord s reentry into the Premises, including any theretofore unrecovered expenses of reletting or other damages payable hereunder. If the Premises or any portion thereof be relet by Landlord for the unexpired portion of the Term before presentation of proof of such damages to any court, commission or tribunal, the amount of rent reserved upon such reletting shall, prima facie, constitute the fair and reasonable rental value for the Premises, or part thereof, so relet for the term of the reletting. Landlord shall not be liable in any way whatsoever for its inability to relet the Premises or, if the Premises or any part are relet, for its failure to collect the rent under such reletting, and no such inability to relet or failure to collect rent shall release or affect Tenant s liability for damages or otherwise under this Lease. The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event of termination of this Lease or repossession of the Premises after an Event of Default of Tenant, and provided Tenant has cooperated with Landlord in timely surrendering possession of the Premises as required herein after such termination or repossession, Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages hereunder, provided, however, Landlord s obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages shall be deemed satisfied by Landlord s marketing of the Premises in a manner substantially similar to the manner in which Landlord markets other premises within the Building, and provided further, that Landlord shall not be obligated to show preference for reletting the Premises over any other vacant space in the Building, to lease any space while Landlord is assembling such space as part of a block of space for lease, or to lease the Premises for a rental less than the current fair market rent then prevailing for comparable office space in Comparable Buildings. 

(g) If the trustee or the debtor in possession assumes the Lease under applicable bankruptcy law, it may assume and assign its interest in this Lease only if the proposed assignee first provides Landlord with (1) written notice of such proposed assignment, setting forth (i) the name and address of the proposed assignee, its proposed use of the Premises, reasonably detailed character and financial references for such person (including its most recent balance sheet and income statements certified by its chief financial officer or, if available, a certified public accountant) and any other information reasonably requested by Landlord, and (ii) all of the terms and conditions of such offer, shall be given to Landlord by Tenant or such trustee no later than twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by Tenant or such trustee of such offer, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date that Tenant or such trustee shall make application 

64

to a court of competent jurisdiction for authority and approval to assume this Lease and enter into such assignment; (2) Adequate Assurance of Future Performance (as hereinafter defined) of all of Tenant s obligations under this Lease, and (3) Landlord determines, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, that the assignment of this Lease will not breach any other lease, or any mortgage, financing agreement, or other agreement relating to the Property by which Landlord or the Property is then bound (and Landlord shall not be required to obtain consents or waivers from any third party required under any lease, mortgage, financing agreement, or other such agreement by which Landlord is then bound). Landlord shall have the option, to be exercised by written notice to Tenant or such trustee given at any time prior to the date the application is filed for court approval of the assumption and assignment of this Lease to the proposed assignee, to accept an assignment of this Lease upon the same terms and conditions and for the same consideration, if any, as the bona fide offer made by such proposed assignee, less any brokerage commissions which may be payable out of the consideration to be paid by such person for the assignment of this Lease. 

(h) For purposes only of paragraph (g) above, and in addition to any other requirements under the Bankruptcy Code, any future federal bankruptcy law and applicable case law, Adequate Assurance of Future Performance means at least the satisfaction of the following conditions, which Landlord and Tenant acknowledge to be commercially reasonable: 

(i) the proposed assignee submitting a current financial statement, audited by a certified public accountant, that allows a net worth and working capital in amounts determined in the reasonable business judgment of Landlord to be sufficient to assure the future performance by the assignee of Tenant s obligation under this Lease; and 

(ii) if requested by Landlord in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, the proposed assignee obtaining a guarantee (in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord) from one or more persons who satisfy Landlord s standards of creditworthiness; and 

(iii) the proposed assignee is of a character and financial worth such as is in keeping with the standards of Landlord in those respects for the Property, the assignee s tenancy is of the same quality as other tenants at the Property, and the purposes for which the proposed assignee intends to use the Premises are uses expressly permitted by and not prohibited by this Lease or lawfully prohibited by any other lease at the Property. 

14.3 Remedies Cumulative . The specified remedies to which Landlord may resort hereunder are not intended to be exclusive of any remedies or means of redress to which Landlord may at any time be entitled lawfully, and Landlord may invoke any remedy (including the remedy of specific performance) allowed at law or in equity as if specific remedies were not herein provided for. 

65

14.4 Waiver . 

(a) Failure on the part of Landlord or Tenant to complain of any action or non action on the part of the other, no matter how long the same may continue, shall never be a waiver by Tenant or Landlord, respectively, of any of the other s rights hereunder. Further, no waiver at any time of any of the provisions hereof by Landlord or Tenant shall be construed as a waiver of any of the other provisions hereof, and a waiver at any time of any of the provisions hereof shall not be construed as a waiver at any subsequent time of the same provisions. The consent or approval of Landlord or Tenant to or of any action by the other requiring such consent or approval shall not be construed to waive or render unnecessary Landlord s or Tenant s consent or approval to or of any subsequent similar act by the other. 

(b) Any waiver by Landlord of any provisions of this Lease must be in a writing signed by Landlord. In addition, Landlord s acceptance of any payment from Tenant after a termination of this Lease due to an Event of Default by Tenant shall not have the effect of reinstating this Lease, nor estop Landlord from exercising any of the rights and remedies granted to Landlord hereunder arising out of such Event of Default. No payment by Tenant or acceptance by Landlord of a lesser amount than the Basic Rent, Expense Charges, Additional Rent and other sums due hereunder shall be deemed to be other than on account of the total amount due from Tenant to Landlord, to be applied in such order as Landlord deems appropriate. In no event shall any endorsement or statement on any check or accompanying any check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction; and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord s right to recover the balance of such Basic Rent, Expense Charges, Additional Rent or other sum and to pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease. 

14.5 Letter of Credit 

(a) As additional consideration for Landlord s agreement to enter into this Lease, concurrently with Tenant's execution of this Lease and as a condition precedent to Landlord s obligations under this Lease, Tenant covenants and agrees to deliver to Landlord, as additional consideration, an irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit (as the same may be amended, supplemented or replaced, the Letter of Credit in the amount of Five Hundred Sixty-Eight Thousand Three Hundred Seventy-Five and 80/100 Dollars 568,375.80) LC Amount ), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E or on another form reasonably acceptable to Landlord and in all events containing the terms and conditions required under this Section 14.5 , payable by draw in Boston, Massachusetts (and via facsimile or email), running in favor of Landlord issued by a solvent nationally recognized bank (the Bank acceptable to Landlord in Landlord's sole discretion and meets all of the following requirements (collectively, the Letter of Credit Issuer Requirements ): (i) is chartered under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and (ii) has a short term Fitch Rating which is not less than F1 , and a long term Fitch Rating which is not less than A (or in the event such Fitch Ratings are no longer available, a comparable rating from Standard and Poor s Professional Rating Service or Moody s Professional Rating Service). 

66

(b) The Letter of Credit shall: (i) be payable upon demand, irrevocable and unconditional; (ii) be subject to the terms of this Section 3.2, maintained in effect, for an initial term plus annual automatic extensions thereof, for the entire period from the date of execution of this Lease and continuing until the date which is ninety (90) days after the Expiration Date (the LC Expiration Date (iii) be subject to the International Standby Practices 1998, International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 590; (iv) be fully assignable by Landlord and successive transfers permitted; and (v) permit partial and multiple draws. Landlord, or its then managing agent, shall have the right and may elect, from time to time in Landlord s sole discretion, without notice or demand to Tenant, to draw down all or any part of the amount up to the face amount of the Letter of Credit if (1) Tenant has failed to timely pay or perform any of its obligations under this Lease and such failure continues beyond notice (the delivery of which shall not be required for purposes of this Section 14.5 if Landlord is prevented or prohibited from delivering the same under applicable Law, including, but not limited to, all applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws) and the expiration of any applicable cure periods (except that no notice and cure period shall be required for purposes of this Section 14.5 with respect to any default by Tenant hereunder if, at the time of such default, any of the events set forth in Section 14.1(a)(iv) above shall have occurred with or without the acquiescence of Tenant), (2) the Bank delivers written notice to Landlord that the Letter of Credit will not be extended beyond the current expiration date thereof which would result in the Letter of Credit expiring prior to the LC Expiration Date (which the Bank shall only have the right to do if it provides Landlord with such notice at least sixty (60) days' prior to such current expiration date) and Tenant has failed to deliver a replacement Letter of Credit at least thirty (30) days prior to such current expiration date, (3) Tenant has filed a voluntary petition under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (4) an involuntary petition has been filed against Tenant under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (5) this Lease was rejected or deemed rejected in any proceeding under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (6) Tenant enters into an assignment for the benefit of creditors or is the subject any receivership, conservatorship, or similar proceedings or otherwise becomes insolvent, or (7) Tenant has taken steps in furtherance of a proceeding under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or in Landlord s reasonable discretion, Tenant is insolvent. The Letter of Credit shall provide that the Letter of Credit will be honored by the Bank without inquiry as to the accuracy of any statements made by Landlord or whether any defaults exist under this Lease and regardless of whether the Tenant disputes the content of such statements or default. The Letter of Credit shall also provide that Landlord may, at any time and from time to time and without notice to Tenant and without obtaining Tenant's consent thereto, transfer its interest in and to the Letter of Credit to another person or entity as a part of the assignment by Landlord of its rights and interests in and to this Lease. In the event of a transfer of Landlord's interest in the Building or the Premises, Landlord shall effect a transfer of the Letter of Credit to the transferee and thereupon Landlord shall, without any further agreement between the parties, be fully and forever released by Tenant from all liability therefor, and it is agreed that the provisions hereof shall apply to each and every transfer or assignment of the Letter of Credit to a new landlord. In connection with any such transfer of the Letter of Credit by Landlord, Tenant shall be responsible for paying the Bank's transfer and processing fees in connection therewith. In the event the Bank does not timely effectuate a transfer initiated by Landlord, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days following notice from Landlord, deliver a new Letter of Credit issued in favor of and naming the transferee as the beneficiary. 

67

(c) If, as result of any draw by Landlord of all or any part of the Letter of Credit, the amount of the Letter of Credit shall be less than the LC Amount, then Tenant shall, within ten (10) days following such draw by Landlord, provide Landlord with additional letter(s) of credit in an amount equal to the deficiency and any such additional letter of credit shall comply with all of the provisions of this Section 14.5 , and if Tenant fails to comply with the foregoing, the same shall constitute an uncurable default by Tenant under this Lease. Tenant further covenants and warrants that it will neither assign nor encumber the Letter of Credit or any part thereof, and that neither Landlord nor its successors or assigns will be bound by any such assignment, encumbrance, attempted assignment or attempted encumbrance. If, at any time prior to the LC Expiration Date, the Letter of Credit is not timely renewed in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.5 above, or if Tenant fails to maintain the Letter of Credit in the amount and in accordance with the terms set forth in this Section 14.5 , Landlord shall have the right to present the Letter of Credit to the Bank in accordance with the terms of this Section 14.5 and the proceeds of the Letter of Credit may be applied by Landlord against any Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease that is not paid when due and/or to pay for all losses and damages that Landlord has suffered or that Landlord reasonably estimates that it will suffer as a result of any default by Tenant under this Lease. In the event any of the conditions allowing Landlord to draw on the Letter of Credit set forth in this Section 14.5 occur, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedies of Landlord, draw on the entirety of the Letter of Credit irrespective of the amount Rent then due or any other obligations then due and owing under this Lease and Landlord may immediately (or at any time in the future) apply any proceeds of the Letter of Credit against any Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease that was not paid when due and/or used to pay for any losses and/or damages suffered by Landlord (or reasonably estimated by Landlord that it will suffer) as a result of any default by Tenant under this Lease, including, but not limited to, any losses and/or damages arising upon the termination of this Lease. Any proceeds of the Letter of Credit drawn by Landlord that are not applied by Landlord to amounts then due under this Lease or to Landlord's damages shall constitute the property of Landlord and need not be segregated from Landlord's other assets. Provided Tenant has timely surrendered possession of the Premises to Landlord in the condition required under this Lease, Landlord agrees to pay to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the LC Expiration Date the amount of any proceeds of the Letter of Credit received by Landlord and not applied against any Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease that was not paid when due and/or used to pay for any losses and/or damages suffered by Landlord (or reasonably estimated by Landlord that it will suffer) as a result of any default by Tenant under this Lease; provided, however, that if prior to the LC Expiration Date a voluntary petition is filed by Tenant, or an involuntary petition is filed against Tenant by any of Tenant's creditors, under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, then Landlord shall not be obligated to make such payment in the amount of the unused Letter of Credit proceeds until either all preference and fraudulent transfer issues relating to payments under this Lease have been resolved in such bankruptcy or reorganization case or such bankruptcy or reorganization case has been dismissed.

(e) Tenant hereby acknowledges and agrees that Landlord is entering into this Lease in material reliance upon the ability of Landlord to draw upon the Letter of Credit upon the occurrence of any default on the part of Tenant under this Lease. If there shall occur a default by Tenant under this Lease and such default continues beyond notice (the delivery of which shall not be required for purposes of this Section 14.5 if Landlord is prevented or prohibited from delivering the same under applicable Law, including, but not limited to, all applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws) and the expiration of any applicable cure periods under Section 14.1 (except that no notice and cure period shall be required for purposes of this Section 14.5 with respect to any default by Tenant hereunder if, at the time of such default, any of the events set forth in Section 14.1(a)(iv) above shall have occurred with or without the acquiescence of Tenant) or there shall occur a default of Tenant under this Section 14.5 (which default by Tenant under this Section 14.5 shall not have any additional notice and cure periods except as expressly provided for and/or waived under this Section 14.5 ), Landlord may, but without obligation to do so, draw upon the Letter of Credit in part or in whole, to cure any default of Tenant and/or to compensate Landlord for any and all damages of any kind or nature sustained or which Landlord reasonably estimates that it will sustain resulting from Tenant's default.

Provided that, both at the time of exercise or at the commencement of the applicable Extended Term (as hereinafter defined), (i) this Lease is in full force and effect, and (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (either at the time of exercise or at the commencement of the applicable Extended Term), and (iii) Tenant is in occupancy of not less than 75 of the Premises and Tenant shall not have assigned this Lease or sublet more than 25 of the Premises (other than a transfer permitted without Landlord s consent pursuant to Section 6.1(b) (any of which conditions described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) may be waived by Landlord at any time in Landlord s sole discretion), Tenant shall have the option to extend the Term of this Lease for up to one (1) extended term (each an Extended Term of five (5) years by giving written notice to Landlord (an Extension Notice not later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration date of the Term then in effect. The effective giving of such notice of extension by Tenant shall automatically extend the Term of this Lease for the Extended Term, and no instrument of renewal or extension need be executed. In the event that Tenant fails timely to give such notice to Landlord, this Lease shall automatically terminate at the end of the Term then in effect, and Tenant shall have no further option to extend the Term of this Lease. The Extended Term shall commence on the day immediately succeeding the expiration date of the original Term, as the case may be, and shall end on the day immediately preceding the fifth (5th) anniversary of the first day of such Extended Term. The Extended Term shall be on all the terms and conditions of this Lease, except (1) the Basic Rent for the Extended Term shall be ninety-five percent (95 of the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises as of the commencement of the Extended Term, and (2) Landlord shall not be required to furnish any materials or perform any work to prepare the Premises for Tenant s occupancy during the Extended Term and Landlord shall not be required to provide or pay any work allowance or reimburse Tenant for any alterations made or to be made by Tenant, or to grant Tenant any rent concession with respect to any of the Extended Terms. The termination of this Lease during the initial Term or the failure of Tenant to exercise its option to extend the Term, shall terminate and render void any option or right on Tenant s part to extend this Lease, and nothing contained in this Section 16.1 shall prevent Landlord from exercising any right granted to or reserved by Landlord in this Lease to terminate this Lease. Tenant s right under this Article 16 shall be personal to the Original Tenant under this Lease and shall not apply in favor of or be exercisable by any assignee of this Lease (other than a permitted transferee pursuant to Section 6.1(b) of this Lease), nor any sublessee of all or any portion of the Premises. 

16.2 Determination of Fair Market Rental Value . Provided Tenant has timely delivered an Extension Notice hereunder to extend the Term of this Lease pursuant to Section 16.1 above and the conditions for Tenant s exercise have been satisfied, Landlord shall provide Tenant, at least six (6) months prior to the then expiration of the Term of this Lease, with Landlord s good faith estimate of the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises for the upcoming 

80

Extended Term. If Tenant disagrees with Landlord s estimate of the Fair Market Rental Value as set forth in Landlord s notice referred to above, Tenant shall notify Landlord within fifteen (15) Business Days after its receipt of Landlord s notice setting forth Tenant s estimate of the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises and the parties agree to act in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises for the Extended Term. If Tenant fails to notify Landlord that Tenant disagrees with Landlord s estimate and setting forth Tenant s Fair Market Rental Value estimate within such fifteen (15) Business Day period then Tenant will be deemed to have accepted Landlord s estimate of the Fair Market Rental Value for the Premises during the Extended Term. If Tenant has timely given its dispute notice and the parties are unable to reach agreement thereon within thirty (30) days after the delivery of such notice by Tenant, then either party may submit the determination of the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises to arbitration by giving notice to the other party naming the initiating party s arbitrator within ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period. Within fifteen (15) days after receiving a notice of initiation of arbitration, the responding party shall appoint its own arbitrator by notifying the initiating party of the responding party s arbitrator. If the second arbitrator shall not have been so appointed within such fifteen (15) day period, the initiating party shall deliver written notice of such failure to the responding party and the responding party shall have a period of ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice to appoint its arbitrator and deliver written notice thereof to the initiating party. If the responding party fails to notify the initiating party of its designated arbitrator within the foregoing additional ten (10) Business Day period, then the second arbitrator shall be chosen in the same manner as described below with respect to the selection of the third arbitrator. Upon the selection (or appointment, as the case may be) of the second arbitrator, the two arbitrators thus appointed shall, within fifteen (15) days after the responding party s notice of appointment of the second arbitrator, appoint a third arbitrator. If the two initial arbitrators are unable timely to agree on the third arbitrator, then either may, on behalf of both, request such appointment by the Boston office of the American Arbitration Association, or its successor, or, on its failure, refusal or inability to act, by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises for the Extended Term shall be determined by the method commonly known as baseball arbitration , whereby Landlord s selected arbitrator and Tenant s selected arbitrator shall each set forth its respective determination of the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises, and the third arbitrator must select one or the other (it being understood that the third arbitrator shall be expressly prohibited from selecting a compromise figure). Landlord s selected arbitrator and Tenant s selected arbitrator shall deliver their determinations of the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises to the third arbitrator within five (5) Business Days of the appointment of the third arbitrator and the third arbitrator shall render his or her decision within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of both of the other two determinations of the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises. The third arbitrator s decision shall be binding on both Landlord and Tenant. All arbitrators shall be commercial real estate brokers who are independent from the parties and who have had at least ten (10) years experience in Comparable Buildings. Each party shall pay the fees of its own arbitrator, and the fees of the third arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties. In the event Tenant initiates the aforesaid arbitration process and as of the commencement of the Extended Term the amount of the Basic Rent for the Extended Term has not been determined, Tenant shall pay the amount determined by Landlord for the Premises and when the determination has actually been made, an appropriate retroactive adjustment shall be made as of the commencement of the Extended Term if necessary. In the event that such determination shall 

81

result in an overpayment by Tenant of any Basic Rent, such overpayment shall be paid by Landlord to Tenant promptly after such determination has been made, and if such determination shall result in an underpayment by Tenant of any Basic Rent, Tenant shall pay any such amounts to Landlord promptly following such determination. As used in this Lease, the term Fair Market Rental Value shall mean the fixed annual rent and additional rent that owners of Comparable Buildings with comparable amenities (retail, food and beverages, parking, etc. but exclusive of the Rink Portion of the Building) have agreed to accept, and nonaffiliated, tenants of Comparable Buildings have agreed to pay in current arms-length, nonequity transactions for comparable space, for a term comparable to the applicable Extended Term and taking into account all other then relevant factors, and considering recent comparable transactions with comparable credit tenants and comparable uses as the Premises in Comparable Buildings.

Without limiting Tenant s obligations to complete all of the Tenant Work to the Premises in accordance with the terms hereof, Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord shall have no obligation to pay or fund the final installment of Landlord s Contribution if the Tenant Work to the Premises is not substantially complete and conditions (i) through (vi) above are not satisfied within twelve (12) months following the Commencement Date of this Lease; provided however, the aforesaid twelve (12) month time limit shall be stayed pending the final adjudication of any disputes relating to the Tenant Work.
