CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain
statements that we make from time to time, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this
Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these
forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe
may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements
by terms such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, depends, 
 estimate, expects, intend, may, ongoing, plan, potential, 
 predict, project, should, will, would or the negative of those
terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain those words. We have based these forward-looking
statements on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition,
results of operations, strategy, short- and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. 

Our
operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could
materially affect our results of operations and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. We have based
these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may
affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives,
and financial needs. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q include, without limitation, statements reflecting management s
expectations for future financial performance and operating expenditures (including our ability to continue as a going concern, to raise
additional capital and to succeed in our future operations), expected growth, profitability and business outlook, and operating expenses. 

Forward-looking
statements are only current predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our
actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those anticipated by such statements.
These factors include, among other things, the unknown risks and uncertainties that we believe could cause actual results to differ from
these forward looking statements as set forth under the heading, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and other
documents we file with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of
the risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, risks and uncertainties
relating to: 

our
 projected financial position and estimated cash burn rate; 

our
 estimates regarding expenses, future revenues and capital requirements; 

our
 ability to continue as a going concern; 

our
 ability to raise substantial additional capital in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms to fund our operations and our business
 plan; 

our
 ability to reverse the recent decline in our revenue and resume growing our revenue; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our current products and services; 

our
 ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the potential for us to incur substantial costs from lawsuits to enforce
 or protect our intellectual property rights; 

the
 possibility that a third party may claim we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights
 and that we may incur substantial costs and be required to devote substantial time defending against these claims; 

our
 reliance on third-party suppliers; 

the
 success of competing products or services that are or become available; 

our
 ability to expand our organization to accommodate potential growth and our ability to retain and attract key personnel; and 

the
 potential for us to incur substantial costs resulting from lawsuits against us and the potential for these lawsuits to cause us to
 limit our commercialization of our products and services. 

These
forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Risk
Factors in our Form 10-K/A and in other documents we file with the SEC. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly
changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess
the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Form 10-Q may not occur, and actual results could differ materially and
adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected
in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events
and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, except as required by law, neither
we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation
to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual
results or to changes in our expectations. 

You
should read this Form 10-Q and the documents that we incorporate by reference in this Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual
future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. As a result
of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed
or implied by these forward-looking statements including those described in this Form 10-Q and in the Risk Factors section
of our Form 10-K/A and other documents we file with the SEC.

NOTES
TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million and 
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of
 
million as of September 30, 2024. The Company s cash and Bitcoin balance of 
million and million, respectively, is not adequate to fund its operations through at least twelve months from the date these
condensed consolidated financial statements were available for issuance. Therefore, these conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

To
continue in existence and expand its operations, the Company will be required to, and management plans to, raise additional working capital
through an equity or debt offering and ultimately hopes to attain profitable operations to fulfill its operating and capital requirements
for at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements. However, the Company may not
be able to secure such financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, if the Company issues equity securities
to raise additional funds, its existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences
and privileges senior to those of the Company s existing stockholders. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue
receiving working capital cash payments and generating cash flow from operations. 

Risks
and uncertainties 

The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the markets it serves, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial
market conditions, fluctuations in customer demand, acceptance of new products, development by its competitors of new technological innovations,
dependence on key personnel, and protection of proprietary technology. 

In
addition, the Company has invested in Bitcoin, which is a crypto asset. Crypto assets are loosely regulated and there is no central marketplace
for currency exchange. Supply is determined by a computer code, not by a central bank, and prices have been extremely volatile. Certain
crypto asset exchanges have been closed due to fraud, failure or security breaches. Any of the Company s crypto assets that reside
on an exchange that shuts down may be lost. Several factors may affect the price of crypto assets, including, but not limited to: supply
and demand, investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates or future regulatory
measures (if any) that restrict the trading of crypto assets, and the use of crypto assets as a form of payment. There is no assurance
that crypto assets will maintain their long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future, or that acceptance of crypto asset
payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will continue to grow. 

As
crypto assets have grown in popularity and market size, various countries and jurisdictions have begun to develop regulations governing
the crypto asset industry. To the extent future regulatory actions or policies limit the ability to exchange crypto assets or utilize
them for payments, the demand for crypto assets could be reduced. Furthermore, regulatory actions may limit the ability of end-users
to convert crypto assets into fiat currency (e.g., U.S. dollars) or use crypto assets to pay for goods and services. Such regulatory
actions or policies could result in a reduction of demand, and in turn, a decline in the underlying crypto asset unit prices. 

The
effect of any future regulatory change on crypto assets in general is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and
adverse to the Company and the value of the Company s investments in crypto assets. 

Crypto
assets are not insured or protected under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC or the Securities Investor Protection
Company SIPC ). Accordingly, with respect to its Bitcoin investment, the Company does not enjoy the protections of other
assets covered by the FDIC or SIPC.

The
Company operates in one operating segment and, accordingly, no segment disclosures have been presented herein.

are the result of the Company acquiring Bitcoin with liquid assets from private placements, while dispositions are the
result of sales of Bitcoin. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had Bitcoin dispositions of million,
inclusive of realized losses of thousand. The Company uses a first-in, first-out methodology to assign costs to Bitcoin for purposes
of the Bitcoin held and realized gains and losses disclosure above. Bitcoin is included in current assets in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet due to the Company s ability to sell them in a highly liquid marketplace and its intent to liquidate its Bitcoin
to support operations when needed. 

or annually from the date of issuance until the outstanding principal
was paid or converted. In connection with the issuance of Convertible Promissory Notes in 2022 and 2023, the Company also issued warrants
at an exercise price of per share (the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants ). See additional information on the
accounting for the warrants in Note 10. 

The
Convertible Promissory Notes were issued for general working capital purposes. The Company elected the fair value option FVO of accounting under ASC 825, Financial Instruments , for its Convertible Promissory Notes. Under the FVO election, the financial
instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring
basis at each reporting period date. The estimated fair value adjustment is presented as a single line item within other expense (income),
net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption change in fair value of convertible promissory
notes. 

In
November 2023, all Convertible Promissory Notes were converted pursuant to their provision in connection with the Business Combination
between Data Knights and Legacy ONMD and were no longer outstanding as of December 31, 2023. See the Form 10-K/A for all other details
relating to the Convertible Promissory Notes issued prior to December 31, 2023. 

PIPE
Notes 

On
June 28, 2023, The PIPE Notes matured on the first anniversary of the issuance date, or
November 7, 2024. The majority of the PIPE Notes holders have elected to convert their PIPE Notes into shares of Common Stock, which
will occur upon the Company s filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-1. 

The
Company elected the FVO of accounting for its PIPE Notes. The estimated fair value adjustment is presented as a single line item
within other expense (income), net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption change in
fair value of PIPE Notes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the PIPE Notes was 
million and million, respectively, which is included in current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Shareholder
Loans 

From
January to June 2024, the Company received gross proceeds of million in connection with shareholder loans with a related party investor
which are convertible into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of per share. These loans do not bear interest
and mature one year from issuance. The balance of million is included in loan related party on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 

Helena
Notes 

On
March 28, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement (the Helena SPA with Helena Global
Investment Opportunities 1 Ltd. Helena ), an affiliate of Helena Partners Inc., a Cayman Islands-based advisor and investor
providing for up to million in funding through a private placement for the issuance of senior secured convertible notes and warrants
across multiple tranches. The Helena SPA was subsequently terminated in June 2024 prior to the closing of any tranches (the Helena
Termination Agreement ). As such, except as described below, the Helena SPA had no impact on the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Pursuant
to the Helena Termination Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to Helena a warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock at an
exercise price of per share (the Helena Termination Warrants and agreed to reimburse Helena for certain reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with entry into the Helena SPA and Helena Termination Agreement
and related documents. The Company incurred legal fees and expenses of thousand in connection with the Helena Termination Agreement.
As of September 30, 2024, the Helena Termination Warrants were not yet issued or outstanding. However, in accordance with the loss contingency
guidance of ASC Topic 450, Contingencies , the Company determined that it was probable that a liability had been incurred (its
obligation to issue warrants) and the amount of the loss could be reasonably estimated (the fair value of warrants at an exercise
price of per share). Therefore, the Company recorded stock warrant expense of thousand in its condensed consolidated statement
of operations, with an offsetting liability to accounts payable and accrued expenses on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The
Company will reclassify the contingent liability to equity or warrant liabilities under applicable guidance when the Helena Termination
Warrants are issued, which occurred in December 2024. 

Yorkville
Note 

On
June 17, 2024, the Company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement SEPA with YA II PN, LTD, a Cayman Islands
exempt limited partnership managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP Yorkville (see Note 7). Upon entry into the SEPA,
the Company issued Yorkville a million convertible promissory note for million in cash (after a original issue discount)
(the Yorkville Note ). The Yorkville Note does not bear interest and matures on . The Floor
Price is per share, subject to the Company s option to reduce the Floor Price to any amounts set forth in a written
notice to Yorkville. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default (as defined in the Yorkville Note), the Yorkville
Note will become immediately due and payable. The issuance of the Common Stock upon conversion of the note and otherwise under the SEPA
is capped at of the outstanding Common Stock as of June 18, 2024. Further, the note and SEPA include a beneficial ownership blocker
for Yorkville such that Yorkville may not be deemed the beneficial owner of more than of the Company s Common Stock. As a
result of the Company s failure to file its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 by August 14, 2024 (i.e., a deemed
Event of Default under the Yorkville Note), the Company began accruing interest at the default rate of as of August 14, 2024. A
further event of default occurred as a result of the Company s failure to file a registration statement with the SEC for the resale
by Yorkville of the shares of Common Stock issuable under the SEPA by August 30, 2024 (see Note 7). As such, the full unpaid principal
amount of the Yorkville Note may become immediately due and payable at Yorkville s election. The Company subsequently engaged in
discussions with Yorkville regarding these events of default, which discussions are ongoing. 

The
Company elected the FVO of accounting for the Yorkville Note. The estimated fair value adjustment is presented as a single line item
within other expense (income), net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption change in fair
value of Yorkville Note. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Yorkville Note was million, which is included in current

December 31, 2023. If the loan was paid back by January 18, 2024, thousand of the loan would have been forgiven. If the loan was
not paid back by January 18, 2024, the full thousand loan would have been converted to a loan repayable over with a 
interest rate. The loan was paid back prior to January 18, 2024, and the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of thousand,

original share value of million, In January 2024, the Company
issued the original shares of Common Stock as consideration for million owed by the Company. As of September 30, 2024, The promissory note remained unpaid upon maturity on , and the Company recorded
interest expense of thousand and thousand during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, because of

In
February 2024, the Company entered into a stock repurchase agreement with a former holder of Convertible Promissory Notes pursuant to
which the Company repurchased shares of Common Stock in exchange for cash of million that is payable in installments. The
Company made payments of million in July and October 2024 and the remaining million is expected to be repaid in early 2025.
The million represents the principal and accrued interest outstanding on the holder s Convertible Promissory Note immediately
prior to the Business Combination. The million outstanding at September 30, 2024 is classified in accounts payable and accrued expenses
on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The repurchased shares were reclassified to treasury stock as of September 30, 2024. 

Standby
Equity Purchase Agreement 

On
June 17, 2024, the Company and Yorkville entered into the SEPA. Under the SEPA, the Company has the right to sell to Yorkville up to
 million of its Common Stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA, from time to time, over a 24-month
period. Sales of the Common Stock to Yorkville under the SEPA, and the timing of any such sales, are at the Company s option, and
the Company is under no obligation to sell any shares of Common Stock to Yorkville under the SEPA except in connection with notices that
may be submitted by Yorkville, in certain circumstances as described below. 

Upon
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent in the SEPA, which include having a resale shelf for shares of Common Stock issued to Yorkville
declared effective, the Company has the right to direct Yorkville to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock by delivering
written notice (each an Advance ). 

Yorkville
will generally purchase shares pursuant to an Advance at a price per share equal to 97 of the VWAP, on Nasdaq during the three consecutive
trading days commencing on the date of the delivery of the Advance (unless the Company specifies a minimum acceptable price or there
is no VWAP on the subject trading day). 

The
SEPA will automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the first day of the month next following the 24-month anniversary
of the date of the SEPA or (ii) the date on which Yorkville shall have made payment for shares of Common Stock equal to million.
The Company has the right to terminate the SEPA at no cost or penalty upon five trading days prior written notice to Yorkville,
provided that there are no outstanding advances for which shares of Common Stock need to be issued and the Yorkville Note has been paid
in full. The Company and Yorkville may also agree to terminate the SEPA by mutual written consent. 

As
consideration for Yorkville s commitment to purchase the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the SEPA, the Company paid Yorkville
a thousand cash structuring fee. In addition, the Company must pay a commitment fee in shares equal to million. In September
2024, the Company paid an equivalent of the commitment fee by issuing to Yorkville shares of Common Stock. 

In
connection with the entry into the SEPA, on June 17, 2024, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with Yorkville, pursuant
to which the Company agreed to file with the SEC no later than August 30, 2024, a registration statement for the resale by Yorkville
of the shares of Common Stock issued under the SEPA (including the commitment fee shares). The Company agreed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to have such registration statement declared effective within 30 days of such filing and to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement during the 24-month commitment period. The Company will not have the ability to request any Advances under the
SEPA (nor may Yorkville convert the Yorkville Note into Common Stock) until such resale registration statement is declared effective
by the SEC. The Company has not yet filed a registration statement with the SEC for the resale by Yorkville of the shares of Common Stock
issued under the SEPA, which is deemed an event of default under the SEPA and as a result, a payment of million became due on October
15, 2024. The million due includes the outstanding principal of million, accrued and unpaid interest, and a payment premium
of . As described in Note 4, the Company subsequently engaged in discussions with Yorkville regarding the events of default, which
discussions are ongoing. 

The
SEPA was accounted for as a liability under ASC 815 as it includes an embedded put option and an embedded forward option. The put option
is recognized at inception and the forward option is recognized upon issuance of notice for the sale of the Company s Common Stock.
The fair value of the derivative liability related to the embedded put option was estimated at million at the inception of the agreement.
As of September 30, 2024, the embedded put option was determined to have no value because of alternative financing options now available
to the Company making future draws on the SEPA improbable. Further, as described in Note 4, the Company is currently in default on the
SEPA due to its failure to file a registration statement with the SEC for the resale by Yorkville of the shares of Common Stock issuable
under the SEPA by August 30, 2024. As such, no shares can currently be issued under the SEPA. The embedded forward option was also deemed
to have value as there were no notices for the sale of the Company s Common Stock as of September 30, 2024.

Promissory Notes Warrants

described in Note 4, the Company issued Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants in 2022 and 2023. The Convertible Promissory Notes
Warrants are classified as equity in accordance with ASC 815-40. The Company determined that the fair value of the combined
instrument (inclusive of the Convertible Promissory Notes) significantly exceeded the proceeds received; therefore, the Company
concluded that the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants are most accurately portrayed as an issuance cost related to the
Convertible Promissory Notes. This resulted in an expense of million
and million
being allocated to the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively, which is classified as stock warrant expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The
estimated fair values of the PIPE Notes and Yorkville Note are determined based on the aggregated, probability-weighted average of the
outcomes of certain possible scenarios. The combined value of the probability-weighted average of those outcomes is then discounted back
to each reporting period in which the convertible notes are outstanding, in each case, based on a risk-adjusted discount rate estimated
based on the implied discount rate. The discount rate was held constant over the valuation periods given the fact pattern associated

of the Convertible Promissory Notes, the Company also issued Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants to purchase shares of Legacy
ONMD common stock to the same related parties (out of total). The closing of the Business Combination triggered the conversion
of all Convertible Promissory Notes and Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants into shares of Common Stock. See the Form 10-K/A for all

arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recognized, if and when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company was not subject to any material legal proceedings during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Yorkville
Letter 

On
October 8, 2024, Yorkville sent the Company a letter notifying the Company that it had breached a registration rights agreement with
Yorkville by failing to file a Registration Statement on Form S-1 on the timeline set forth in the registration rights agreement (the
 Yorkville Letter ). The Yorkville Letter asserted that this breach was an event of default and an amortization event under
the prepaid advance in connection with the SEPA. The Yorkville Letter also asserted that the Company s failure to timely file its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 was an event of default under the Yorkville Promissory Note.
The Company subsequently engaged in discussions with Yorkville regarding the Yorkville Letter, which discussions are ongoing. 

Pursuant
to the Yorkville Promissory Note, upon the occurrence of an amortization event, the Company is required to pay all principal and accrued
interest on the Yorkville Promissory Note, plus a payment premium on the principal amount, in equal installments over 3 calendar
months or until the amortization event is cured, whichever is earlier. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default, the interest
rate on the Yorkville Promissory Note increases to retroactive to the date of the event of default. 

Board
Turnover

Erkan Akyuz resigned from the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board ), effective immediately. Also on October 1, 2024, the Board appointed Jair Clarke and Sherry
Coonse McCraw to the Board to fill the vacancies created by Mr. Casey and Mr. Akyuz, respectively. In connection with Ms. Coonse

Business
Combination 

On
November 7, 2023, we held the closing of the Business Combination whereby Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy ONMD, with Legacy ONMD
continuing as the surviving entity, which resulted in all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Legacy ONMD being exchanged
for shares of Common Stock upon the terms set forth in the agreement and plan of merger, dated April 25, 2022 (the Merger Agreement ),
by and among Data Knights, Merger Sub, Legacy ONMD, Data Knights, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ),
and Paul Casey, in his capacity as representative of the stockholders of Legacy ONMD. The Business Combination and other transactions
that closed on November 7, 2023, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, led to Data Knights changing its name to OneMedNet Corporation 
and the business of the Company became the business of Legacy ONMD. 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the total consideration for the Business Combination and related transactions (the Merger
Consideration was approximately 200 million. In connection with the special meeting of stockholders of Data Knights, certain
public holders holding 1,600,741 shares of Data Knights common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion
of the funds held by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as trustee in the trust account established in connection with Data
Knights initial public offering. Effective November 7, 2023, Data Knights units ceased trading, and effective November
8, 2023, the Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ONMD and the Public Warrants began
trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ONMDW. The Common Stock and Public Warrants were transferred from
The Nasdaq Global Market to The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on August 19, 2024, and continue to trade under the
symbols ONMD and ONMDW, respectively. 

As

Key
Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations 

Revenue 

The
Company generates revenue from two streams: (1) iRWD, which provides regulatory grade imaging and clinical data in the pharmaceutical,
device manufacturing, contract research organizations, and AI markets and (2) BEAM, which is a medical imaging exchange platform between
hospital/healthcare systems, imaging centers, physicians and patients. iRWD is sold on a fixed fee basis based on the number of data
units and the cost per data unit committed to in the customer contract. Revenue is recognized when the data is delivered to the customer.
BEAM revenue is subscription-based revenue that is recognized ratably over the subscription period committed to by the customer. The
Company invoices its BEAM customers quarterly or annually in advance with the customer contracts automatically renewing unless the customer
issues a cancellation notice. 

The
Company excludes from revenue taxes collected from a customer that are assessed by a governmental authority and imposed on and concurrent
with a specific revenue-producing transaction. The transaction price for the products is the invoiced amount. Advanced billings from
contracts are deferred and recognized as revenue when earned. Deferred revenue consists of payments received in advance of performance
under the contract. Such amounts are generally recognized as revenue over the contractual period. The Company receives payments from
customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Accounts receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.
Payment terms on invoiced amounts typically range from zero to 90 days, with typical terms of 30 days. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Our
cost of revenue is composed of our distinct performance obligations of hosting, labor, and data cost. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative functions include finance, legal, human resources, operations, and information technology support. These functions
include costs for items such as salaries and benefits and other personnel-related costs, maintenance and supplies, professional fees
for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, and depreciation expense. 

Research
and Development 

Costs
incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include personnel,
contracted services, materials, and indirect costs involved in the design and development of new products and services, as well as hosting
expense. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Our
sales and marketing costs consist of labor and tradeshow costs. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense consists of interest incurred on shareholder loans. 

Other
(Income) Expenses, Net 

Other
(income) expenses, net, primarily includes the changes in fair value of convertible debt and change in fair value of PIPE Notes for which
we have elected the fair value option of accounting. Convertible notes payable, which include convertible promissory notes, PIPE Notes
issued to related parties and the Yorkville Note, including accrued interest and contingently issuable warrants, contain embedded derivatives,
including settlement of the contingent conversion features, which require bifurcation and separate accounting. Accordingly, we have elected
to measure the entire contingently convertible debt instruments, including accrued interest, at fair value. These debt instruments were
initially recorded at fair value as liabilities and are subsequently re-measured at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance
sheet at the end of each reporting period and at settlement, as applicable. Other income or expenses, net, also includes changes in fair
value of loan extensions, deferred underwriting fees, Bitcoin and warrants which are treated as liability instruments measured at fair
value for accounting purposes, initially recorded at fair value and subsequently re-measured to fair value on our condensed consolidated
balance sheets at the end of each reporting period. The changes in the fair value of these debt and liability instruments are recorded
in changes in fair value, included as a component of other (income) expenses, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

At
the closing of the Business Combination, convertible promissory notes were converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the Closing
and were no longer outstanding as of the closing date. 

Other
(income) expenses, net, also includes foreign exchange and tax expenses related to the Company s operations and revenue outside
of the United States.

Our
revenue is comprised of sales made from our subscription revenue (BEAM) and from our web imaging (iRWD). For the three months ended September
30, 2024, overall revenue decreased by 56 compared to the prior year period. The primary driver for the subscription revenue decrease
was because of the planned discontinuation of this platform in 2025. As we move away from the BEAM platform to focus on iRWD sales, we
have stopped renewals for most of our customers leading to decreased revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The primary
driver for the web imaging revenue decrease was due to lower deliveries during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased by 69 compared to the prior year
period. The increase is primarily driven by lower overall revenues and higher iRWD consulting costs as we transition away from the BEAM
platform to focus on our iRWD product. 

General
and Administrative 

Our
general and administrative expense increased 0.6 million, or 42 , to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from
 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in professional fees of 1.0
million from being a public company (e.g. higher legal, audit and consulting fees) and salaries and benefits of 0.1 million, which are
partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of 0.6 million and other miscellaneous office expenses of 35 thousand. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Our
sales marketing expense decreased 0.1 million, or 42 , to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.2
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in consulting expenses of 76 thousand
and salaries and benefits of 58 thousand, which are partially offset by increases in software expenses of 17 thousand and dues and
subscriptions of 16 thousand. 

Research
and development 

Our
research and development expense decreased 0.1 million, or 26 , to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.4
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of 56 thousand
and software and hosting expenses of 20 thousand. 

Interest
Expense 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on loans made from related parties
(Management and Directors) and interest expense on the remaining 0.4 million of deferred underwriter fees payable that is payable in
cash. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we did not incur any interest expense. 

Change
in Fair Value of Warrants 

The
change in fair value of Warrants during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the closing of the Business Combination
and the resulting fluctuations in the market price of shares of Common Stock . 

Change
in Fair Value of PIPE Notes 

The
change in fair value of PIPE Notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the closing of the Business
Combination and the resulting fluctuations in the market price of shares of Common Stock . 

Change
in Fair Value of Yorkville Note 

The
change in fair value of Yorkville Note during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the Yorkville Note issued in June
2024 and the resulting fluctuations of the market price of shares of Common Stock. 

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 

The
change in fair value of derivative liability during the three months ended September 30, 2024 relates to the mark-to-market adjustment
of the SEPA put option derivative liability, which was determined to have no value as of September 30, 2024. 

Change
in Fair Value of Bitcoin 

The
change in fair value of Bitcoin during the three months ended September 30, 2024 relates to the mark-to-market adjustment of Bitcoin,
which we began strategically investing in using excess cash from our private placement transactions. During the three months ended September
30, 2023, we did not have any Bitcoin holdings. 

Change
in Fair Value of Convertible Promissory Notes 

The
change in fair value of convertible promissory notes was due to the closing of the Business Combination and the resulting fluctuations
of the market price of shares of Common Stock . The Legacy ONMD Convertible Promissory Notes were converted at the closing of the
Business Combination and were no longer outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Stock
Warrant Expense 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not incur any stock warrant expense. Stock warrant expense during the three months
ended September 30, 2023 was due to the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants, which was most accurately portrayed as an issuance cost
related to the Convertible Promissory Notes .

Our
revenue is comprised of sales made from our subscription revenue (BEAM) and from our web imaging (iRWD). For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, overall revenue decreased by 9 . The primary driver for the decrease in subscription revenue was because of the planned discontinuation
of this platform in 2025. As we move away from the BEAM platform to focus on iRWD sales, we have stopped renewals for most of our customers
leading to an immaterial increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary driver for the web imaging revenue increase
was due to our enhanced focus on iRWD sales leading to increased customer deliveries during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Our
general and administrative expense increased 2.5 million, or 99 , to 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from

million from being a public company (e.g. higher legal, audit and consulting fees), a commitment fee of 0.5 million from the SEPA, salaries
and benefits of 0.2 million, and bad debt expense of 0.1 million, which are partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense

research and development expense decreased 0.4 million, or 28 , to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.5

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from related party investors and private placement transactions
and cash received from customers. 

The
following table shows net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities, net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities,
and net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities during the periods presented:

Operating
Activities 

Our
net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of financial instruments, and as well as changes in operating
assets and liabilities. The primary changes in working capital items, such as the changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue,
result from the difference in timing of payments from our customers related to contract performance obligations. This may result in an
operating cash flow source or use for the period, depending on the timing of payments received as compared to the fulfillment of the
performance obligation. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 5.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities
was due to our net loss of 7.8 million, which is offset by non-cash items of 1.2 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation
of 0.4 million, change in fair value of Yorkville Note of 0.6 million, change in fair value of Bitcoin of 0.1 million, non-cash interest
expense of 0.1 million, and cash from operating assets and liabilities of 1.5 million due to the timing of cash payments to vendors
and cash receipts from customers. 

By
comparison, the Company s net cash used in operating activities was 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to our net loss of 31.3 million, which is
offset by non-cash items of 27.7 million, primarily consisting of the change in fair value of convertible debt of 17.9 million, stock
warrant expense of 8.4 million and stock-based compensation expense of 1.4 million, and cash from operating assets and liabilities
of 0.5 million due to the timing of cash payments to vendors and cash receipts from customers. 

22 

Investing
Activities 

Our
investing activities have consisted primarily of property and equipment purchases and Bitcoin holdings. 

Net
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of a 2.8 million investment
in Bitcoin and 28 thousand of purchased property and equipment, which are partially offset by a 0.5 million sale of Bitcoin. 

Net
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 28 thousand of purchased
property and equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of 6.3
million of net proceeds received from three private placement transactions, 2.0 million of proceeds received from related party loans
(net of 0.2 million of repayments) and 1.4 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the Yorkville Note. These increases are
partially offset by repayments of 0.1 million to settle a portion of our deferred underwriter fees payable and repurchases of Common
Stock. 

By
comparison, the Company s net cash provided by financing activities was 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, which primarily consisted of 3.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, and 0.7 million of
proceeds received from related party loans, offset by 1.2 million of Business Combination costs paid. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments and Going Concern Outlook 

Currently,
management does not believe that our cash and cash equivalents is sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next
12 months. Our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating expenses, include our expected capital expenditures to
support the expansion of our infrastructure and workforce, interest expense and minimum contractual obligations. Management intends to
raise cash for operations through debt and equity offerings. As a result of the Company s recurring loss from operations and the
need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements there is uncertainty regarding the Company s ability
to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research
and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings,
and the cost of any future acquisitions of technology or businesses. In the event that additional financing is required from outside
sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and
judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenue, results of operations, and net income or loss, as well as on the
value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet during and as of the reporting periods. These estimates, assumptions, and
judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results of operations and the value of our assets cannot be determined
with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties,
the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Because the use of estimates is
inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

23 

For
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations in the Form 10-K/A, the notes to our audited financial statements appearing in the Form 10-K/A, and the notes to
the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report. Except as described in this Report, there have been no material changes to these critical accounting policies
and estimates through September 30, 2024 from those discussed in the Form 10-K/A. 

Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

A
description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations
is disclosed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that
as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of material weaknesses in our internal controls
over financial reporting which were not designed properly to ensure proper identification of non-routine transactions and ensure appropriate
segregation of duties. 

Material
Weaknesses 

As
disclosed elsewhere in this Report, we completed the Business Combination on November 7, 2023. Prior to the Business Combination, Data
Knights, our predecessor, was a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. As a result, previously
existing internal controls are no longer applicable or comprehensive enough as of the assessment date, because Data Knights operations
prior to the Business Combination were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated entity post-Business Combination. As a result,
management is aware of material weaknesses in the Company s internal control related to user access/segregation of duties, lack
of a formalized control environment and oversight of controls over financial reporting, errors in accounting for non-routine transactions,
and lack of record keeping. Due to the limited transactional volume currently experienced combined with our financial limitations, we
do not currently have an expanded accounting department that would allow us to better segregate duties. Over time, as we continue to
grow and add accounting staff, we expect to continue to enhance our internal control structure, including appropriate segregation of
duties. During September 2024, changes were made to accounting personnel to enhance our financial reporting structure, which we expect
to alleviate reporting pressures, including reporting of non-routine transactions. In addition, the new personnel has focused on creating
central filing repositories to manage accounting records and other company documents. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

We
may be subject from time to time to various claims, lawsuits and other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course
of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties,
and could result in damages, fines, penalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. We are not presently party to any legal proceedings
that, in the opinion of management, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect
on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the Risk Factors 
in the Form 10-K/A and our other public filings, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there
have been no material changes from risk factors previously disclosed in Risk Factors in the Form 10-K/A and our other public
filings. 

The
value of Bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in Bitcoin and do not
intend to for the foreseeable future, we are directly exposed to Bitcoin s price volatility and surrounding risks. 

While
Bitcoin prices are determined primarily using data from
various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms, they have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety
of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the worldwide growth in the adoption and use of Bitcoins, the maintenance and
development of the software protocol of the Bitcoin network, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes, fraudulent or illegitimate
actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Furthermore, pricing may be the result of,
and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of Bitcoin, or our share price, making prices more
volatile. 

Currently,
we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell Bitcoin that we hold, or the number of Bitcoins
we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell Bitcoins are currently determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring
the market in real time. Such decisions, however well-informed, may result in untimely sales and even losses, adversely affecting an
investment in us. At this time, we do not anticipate engaging in any hedging activities related to our holding of Bitcoin; this would
expose us to substantial decreases in the price of Bitcoin. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have sales of unregistered securities not previously included in a Current Report
on Form 8-K. 

Item
3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

None. 

Item
4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 

Not
applicable. 

Item
5. Other Information. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement 
or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.

Exhibit 10.8 

OneMedNet
Corporation 

Compensation
Recovery Policy 

(Adopted
November 6, 2024) 

The
Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to adopt this Policy enabling the Company to
recover from specified current and former Company executives certain incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement
resulting from material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws. Capitalized terms
are defined in Section 13. 

This
Policy is designed to comply with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall apply to
Incentive-Based Compensation Received by Covered Persons on or after the Listing Rule Effective Date. 

1. Administration 

This
Policy shall be administered by the Administrator. The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make
all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. The Administrator may retain, at the Company s
expense, outside legal counsel and such compensation, tax or other consultants as it may determine are advisable for purposes of administering
this Policy. 

2. Covered
 Persons and Applicable Compensation 

This
Policy applies to any Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person (a) after beginning service as a Covered Person; (b) who served
as a Covered Person at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation; and (c) was a Covered Person during
the Clawback Period. 

However,
recovery is not required with respect to: 

i. Incentive-Based
 Compensation Received prior to an individual becoming a Covered Person, even if the individual
 served as a Covered Person during the Clawback Period. 

ii. Incentive-Based
 Compensation Received prior to the Listing Rule Effective Date. 

iii. Incentive-Based
 Compensation Received prior to the Clawback Period. 

iv. Incentive-Based
 Compensation Received while the Company did not have a class of listed securities on a national
 securities exchange or a national securities association, including the Exchange. 

The
Administrator will not consider the Covered Person s responsibility or fault or lack thereof in enforcing this Policy with respect
to recoupment under the Final Rules. 

3. Triggering
 Event 

Subject
to and in accordance with the provisions of this Policy, if there is a Triggering Event, the Administrator shall require a Covered Person
to reimburse or forfeit to the Company the Recoupment Amount applicable to such Covered Person. A Company s obligation to recover
the Recoupment Amount is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed. 

4. Calculation
 of Recoupment Amount 

The
Recoupment Amount will be calculated in accordance with the Final Rules, as provided in the Calculation Guidelines attached hereto as
 Exhibit A . 

5. Method
 of Recoupment 

Subject
to compliance with the Final Rules and applicable law, the Administrator will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping
the Recoupment Amount hereunder which may include, without limitation: 

i. Requiring
 reimbursement or forfeiture of the pre-tax amount of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously
 paid; 

ii. Offsetting
 the Recoupment Amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered
 Person, including without limitation, any prior cash incentive payments, executive retirement
 benefits, wages, equity grants or other amounts payable by the Company to the Covered Person
 in the future; 

iii. Seeking
 recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, cash sale, transfer,
 or other disposition of any equity-based awards; and/or 

iv. Taking
 any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Administrator. 

6. Arbitration 

To
the fullest extent permitted by law, any disputes under this Policy shall be submitted to mandatory binding arbitration (the Arbitrable
Claims ), governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (the FAA ). Further, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, no class or collective actions can be asserted in arbitration or otherwise. All claims, whether in arbitration or otherwise,
must be brought solely in the Covered Person s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class
or collective proceeding. 

SUBJECT
TO THE ABOVE PROVISO, ANY RIGHTS THAT A COVERED PERSON MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN REGARD TO ARBITRABLE CLAIMS ARE WAIVED. ANY RIGHTS
THAT A COVERED PERSON MAY HAVE TO PURSUE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIMS BETWEEN A COVERED PERSON
AND THE COMPANY ARE WAIVED. 

2 

The
Covered Person is not restricted from filing administrative claims that may be brought before any government agency where, as a matter
of law, the Covered Person s ability to file such claims may not be restricted. However, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for the subject matter of such administrative claims. The arbitration shall be conducted in
San Jose, California through JAMS before a single neutral arbitrator, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures then in effect, provided however, that the FAA, including its procedural provisions for compelling arbitration, shall govern
and apply to this Arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall issue a written decision that contains the essential findings and conclusions
on which the decision is based. If, for any reason, any term of this Arbitration provision is held to be invalid or unenforceable, all
other valid terms and conditions herein shall be severable in nature and remain fully enforceable. 

7. Recovery
 Process; Impracticability 

Actions
by the Administrator to recover the Recoupment Amount will be reasonably prompt. 

The
Administrator must cause the Company to recover the Recoupment Amount unless the Administrator shall have previously determined that
recovery is impracticable and one of the following conditions is met: 

i. The
 direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the
 amount to be recovered; before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount
 of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the
 Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded Incentive-Based
 Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation
 to the Exchange; 

ii. Recovery
 would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; before
 concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based
 Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company must obtain an opinion of
 home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation,
 and must provide such opinion to the Exchange; or 

iii. Recovery
 would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly
 available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13)
 or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 

8. Non-Exclusivity 

The
Administrator intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. Without limitation to any broader or alternate
clawback authorized in any written document with a Covered Person, (i) the Administrator may require that any employment agreement, equity
award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder,
require a Covered Person to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, and (ii) this Policy will nonetheless apply to Incentive-Based
Compensation as required by the Final Rules, whether or not specifically referenced in those arrangements. Any right of recoupment under
this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant
to the terms of any other clawback policy of the Company as then in effect, or any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity
award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies or regulations available or applicable to the Company (including SOX
304). If recovery is required under both SOX 304 and this Policy, any amounts recovered pursuant to SOX 304 may, in the Administrator s
discretion, be credited toward the amount recovered under this Policy, or vice versa. 

3 

9. No
 Indemnification 

The
Company shall not indemnify any Covered Persons against (i) the loss of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation or any adverse
tax consequences associated with any incorrectly awarded Incentive-Based Compensation or any recoupment hereunder, or (ii) any claims
relating to the Company enforcement of its rights under this Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, this prohibition on indemnification
will also prohibit the Company from reimbursing or paying any premium or payment of any third-party insurance policy to fund potential
recovery obligations obtained by the Covered Person directly. No Covered Person will seek or retain any such prohibited indemnification
or reimbursement. 

Further,
the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-Based Compensation from the application of this Policy or that
waives the Company s right to recovery of any erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation and this Policy shall supersede
any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date). 

10. Successors 

This
Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Persons and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other
legal representatives and shall inure to the benefit of any successor to the Company. 

11. Interpretation
 of Policy 

To
the extent there is any ambiguity between this Policy and the Final Rules, this Policy shall be interpreted so that it complies with
the Final Rules. If any provision of this Policy, or the application of such provision to any Covered Person or circumstance, shall be
held invalid, the remainder of this Policy, or the application of such provision to Covered Persons or circumstances other than those
as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby. 

In
the event any provision of this Policy is inconsistent with any requirement of any Final Rules, the Administrator, in its sole discretion,
shall amend and administer this Policy and bring it into compliance with such rules. 

Any
determination under this Policy by the Administrator shall be conclusive and binding on the applicable Covered Person. Determinations
of the Administrator need not be uniform with respect to Covered Persons or from one payment or grant to another. 

4

6 

EXHIBIT
A 

Calculation
Guidelines 

For
purposes of calculating the Recoupment Amount: 

i. For
 cash awards not paid from bonus pools, the erroneously awarded compensation is the difference
 between the amount of the cash award (whether payable as a lump sum or over time) that was
 received and the amount that should have been received applying the restated Financial Reporting
 Measure. 

ii. For
 cash awards paid from bonus pools, the erroneously awarded compensation is the pro rata portion
 of any deficiency that results from the aggregate bonus pool that is reduced based on applying
 the restated Financial Reporting Measure. 

iii. For
 equity awards, if the shares, options, restricted stock units, or SARs are still held at
 the time of recovery, the erroneously awarded compensation is the number of such securities
 received in excess of the number that should have been received applying the restated Financial
 Reporting Measure (or the value of that excess number). If the options or SARs have been
 exercised, but the underlying shares have not been sold, the erroneously awarded compensation
 is the number of shares underlying the excess options or SARs (or the value thereof). If
 the underlying shares have been sold, the Company may recoup proceeds received from the sale
 of shares. 

iv. For
 Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or TSR, where the amount of erroneously
 awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information
 in an accounting restatement: 

a. The
 amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement
 on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received; and 

b. The
 Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and
 the Company must provide such documentation to the Exchange in all cases.
