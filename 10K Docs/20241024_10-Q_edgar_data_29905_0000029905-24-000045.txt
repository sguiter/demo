to days and vary by the location of businesses, the type of products manufactured to be sold and the volume of products sold, among other factors. 
 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 Revenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated by segment and geographic location, as they best depict the nature and amount of the Company s revenue. See Note 16 Segment Information for further details. 
 
 Performance Obligations 
 
 Approximately of the Company s revenue is recognized at a point in time, rather than over time as the Company completes its performance obligations. Specifically, revenue is recognized when control transfers to the customer, typically upon shipment or completion of installation, testing, certification, or other substantive acceptance provisions required under the contract. Approximately of the Company s revenue is recognized over time and relates to the sale of equipment or services, including software solutions and services, in which the Company transfers control of a good or service over time and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the Company performs, or the Company's performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or the Company's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for its performance to date plus a reasonable margin. 
 
 A majority of the Company's contracts have a single performance obligation which represents, in most cases, the equipment or product being sold to the customer. Some contracts include multiple performance obligations such as a product and the related

 in revenue is expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period. We expect to recognize approximately of the Company's unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations as revenue through 2025, in 2026, with the remaining balance to be recognized in 2027 and thereafter. 
 
 The Company applied the standard's practical expedient that permits the omission of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed. 
 
 Contract Balances 
 
 Contract assets primarily relate to the Company's right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract liabilities relate to advance consideration received from customers or advance billings for which revenue has not been recognized and are reduced when the associated revenue from the contract is recognized. 
 
 Contract liabilities - current Contract liabilities - non-current 
 
 The revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that was included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period amounted to and , respectively.

 On April 6, 2023, the Company entered into a billion unsecured revolving credit facility and on April 4, 2024, the Company entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit facility (together, the "Credit Agreements") with a syndicate of banks. The current credit facility replaced the previous million credit facility, which expired on April 4, 2024. The lenders' commitments under the Credit Agreements will terminate and any outstanding loans under the Credit Agreements will mature on April 6, 2028 and April 3, 2025, respectively. The Company may elect to extend the maturity date of any loans under the new credit facility until April 3, 2026, subject to conditions specified therein. The Credit Agreements are designated as a liquidity back-stop for the Company's commercial paper program and also are available for general corporate purposes. At the Company's election, loans under the Credit Agreements will bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin. The Credit Agreements require the Company to pay facility fees and impose various restrictions on the Company such as, among other things, a requirement to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than to 1. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were outstanding borrowings under the , current or previous credit facilities. 
 
 The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreements and other long-term debt covenants at September 30, 2024 and had an interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of to 1. 
 
 Letters of Credit and other Guarantees 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million outstanding in letters of credit, surety bonds, and performance and other guarantees which primarily expire on various dates through 2035. These letters of credit and bonds are primarily issued as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which is believed to be remote.

 In addition, the Company had outstanding contracts with a total notional amount of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, that are not designated as hedging instruments.

 For a cash flow hedge, the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss), net of tax as a separate component of the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and is reclassified into revenues or cost of goods and services in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings during the period in which the hedged transaction is settled. The amount of gains or losses from hedging activity recorded in earnings is not significant, and the amount of unrealized gains and losses from cash flow hedges that are expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months is not significant; therefore, additional tabular disclosures are not presented. There are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and the Company's derivative instruments that are subject to credit risk contingent features were not significant. 
 
 The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as the Company s policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties. 
 
 The Company has designated the and of euro-denominated notes issued November 9, 2016 and November 4, 2019, respectively, as hedges of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated operations. Changes in the value of the euro-denominated debt are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive earnings (loss) of the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings to offset changes in the value of the net investment in euro-denominated operations. Changes in the value of the euro-denominated debt resulting from exchange rate differences are offset by changes in the net investment due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged. ) Tax (expense) benefit

 The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each SAR on the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on Dover's stock price history, including implied volatilities from traded options on Dover stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate SAR exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of SARs granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the awards is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The PSAs granted in 2024 vest based on the attainment of two equally weighted measures: (i) Dover s performance relative to established internal metrics (performance condition) and (ii) Dover's performance relative to its peer group (companies listed under the S P 500 Industrials sector; market condition). 
 
 The grant date fair value of the performance condition portion is determined using Dover s closing stock price at the date of grant and the amount of expense recognized over the vesting period is subject to adjustment based on the expected attainment of the performance condition. The fair value per share at the date of grant for the 2024 performance condition portion is . 
 
 The grant date fair value of the 2024 market condition portion, and all 2023 PSAs, is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The amount of expense recognized over the vesting period is not subject to change based on future market conditions.

 On February 29, 2024, the Company entered into a accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR Agreement") with Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank") to repurchase its shares in an accelerated share repurchase program (the "ASR Program"). The ASR Program is classified as equity, initially recorded at fair value with no subsequent remeasurement. The Company conducted the ASR Program under the current share repurchase authorization. The Company funded the ASR Program with proceeds from commercial paper. 
 
 Under the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company paid Citibank on March 1, 2024 and on that date received initial delivery of shares, representing a substantial majority of the shares expected to be retired over the course of the ASR Agreement. In July 2024, Citibank delivered additional shares which completed the ASR Program. During 2024, the Company received a total of shares upon completion of the ASR Agreement. The total number of shares ultimately repurchased under the ASR Agreement was based on the volume-weighted average share price of Dover's common stock during the calculation period of the ASR Program, less a discount, which was over the term of the ASR Program. 
 
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, exclusive of the ASR Program, there were share repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, shares remain authorized for repurchase under the August 2023 share repurchase authorization.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Refer to the section below entitled "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained below and throughout this quarterly report. 
 
 Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A"), we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Please see "Non-GAAP Disclosures" at the end of this Item 2 for further detail on these financial measures. We believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends. Reconciliations within this MD A provide more details on the use and derivation of these measures. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 Dover is a diversified global manufacturer and solutions provider delivering innovative equipment and components, consumable supplies, aftermarket parts, software and digital solutions, and support services through five operating segments: Engineered Products, Clean Energy Fueling, Imaging Identification, Pumps Process Solutions, and Climate Sustainability Technologies. The Company's entrepreneurial business model encourages, promotes and fosters deep customer engagement and collaboration, which has led to Dover's well-established and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industry-leading product innovation. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to "Dover," "the Company," and words such as "we," "us," or "our" include Dover Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Dover's five operating segments are as follows: 
 
 Our Engineered Products segment provides a wide range of equipment, components, software, solutions and services to the vehicle aftermarket, aerospace and defense, industrial winch and hoist, and fluid dispensing end-markets. 
 
 Our Clean Energy Fueling segment provides components, equipment, software solutions and services enabling safe and reliable storage, transport and dispensing of traditional and clean fuels (including liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, and electric vehicle charging), cryogenic gases, and other hazardous substances along the supply chain, and safe and efficient operation of convenience retail, retail fueling and vehicle wash establishments. 
 
 Our Imaging Identification segment supplies precision marking and coding, product traceability, brand protection and digital textile printing equipment, as well as related consumables, software and services to the global packaged and consumer goods, pharmaceutical, industrial manufacturing, textile and other end-markets. 
 
 Our Pumps Process Solutions segment manufactures specialty pumps and flow meters, fluid transfer connectors, highly engineered precision components, instruments and digital controls for rotating and reciprocating machines, polymer processing equipment, serving single-use biopharmaceutical production, diversified industrial manufacturing applications, chemical production, plastics and polymer processing, midstream and downstream oil and gas, clean energy markets, thermal management, food and beverage, semiconductor production and medical applications and other end-markets. 
 
 Our Climate Sustainability Technologies segment is a provider of innovative and energy-efficient equipment, components and parts for the commercial refrigeration, heating and cooling and beverage can-making equipment end-markets. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, revenue was 2.0 billion, which increased 25.1 million, or 1.3 , as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This was driven by acquisition-related revenue growth of 3.8 and organic revenue growth of 0.3 , partially offset by disposition-related decline of 2.7 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.1 . The results were driven by solid demand across most end markets and strategic pricing initiatives. 
 
 The 0.3 organic revenue growth for the third quarter of 2024 was driven by our Engineered Products, Imaging Identification and Pumps Process Solutions segments which grew 12.1 , 3.3 , and 1.9 , respectively. The growth was partially offset by the Climate Sustainability Technologies and Clean Energy Fueling segments which declined 9.4 and 1.2 , respectively. For further information, see "Segment Results of Operations" within this Item 2.

Table of Contents 

 From a geographic perspective, organic revenue for the U.S., our largest market, increased 8.4 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year comparable quarter, driven by broad-based growth across all segments. Organic revenue increased for Other Americas by 1.7 , and decreased for Asia and Europe by 9.5 and 4.6 , respectively. 
 
 Bookings were 1.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.1 billion, or 5.6 compared to the prior year comparable quarter. Included in this result was organic growth of 5.1 and acquisition-related growth of 3.5 , partially offset by disposition-related decline of 2.9 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.1 . The organic bookings growth was primarily driven by positive demand trends and order timing. 
 
 Restructuring and other costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 16.6 million which included restructuring charges of 13.8 million and other costs of 2.7 million. Restructuring and other costs were generally related to exit costs and headcount reductions in the Clean Energy Fueling segment. For further discussion related to our restructuring and other costs, see "Restructuring and Other Costs (Benefits)," within this Item 2. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed four business acquisitions for approximately 460.5 million, subject to post-closing adjustments and inclusive of contingent consideration. See Note 3 Acquisitions in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, a minority owned equity method investment held within the Climate Sustainability Technologies segment was sold and the Company received its proportionate share of the proceeds amounting to 92,962 which resulted in a preliminary pre-tax gain of 68,712, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. See Note 4 Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 On October 8, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced sale of the Environmental Solutions Group ("ESG") business, an operating company within the Engineered Products segment, for total consideration, net of cash transferred, of 2.0 billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the results of ESG are presented as discontinued operations as the sale represents a strategic shift in operations with a major impact on our operations and financial results. See Note 4 Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. The discussion in this MD A, unless otherwise noted, relates solely to our continuing operations. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received a total of 2,869,282 shares upon completion of the accelerated repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement"). The total number of shares ultimately repurchased under the ASR Agreement was based on the volume-weighted average share price of Dover's common stock during the calculation period of the accelerated share repurchase program (the "ASR Program"), less a discount, which was 174.26 over the term of the ASR Program. 
 
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, exclusive of the ASR Program, there were no share repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, 17,130,718 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the August 2023 share repurchase authorization.

 Revenue 
 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 25.1 million, or 1.3 , from the prior year comparable quarter. The increase in revenue was driven by acquisition-related growth of 3.8 and organic revenue growth of 0.3 , partially offset by disposition-related decline of 2.7 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.1 . Customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 1.6 in the third quarter of 2024 and by 3.2 in the prior year comparable quarter. 
 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 36.4 million, or 0.6 , from the prior year comparable period. The increase primarily reflects an acquisition-related growth of 2.8 and organic revenue remained flat. This increase was partially offset by a disposition-related decline of 1.8 and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.4 . Customer pricing favorably impacted revenue by approximately 1.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and by 4.3 in the prior year comparable period.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 26.7 million, or 6.6 , from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily driven by increased employee compensation and benefits and acquisition-related amortization costs. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 110 basis points as compared to the prior year comparable quarter to 21.7 . 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 67.4 million, or 5.5 , from the prior year comparable period, primarily driven by increased employee compensation and benefits, acquisition-related amortization costs and computer software costs, partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 100 basis points as compared to the prior year comparable period to 22.4 . 
 
 Research and development costs, including qualifying engineering costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to 35.6 million and 34.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 108.0 million and 105.1 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The costs as a percentage of revenue are 1.8 and 1.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Gain on Dispositions 
 
 Gain on dispositions of 597.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the sale of the De-Sta-Co business on March 31, 2024 and the sale of a minority owned equity investment on September 30, 2024. See Note 4 Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details.

 Other income, net includes non-service pension benefit, deferred compensation plan investments gain or loss, earnings or charges from equity method investments, foreign exchange gain or loss, and various other items. Other income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.8 million and 12.3 million, respectively, from the comparable prior period primarily driven by an increase in equity earnings and gain on deferred compensation plan investments. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 19.0 and 17.7 , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior year comparable quarter was primarily driven by a gain on disposition. 
 
 The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 20.1 and 18.7 , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior year comparable period was primarily driven by the gains on dispositions. 
 
 The Company is monitoring the changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. We do not expect this to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.

 Discontinued Operations 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the historical results of ESG were presented as discontinued operations as the sale represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on our operations and financial results. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, earnings from discontinued operations, net were 34.2 million and 99.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, earnings from discontinued operations, net were 27.8 million and 74.9 million, respectively. 

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our five reportable operating segments (Engineered Products, Clean Energy Fueling, Imaging Identification, Pumps Process Solutions, and Climate Sustainability Technologies). Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple markets. We evaluate our operating segment performance based on segment earnings as defined in Note 16 Segment Information in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 We report organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. See "Non-GAAP Disclosures" at the end of this Item 2. 
 
 Additionally, we use the following operational metrics in monitoring the performance of the business. We believe the operational metrics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in assessing the performance of our segments: 
 
 Bookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period and exclude de-bookings related to orders received in prior periods, if any. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of order trends. 
 
 Organic bookings represent bookings excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends. 
 
 Book-to-bill is a ratio of the amount of bookings received from customers during a period divided by the amount of revenue recorded during that same period. This metric is a useful indicator of demand.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions. 
 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 
 The following table is derived from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Cash Flows from Operations (in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Net cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 648,881 720,982 Investing activities 63,119 (131,072) Financing activities (818,445) (757,205) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 72.1 million compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to tax payments related to the gain from the De-Sta-Co divestiture. 
 
 Adjusted Working Capital: We believe adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as receivables, plus inventory, less accounts payable) provides a meaningful measure of liquidity by showing changes caused by operational results. The following table provides a calculation of adjusted working capital: 
 
 Adjusted Working Capital (in thousands) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Receivables, net 
 1,428,961 1,321,107 Inventories, net 
 1,214,268 1,144,089 Less: Accounts payable 865,188 854,465 Adjusted working capital 1,778,041 1,610,731 
 
 Adjusted working capital increased by 167.3 million, or 10.4 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reflected an increase of 107.9 million in receivables, net, an increase of 70.2 million in inventory, net and an increase in accounts payable of 10.7 million. These amounts include the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency translation. The increase in adjusted working capital versus year-end 2023 is primarily a result of timing of cash flows, with the fourth quarter traditionally representing our highest cash flow quarter. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash flow from investing activities is derived from cash inflows from proceeds from dispositions, offset by cash outflows for acquisitions and capital expenditures. The majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following: 
 
 Proceeds from dispositions: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of 767.7 million from the sales of De-Sta-Co, an operating company within the Engineered Products segment, and a minority owned equity method investment within Climate Sustainability Technologies segment. There were no proceeds from disposition during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 4 Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 Acquisitions: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we deployed approximately 602.7 million, net, to acquire seven businesses. In comparison, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we deployed approximately 7.2 million, net to acquire one business. See Note 3 Acquisitions in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details.

Table of Contents 

Capital spending: Capital expenditures decreased 12.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in line with our planned capital expenditures for the year. 
 
 We anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make through the remainder of 2024 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, or by accessing the public debt or equity markets. We estimate capital expenditures in 2024 to range from 145.0 million to 155.0 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity. The majority of financing activity was attributed to the following: 
 
 Repurchase of common stock, including accelerated share repurchase program: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received a total of 2,869,282 shares upon completion the ASR Agreement for 500.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased no shares. See Note 17 Stockholders' Equity in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, net: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used 89.0 million and 528.8 million, respectively, to pay off commercial paper borrowings. 
 
 Dividend payments: Total dividend payments to common shareholders were 212.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 212.9 million during the same period in 2023. Our dividends paid per common share increased 1.0 to 1.54 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.52 during the same period in 2023. The number of common shares outstanding decreased from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, as share repurchases exceeded share issuances. 
 
 Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations 
 
 Our cash flows from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, generated 93.9 million and 93.8 million, respectively, representing the operating results of ESG during the periods presented. Cash flows from discontinued operations generated for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily relate to cash provided by operations of approximately 108.3 million, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of 14.4 million, which comprised capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from a sale of investment. Cash flows generated for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily relate to cash provided by operating activities of 99.3 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of 5.5 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 In addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We believe that free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that may be available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock.

 The following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities: Nine Months Ended September 30, Free Cash Flow (dollars in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Cash flow provided by operating activities 648,881 720,982 Less: Capital expenditures (113,626) (126,131) Free cash flow 535,255 594,851 Cash flow from operating activities as a percentage of revenue 11.2 12.5 Cash flow from operating activities as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations 
 55.9 105.1 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 9.2 10.3 Free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations 
 46.1 86.8 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated free cash flow of 535.3 million, representing 9.2 of revenue and 46.1 of earnings from continuing operations. Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 59.6 million, compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to tax payments on the De-Sta-Co gain of 80.0 million, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. The remainder of the tax payments on the De-Sta-Co gain will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2024. The decreases in cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow as percentages of earnings from continuing operations are due primarily to the gain on sale of De-Sta-Co. See Note 4 Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 Capitalization 
 
 We use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we maintained 1.0 billion five-year and 500.0 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facilities (together, the "Credit Agreements") with a syndicate of banks which expire April 6, 2028 and April 3, 2025 , respectively. The Credit Agreements are designated as a liquidity back-stop for the Company's commercial paper program and also are available for general corporate purposes. 
 
 At the Company's election, loans under the Credit Agreements will bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin. The Credit Agreements require the Company to pay facility fees and impose various restrictions on the Company such as, among other things, a requirement to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreements and other long-term debt covenants at September 30, 2024 and had an interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of 20.7 to 1. We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Additionally, our earliest long-term debt maturity i s in 2025. 
 
 We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale, totaled 396.8 million, of which approximately 251.9 million was held outside the United States. At December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale, totaled 415.9 million, of which approximately 286.9 million was held outside the United States. Cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks. We regularly hold cash in excess of near-term requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months. 
 
 On March 31, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the De-Sta-Co business for total consideration, net of cash transferred, of 674.7 million. On September 30, 2024, a minority owned equity method investment held within the Climate Sustainability Technologies segment was sold and the Company received its proportionate share of the proceeds amounting to 93.0 million. On October 8, the Company completed the previously announced sale of the ESG business, an operating company in the Engineered Products segment, for total consideration, net of cash transferred, of 2.0 billion, subject to

 customary post-closing adjustments. See Note 4 Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed seven business acquisitions for total consideration of 636.4 million, subject to post-closing adjustments and inclusive of contingent consideration. See Note 3 Acquisitions in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 We utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. The following table provides a calculation of net debt to net capitalization from the most directly comparable GAAP measures: 
 
 Net Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio 
 (dollars in thousands) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Commercial paper 378,600 467,600 Other 695 682 Total short-term borrowings 379,295 468,282 Long-term debt 3,007,820 2,991,759 Total debt 3,387,115 3,460,041 Less: Cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale 
 (396,766) (415,861) Net debt 2,990,349 3,044,180 Add: Stockholders' equity 5,697,999 5,106,605 Net capitalization 8,688,348 8,150,785 Net debt to net capitalization 34.4 37.3 
 
 Our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 34.4 at September 30, 2024 compared to 37.3 at December 31, 2023. Net debt decreased 53.8 million during the period primarily due to net proceeds from the sale of De-Sta-Co that were used to reduce our commercial paper borrowings. Stockholders' equity increased for the period as a result of current earnings of 1,261.1 million, partially offset by share repurchases under the ASR program and dividends paid during the period. 
 
 Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, purchase obligations, and lease obligations. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. 
 
 We believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of GAAP which requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk and our financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis. 
 
 Recent Accounting Standards 
 
 See Note 19 Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. The adoption of recent accounting standards as included in Note 19 Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the condensed consolidated financial statements has not had, and is not expected to have, a significant impact on our revenue, earnings or liquidity.

 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, especially MD A, contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. All statements in this document other than statements of historical fact are statements that are, or could be deemed, "forward-looking" statements. Some of these statements may be indicated by words such as "may", "anticipate", "expect", "believe", "intend", "continue", "guidance", "estimates", "suggest", "will", "plan", "should", "would", "could", "forecast" and other words and terms that use the future tense or have a similar meaning. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to numerous important risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things: general economic conditions and conditions in the particular markets in which we operate; supply chain constraints and labor shortages that could result in production stoppages, inflation in material input costs and freight logistics; the impacts of natural or human induced disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflicts, and public health crises or other future pandemics on the global economy and on our customers, suppliers, employees, business and cash flows; changes in customer demand and capital spending; competitive factors and pricing pressures; our ability to develop and launch new products in a cost-effective manner; changes in law, including the effect of tax laws and developments with respect to trade policy and tariffs; our ability to identify and complete acquisitions and integrate and realize synergies from newly acquired businesses; the impact of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; capital allocation plans and changes in those plans, including with respect to dividends, share repurchases, investments in research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions; our ability to derive expected benefits from restructurings, productivity initiatives and other cost reduction actions; the impact of legal compliance risks and litigation, including with respect to product quality and safety, cybersecurity and privacy; and our ability to capture and protect intellectual property rights, and various other factors that are described in our periodic reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 
 
 The Company may, from time to time, post financial or other information on its website, www.dovercorporation.com. The website is for informational purposes only and is not intended for use as a hyperlink. The Company is not incorporating any material on its website into this report. 
 
 Non-GAAP Disclosures 
 
 In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we also disclose non-GAAP information, which we believe provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, working capital or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Free cash flow and free cash flow ratios provide both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase our common stock. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations equals free cash flow divided by earnings from continuing operations. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital provides a meaningful measure of liquidity by showing changes caused by operational results. We believe that reporting organic revenue growth provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods. 
 
 Reconciliations and comparisons to non-GAAP measures can be found above in this Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
