Holders of Shares of the Trust may redeem their Shares at any time acting through an Authorized Participant and in the prescribed aggregations of Shares provided , that redemptions of Shares may be suspended during any period while regular trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, or in which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of silver is not reasonably practicable. 
 
 The per Share amount of silver exchanged for a purchase or redemption represents the per Share amount of silver held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities. 
 
 When silver bullion is exchanged in settlement of a redemption, it is considered a sale of silver bullion for accounting purposes.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10 Q. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, should, could, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses made by the Sponsor on the basis of its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor s expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed below, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Although the Sponsor does not make forward-looking statements unless it believes it has a reasonable basis for doing so, the Sponsor cannot guarantee their accuracy. Except as required by applicable disclosure laws, neither the Trust nor the Sponsor is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to a change in the Sponsor s expectations or predictions. 
 
 Introduction 
 
 The iShares Silver Trust (the Trust is a grantor trust formed under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust does not have any officers, directors, or employees, and is administered by The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee acting as trustee pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Depositary Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement between the Trustee and iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor ). The Trust issues units of beneficial interest Shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of silver bullion held by a custodian as an agent of the Trust responsible only to the Trustee. 
 
 The Trust is a passive investment vehicle and seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of silver. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of silver. 
 
 The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in exchange for silver, only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares (a Basket or integral multiples thereof, and only in transactions with registered broker-dealers that have previously entered into an agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee governing the terms and conditions of such issuance (such broker-dealers, the Authorized Participants ). A list of the current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee. 
 
 Shares of the Trust trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. under the ticker symbol SLV. 
 
 Valuation of Silver Bullion Computation of Net Asset Value 
 
 On each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Trustee evaluates the silver held by the Trust and determines the net asset value of the Trust and net asset value per Share NAV ). The Trustee values the silver held by the Trust using the price per ounce of silver determined in an electronic auction hosted by ICE Benchmark Administration IBA that begins at 12:00 p.m. (London time) and published shortly thereafter, on the day the valuation takes place (such price, the LBMA Silver Price ). If there is no announced LBMA Silver Price on any day, the Trustee is authorized to use the most recently announced LBMA Silver Price unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. The LBMA Silver Price is used by the Trust because it is commonly used by the U.S. silver market as an indicator of the value of silver and is permitted to be used under the Trust Agreement. The use of an indicator of the value of silver bullion other than the LBMA Silver Price could result in materially different fair value pricing of the silver held by the Trust, and as such, could result in different cost or market adjustments or in different redemption value adjustments of the outstanding redeemable capital Shares. Having valued the silver held by the Trust, the Trustee then subtracts all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the silver and other assets held by the Trust. The result is the net asset value of the Trust. The Trustee computes NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding on the date the computation is made. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for a fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s fee. The Trust s only source of liquidity is its sales of silver. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies. A description of the valuation of silver bullion, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important to understanding its results of operations and financial position, is provided in the section entitled Valuation of Silver Bullion Computation of Net Asset Value above. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report for further discussion of the Trust s accounting policies.

Results of Operations 
 
 The Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 The Trust s net asset value increased from 12,842,620,288 at June 30, 2024 to 14,574,601,678 at September 30, 2024, a 13.49 increase. The increase in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 478,800,000 Shares at June 30, 2024 to 514,200,000 Shares at September 30, 2024, a consequence of 85,150,000 Shares (1,703 Baskets) being created and 49,750,000 Shares (995 Baskets) being redeemed during the quarter. The increase in the Trust s net asset value also benefitted from an increase in the price of silver, which grew 5.82 from 29.37 at June 30, 2024 to 31.08 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The 5.67 increase in the NAV from 26.82 at June 30, 2024 to 28.34 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 5.82 increase in the price of silver. 
 
 The NAV increased slightly less than the price of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s fees, which were 16,928,398 for the quarter, or 0.13 of the Trust s average weighted assets of 13,488,289,860 during the quarter. The NAV of 29.63 on September 26, 2024 was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low during the quarter of 24.58 on August 8, 2024. 
 
 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 800,630,649, resulting from an unrealized gain on investment in silver bullion of 544,712,454, a net realized gain of 269,781,344 on silver bullion distributed for the redemption of Shares, a net realized gain of 2,926,466 from investment in silver bullion sold to pay expenses and a net realized gain of 138,783 from litigation proceeds during the quarter, partially offset by a net investment loss of 16,928,398. Other than the Sponsor s fees of 16,928,398, the Trust had no expenses during the quarter. 
 
 The Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 The Trust s net asset value increased from 10,389,177,775 at December 31, 2023 to 14,574,601,678 at September 30, 2024, a 40.29 increase. The increase in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the price of silver, which grew 30.64 from 23.79 at December 31, 2023 to 31.08 at September 30, 2024. The increase in the Trust s net asset value also benefitted from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 477,000,000 Shares at December 31, 2023 to 514,200,000 Shares at September 30, 2024, a consequence of 226,950,000 Shares (4,539 Baskets) being created and 189,750,000 Shares (3,795 Baskets) being redeemed during the period. 
 
 The 30.12 increase in the NAV from 21.78 at December 31, 2023 to 28.34 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 30.64 increase in the price of silver. 
 
 The NAV increased slightly less than the price of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s fees, which were 44,720,517 for the period, or 0.37 of the Trust s average weighted assets of 11,964,851,765 during the period. The NAV of 29.63 on September 26, 2024 was the highest during the period, compared with a low during the period of 20.21 on February 14, 2024. 
 
 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,178,191,885, resulting from an unrealized gain on investment in silver bullion of 2,451,095,160, a net realized gain of 765,560,025 on silver bullion distributed for the redemption of Shares, a net realized gain of 6,118,434 from investment in silver bullion sold to pay expenses and a net realized gain of 138,783 from litigation proceeds during the period, partially offset by a net investment loss of 44,720,517. Other than the Sponsor s fees of 44,720,517, the Trust had no expenses during the period. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 The duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, with the participation of the Trustee, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
