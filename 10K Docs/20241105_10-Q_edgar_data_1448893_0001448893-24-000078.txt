Note 1.) mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market, primarily to two government-sponsored enterprises GSEs ), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held and individual investment securities, respectively, that were in an unrealized loss position. We assess our intent to sell these securities and whether we will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis when determining whether to record an impairment on the securities in an unrealized loss position. In assessing whether the decline in the fair value at September 30, 2024 of any of these securities resulted from a credit loss or other factors, we made inquiries of our investment managers to determine that each issuer was current on its scheduled interest and principal payments. We reviewed the credit rating of these securities noting that approximately of the securities at September 30, 2024 had investment-grade ratings. We concluded that gross unrealized losses noted above were primarily associated with the changes in interest rates subsequent to purchase rather than due to credit impairment. We recorded impairments of million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and impairments of million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to our intent to sell securities in an unrealized loss position. 
 
 The Company's other invested assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled million and million, respectively. Other invested assets are principally comprised of limited partnership interests which are generally accounted for under the equity method or fair value using net asset value (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. Our proportionate share of earnings or losses or changes in fair value are reported in income from other invested assets on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For entities accounted for under the equity method that follow industry-specific guidance for investment companies, our proportionate share of earnings or losses includes changes in the fair value of the underlying assets of these entities. Due to the timing of receiving financial information from these partnerships, the results are generally reported on a one month or quarter lag.

million as of September 30, 2024. The majority of these investments were in limited partnerships invested in real estate or consumer credit. At September 30, 2024, maximum future funding commitments were million. For limited partnership investments that have a contractual expiration date, we expect the liquidation of the underlying assets to occur over the next one to . For certain of these investments, the Company does not have the contractual option to redeem but receives distributions based on the liquidation of the underlying assets. In addition, the Company generally does not have the ability to sell or transfer these investments without the consent from the general partner of individual limited partnerships. 
 
 The fair value of investments deposited with insurance regulatory authorities to meet statutory requirements was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. In connection with its insurance and reinsurance activities, Essent Re is required to maintain assets in trusts for the benefit of its contractual counterparties. The fair value of the investments on deposit in these trusts was billion at September 30, 2024 and billion at December 31, 2023. Essent Guaranty is also required to maintain assets on deposit for the benefit of the sponsor of a fixed income investment commitment. The fair value of the assets on deposit was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023.

 (1) Under QSR-2019, Essent Guaranty cedes of premiums on singles policies and on all other policies. 
 ; however because Essent Guaranty did not exercise its option to terminate the QSR Agreement on December 31, 2021, the maximum profit commission that Essent Guaranty could earn increased to in 2022 through June 30, 2024. Effective July 1, 2024, Essent Guaranty renegotiated the terms extending the termination date for QSR-2019 through December 31, 2027. The renegotiated terms increased the ceding commission from to and decreased the maximum profit commission from to . 
 
 Total RIF ceded under the QSR agreements was billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Excess of Loss Reinsurance 
 
 Essent Guaranty has entered into fully collateralized reinsurance agreements ("Radnor Re Transactions") with unaffiliated special purpose insurers domiciled in Bermuda. For the reinsurance coverage periods, Essent Guaranty and its affiliates retain the first layer of the respective aggregate losses, and a Radnor Re special purpose insurer will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. Essent Guaranty and its affiliates retain losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. The reinsurance premium due to each Radnor Re special purpose insurer is calculated by multiplying the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount at the beginning of a period by a coupon rate, which is the sum of one-month SOFR plus a risk margin, and then subtracting actual investment income collected on the assets in the related reinsurance trust during that period. The aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverage decreases over a period as the underlying covered mortgages amortize. Essent Guaranty has rights to terminate the Radnor Re Transactions. The Radnor Re entities collateralized the coverage by issuing mortgage insurance-linked notes ("ILNs") in an aggregate amount equal to the initial coverage to unaffiliated investors. The notes have legal maturities and are non-recourse to any assets of Essent Guaranty or its affiliates. The proceeds of the notes were deposited into reinsurance trusts for the benefit of Essent Guaranty and will be the source of reinsurance claim payments to Essent Guaranty and principal repayments on the ILNs. 
 
 Essent Guaranty has also entered into reinsurance agreements with panels of reinsurers that provide aggregate excess of loss coverage immediately above or pari-passu to the coverage provided by the Radnor Re Transactions. The aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverage decreases over a period as the underlying covered mortgages amortize. Essent Guaranty has rights to terminate these reinsurance agreements. 
 
 Essent Guaranty has entered into reinsurance agreements with panels of reinsurers that provides excess of loss coverage on new insurance written from January 1, 2018 through August 31, 2019 and from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2024. For the reinsurance coverage periods, Essent Guaranty and its affiliates retain the first layer of the respective aggregate losses, and the reinsurance panels will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amounts. Essent Guaranty and its affiliates retain losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amounts.

The amount of monthly reinsurance premiums ceded to the Radnor Re entities will fluctuate due to changes in one-month SOFR and changes in money market rates that affect investment income collected on the assets in the reinsurance trusts. As the reinsurance premium will vary based on changes in these rates, we concluded that the Radnor Re Transactions contain embedded derivatives that will be accounted for separately like freestanding derivatives. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is reported in earnings and included in other income. 
 
 In connection with the Radnor Re Transactions, we concluded that the risk transfer requirements for reinsurance accounting were met as each Radnor Re entity is assuming significant insurance risk and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss. In addition, we assessed whether each Radnor Re entity was a variable interest entity ("VIE") and the appropriate accounting for the Radnor Re entities if they were VIEs. A VIE is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity s operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. While also considering these factors, the consolidation conclusion depends on the breadth of the decision-making ability and ability to influence activities that significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE. We concluded that the Radnor Re entities are VIEs. However, given that Essent Guaranty (1) does not have the unilateral power to direct the activities that most significantly affect their economic performance and (2) does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to these entities, the Radnor Re entities are not consolidated in these financial statements.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, million was paid for incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years. There has been million of favorable prior year development during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Reserves remaining as of September 30, 2024 for prior years are million as a result of re-estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, million was paid for incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years. There was million of favorable prior year development during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Reserves remaining as of September 30, 2023 for prior years were million as a result of re-estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. In both periods, the favorable prior years' loss development was the result of a re-estimation of amounts ultimately to be paid on prior year defaults in the default inventory, including the impact of previously identified defaults that cured. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims. 
 
 The Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds rate several times during 2022 and 2023 in an effort to reduce consumer price inflation. As a result of progress on inflation, in September 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points. Mortgage interest rates remain elevated which may lower home sale activity and affect the options available to delinquent borrowers. It is reasonably possible that our estimate of losses could change in the near term as a result

of our total insurance in force. It is too early to tell how many claims we ultimately may have to pay associated with any defaults in the hurricane impacted areas. There are many factors contributing to the uncertainty surrounding these insured loans. Under our master policy, loan servicers are not required to notify us of a default until the borrower has missed two consecutive minimum payments. Also, the level of damage being reported in these areas varies significantly from region to region. Further, under our master policy, our exposure may be limited on hurricane-related claims. For example, we are permitted to exclude a claim entirely where damage to the property underlying a mortgage was the proximate cause of the default and adjust a claim where the property underlying a mortgage in default is subject to unrestored physical damage. These events have not materially affected our reserves as of September 30, 2024.

 secured credit facility with a committed capacity of million (the "Existing Credit Facility"). The Existing Credit Facility also provided for up to million aggregate principal amount of uncommitted incremental term loan and/or revolving credit facilities that may be exercised at the Borrowers option so long as the Borrowers receive commitments from the lenders. Borrowings under the Existing Credit Facility may have been used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, capital contributions to Essent s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Borrowings accrued interest at a floating rate tied to a standard short-term borrowing index, selected at the Company s option, plus an applicable margin. A commitment fee was due quarterly on the average daily amount of the undrawn revolving commitment. The applicable margin and the commitment fee were based on the senior unsecured debt rating or long-term issuer rating of Essent Group to the extent available, or the insurer financial strength rating of Essent Guaranty. The obligations under the Existing Credit Facility were secured by certain assets of the Borrowers, excluding the stock and assets of its insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. The Credit Facility contained several covenants, including financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, capital and liquidity levels, maximum debt to capitalization level and Essent Guaranty's compliance with the PMIERs (see Note 14). As of June 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants and million had been borrowed under the term loan portion of the Existing Credit Facility with a weighted average interest rate of . As of December 31, 2023, million had been borrowed with a weighted average interest rate of . 
 
 On July 1, 2024, Essent Group completed an underwritten public offering of million principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 (the Senior Notes"). Interest on the Senior Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2025. The Senior Notes will mature on July 1, 2029. At any time prior to June 1, 2029 (one month prior to the maturity date), the Company may redeem the Senior Notes, at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price described in the Supplemental Indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time and from time to time on or after June 1, 2029, the Company may redeem, at its option, in whole or in part, the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, were approximately million. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes to repay all of the borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the Existing Credit Facility described above, and intends to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
 
 On July 1, 2024, concurrently with the closing of the Offering of the Senior Notes and the repayment of all of the borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of its Existing Credit Agreement, the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement became effective and amends and restates the Existing Credit Facility.

 million in remedy payments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we made remedy payments in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, management believes any potential claims for indemnification related to contract underwriting services through September 30, 2024 are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 
 In addition to the indemnifications discussed above, in the normal course of business, we enter into agreements or other relationships with third parties pursuant to which we may be obligated under specified circumstances to indemnify the counterparties with respect to certain matters. Our contractual indemnification obligations typically arise in the context of agreements entered into by us to, among other things, purchase or sell services, finance our business and business transactions, lease real property and license intellectual property. The agreements we enter into in the normal course of business generally require us to pay certain amounts to the other party associated with claims or losses if they result from our breach of the agreement, including the inaccuracy of representations or warranties. The agreements we enter into may also contain other indemnification provisions that obligate us to pay amounts upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the negligence or willful misconduct of our employees, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or claims that performance of the agreement constitutes a violation of law. Generally, payment by us under an indemnification provision is conditioned upon the other party making a claim, and typically we can challenge the other party s claims. Further, our indemnification obligations may be limited in time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us under an indemnification agreement or obligation. As of September 30, 2024, contingencies triggering material indemnification obligations or payments have not occurred historically and are not expected to occur. The nature of the indemnification provisions in the various types of agreements and relationships described above are believed to be low risk and pervasive, and we consider them to have a remote risk of loss or payment. We have not recorded any provisions on the condensed consolidated balance sheets related to indemnifications.

The common shares have no preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for additional shares, and no rights of redemption, conversion or exchange. Under certain circumstances and subject to the provisions of Bermuda law and our bye-laws, we may be required to make an offer to repurchase shares held by members. The common shares rank pari passu with one another in all respects as to rights of payment and distribution. In general, holders of common shares will have vote for each common share held by them and will be entitled to vote, on a non-cumulative basis, at all meetings of shareholders. In the event that a shareholder is considered a Shareholder under our bye-laws, such shareholder's votes will be reduced by whatever amount is necessary so that after any such reduction the votes of such shareholder will not result in any other person being treated as a shareholder with respect to the vote on such matter.

In February and July 2024, certain members of senior management were granted nonvested common shares under the 2013 Plan that are subject to time-based and performance-based vesting. The time-based share awards granted in February and July 2024 vest annually in three equal installments commencing on March 1 of the year following the grant year. The performance-based share awards granted in February and July 2024 vest based upon our compounded annual book value per share growth percentage and relative total shareholder return during a performance period that commenced on January 1, 2024, and they vest on March 1, 2027. Shares were issued at the maximum of target. 

In the event that the compounded annual book value per share growth or the relative total shareholder return falls between the performance levels shown above, the nonvested common shares earned will be determined on a straight-line basis between the respective levels shown. 
 
 In February 2024, nonvested common share units were issued to certain vice president and staff level employees and are subject to time-based vesting in two equal installments on January 6, 2025 and 2026. Also in February 2024, time-based share units were granted to certain vice president and staff level employees that vest in three equal installments on March 1, 2027, 2028 and 2029. In connection with our incentive program covering bonus awards for performance year 2023, in February 2024, time-based share units were issued to certain employees that vest in three equal installments on March 1, 2025, 2026 and 2027. 
 
 Quoted market prices are used for the valuation of common shares granted that do not contain a market condition under ASC 718. The performance-based share awards granted in February 2022, 2023 and 2024 contain a market condition and were valued based on analysis provided by a third-party valuation firm using a risk-neutral simulation taking into effect the vesting conditions of the grant. 
 
 The total fair value on the vesting date of nonvested shares, share units or DEUs that vested was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was

 Net income determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices differs from GAAP. In 2024 and 2023, the more significant differences between net income determined under statutory accounting practices and GAAP for Essent Guaranty and Essent PA relate to policy acquisition costs and income taxes. Under statutory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred while such costs are capitalized and amortized to expense over the life of the policy under GAAP. We are eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations for amounts required by state law or regulation to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves when we purchase non-interest-bearing United States Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds T L Bonds issued by the Treasury Department. Under statutory accounting practices, this deduction reduces the tax provision recorded by Essent Guaranty and Essent PA and, as a result, increases statutory net income and surplus as compared to net income and equity determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the statutory capital of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which is defined as the total of statutory surplus and contingency reserves, was in excess of the statutory capital necessary to satisfy their regulatory requirements. 
 
 Effective December 31, 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at the direction of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, implemented new coordinated Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements, which we refer to as the "PMIERs." The PMIERs represent the standards by which private mortgage insurers are eligible to provide mortgage insurance on loans owned

 Under The Insurance Act 1978, as amended, and related regulations of Bermuda (the "Insurance Act"), Essent Re is required to annually prepare statutory financial statements and a statutory financial return in accordance with the financial reporting provisions of the Insurance Act, which is a basis other than GAAP. The Insurance Act also requires that Essent Re maintain minimum share capital of 1 million and must ensure that the value of its general business assets exceeds the amount of its general business liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margins and enhanced capital requirement pertaining to its general business. At December 31, 2023, all such requirements were met.

Earnings 

We did not have any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. These pro forma amounts have been calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting the results of Agents National Title and Boston National Title to reflect the additional amortization that would have been charged to earnings assuming the fair value adjustments for the intangible assets acquired had been applied from January 1, 2023, including consequential income tax effects.

These expenses are included in other underwriting and operating expenses on our condensed consolidated income statement and are reflected in pro forma earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 in the table above. 
 
 The acquisition of Agents National Title and Boston National Title was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration transferred were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company allocated the goodwill to its Title operating segment.

 Essent Guaranty, Inc., our wholly-owned mortgage insurance subsidiary which we refer to as "Essent Guaranty," is approved by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and licensed to write coverage in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our mortgage insurance operations generated new insurance written, or NIW, of approximately 12.5 billion and 33.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to approximately 12.5 billion and 38.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The financial strength ratings of Essent Guaranty are A3 with a positive outlook by Moody s Investors Service Moody's ), A- with a stable outlook by S P Global Ratings S P and A (Excellent) with a stable outlook by A.M. Best Ratings Services, Inc. ("AM Best"). 
 
 We also offer mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance through our wholly-owned Bermuda-based subsidiary, Essent Reinsurance Ltd., which we refer to as "Essent Re." As of September 30, 2024, Essent Re provided insurance or reinsurance relating to GSE risk share and other reinsurance transactions covering approximately 2.3 billion of risk. Essent Re also reinsures Essent Guaranty s NIW under a quota share reinsurance agreement. In April 2021, Essent Guaranty and Essent Re agreed to increase the quota share reinsurance coverage of Essent Guaranty s NIW provided by Essent Re from 25 to 35 effective January 1, 2021. The quota share reinsurance coverage provided by Essent Re for Essent Guaranty s NIW prior to January 1, 2021 will continue to be 25 , the quota share percentage in effect at the time NIW was first ceded.

 Current Developments 
 
 The Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds rate several times during 2022 and 2023 in an effort to reduce consumer price inflation. As a result of progress on inflation, in September 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points. Mortgage interest rates remain elevated which has reduced home buying and mortgage refinance activity resulting in lower volumes of mortgage originations, new insurance written and title insurance and settlement service transactions. These rate actions have also resulted in increases in our net investment income generated by our investment portfolio and the persistency of our mortgage insurance in force.

 On September 26, 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall and caused property damage in certain counties in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. On October 9, 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall causing damage in certain counties in Florida. We believe these hurricanes could have an impact on our insured portfolio s performance and expect to experience increased defaults in these areas beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. As of October 31, 2024, our insurance in force in counties with Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") disaster declarations due to hurricanes Helene and Milton is approximately of our total insurance in force. It is too early to tell how many claims we ultimately may have to pay associated with any defaults in the hurricane impacted areas. There are many factors contributing to the uncertainty surrounding these insured loans. Under our master policy, loan servicers are not required to notify us of a default until the borrower has missed two consecutive minimum payments. Also, the level of damage being reported in these areas varies significantly from region to region. Further, under our master policy, our exposure may be limited on hurricane-related claims. For example, we are permitted to exclude a claim entirely where damage to the property underlying a mortgage was the proximate cause of the default and adjust a claim where the property underlying a mortgage in default is subject to unrestored physical damage. These events have not materially affected our reserves as of September 30, 2024.

 Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 
 Our results are significantly impacted by, and our future success may be affected by, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the housing finance industry. See Part I, Item 1 Business Regulation and Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Legislative and Regulatory Developments in our Annual Report for a discussion of the laws and regulations to which we are subject as well as legislative and regulatory developments affecting the housing finance industry. 
 
 U.S. Tax Reform 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA ), was enacted, which, among other things, provides for a corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. Based on our current analysis of the provisions, we do not expect the IRA to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. As the IRS issues additional guidance related to the IRA, we will evaluate any potential impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Bermuda Corporate Income Tax 
 
 On December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 ("CIT"). Starting January 1, 2025, the CIT will result in a new 15 corporate income tax on in-scope entities that are resident in Bermuda or that have a Bermuda permanent establishment, without regard to any assurances that had previously been given pursuant to the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966. 
 
 The CIT also includes various transitional provisions and elections that we are in the process of evaluating. In particular, we believe that, based on their current structure and operations, our Bermuda companies will be eligible to elect a five-year limited international presence exemption under the CIT. We intend to make this election within the timeframe required under Bermuda law, and therefore do not expect the CIT to have a material impact upon our effective tax rate until we no longer meet the exemption criteria, or January 1, 2030, the fifth anniversary of the inception date of the tax, whichever may occur sooner. The exemption criteria are subject to interpretation of existing Bermuda law, as well as any related new regulations that may be issued by the Government of Bermuda. No assurances can be made that we will continue meeting such criteria for the entire five-year period. 

Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 
 Net Premiums Written and Earned 
 
 Premiums associated with our U.S. mortgage insurance business are based on mortgage insurance in force, or IIF, during all or a portion of a period. A change in the average IIF during a period causes premiums to increase or decrease as compared to prior periods. Average net premium rates in effect during a given period will also cause premiums to differ when compared to earlier periods. IIF at the end of a reporting period is a function of the IIF at the beginning of such reporting period plus NIW less policy cancellations (including claims paid) during the period. As a result, premiums are generally influenced by: 
 
 NIW, which is the aggregate principal amount of the new mortgages that are insured during a period. Many factors affect NIW, including, among others, the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations, the competition 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages, the number of customers who have approved us to provide mortgage insurance and changes in our NIW from certain customers; 
 
 Cancellations of our insurance policies, which are impacted by payments on mortgages, home price appreciation, or refinancings, which in turn are affected by mortgage interest rates. Cancellations are also impacted by the levels of claim payments and rescissions; 
 
 Premium rates, which represent the amount of the premium due as a percentage of IIF. Premium rates are based on the risk characteristics of the loans insured, the percentage of coverage on the loans, competition from other mortgage insurers and general industry conditions; and 
 
 Premiums ceded or assumed under reinsurance arrangements. See Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Mortgage insurance premiums are paid either on a monthly installment basis monthly premiums ), in a single payment at origination single premiums ), or in some cases as an annual premium. For monthly premiums, we receive a monthly premium payment which is recorded as net premiums earned in the month the coverage is provided. Monthly premium payments are based on the original mortgage amount rather than the amortized loan balance. Net premiums written may be in excess of net premiums earned due to single premium policies. For single premiums, we receive a single premium payment at origination, which is recorded as unearned premium and earned over the estimated life of the policy, which ranges from 36 to 156 months depending on the term of the underlying mortgage and loan-to-value ratio at date of origination. If single premium policies are cancelled due to repayment of the underlying loan and the premium is non-refundable, the remaining unearned premium balance is immediately recognized as earned premium revenue. Substantially all of our single premium policies in force as of September 30, 2024 were non-refundable. Premiums collected on annual policies are recognized as net premiums earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, monthly premium policies comprised 98 and 96 of our NIW, respectively. 
 
 Premiums associated with our GSE and other risk share transactions are based on the level of risk in force and premium rates on the transactions. 
 
 Title insurance premiums are based on the number of title insurance policies issued and generally recognized as income at the transaction closing date which approximates the policy effective date. 
 
 Persistency and Business Mix 
 
 The percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any 12-month period is defined as our persistency rate. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, higher persistency rates can have a significant impact on our profitability. The persistency rate on our portfolio was 86.6 at September 30, 2024. Generally, higher prepayment speeds lead to lower persistency. 
 
 Prepayment speeds and the relative mix of business between single premium policies and monthly premium policies also impact our profitability. Our premium rates include certain assumptions regarding repayment or prepayment speeds of the mortgages. Because premiums are paid at origination on single premium policies, assuming all other factors remain constant, if loans are prepaid earlier than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to increase and, if loans are repaid slower than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to decrease. By contrast, if monthly premium loans are repaid earlier than anticipated, our premium earned with respect to those loans and therefore our profitability declines. Currently, the expected return on single premium policies is less than the expected return on monthly policies. 
 
 Net Investment Income 
 
 Our investment portfolio was predominantly comprised of investment-grade fixed income securities and money market funds as of September 30, 2024. The principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the investment portfolio and the yield on individual securities. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair market value, such as from changes in interest rates), the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of increases in capital and cash generated from or used in operations which is impacted by net premiums received, investment earnings, net claim payments and expenses. Realized gains and losses are a function of the difference between the amount received on the sale of a security and the security s amortized cost, as well as any provision for credit losses or impairments recognized in earnings. The amount received on the sale of fixed income securities is affected by the coupon rate of the security compared to the yield of comparable securities at the time of sale.

Table of Contents 

Income from Other Invested Assets 
 
 As part of our overall investment strategy, we also allocate a relatively small percentage of our portfolio to limited partnership investments in real estate, consumer credit and traditional venture capital and private equity investments. The results of these investing activities are reported in income from other invested assets. These investments are generally accounted for under the equity method or fair value using net asset value (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. For entities accounted for under the equity method that follow industry-specific guidance for investment companies, our proportionate share of earnings or losses includes changes in the fair value of the underlying assets of these entities. Fluctuations in the fair value of these entities may increase the volatility of the Company s reported results of operations. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Other income includes revenues associated with underwriting consulting services to third-party reinsurers, title settlement services and contract underwriting services. The level of these revenues are dependent upon the number of customers who have engaged us for these services. Revenue from underwriting consulting services to third-party reinsurers is also dependent upon the level of premiums associated with the transactions underwritten for these customers. Revenue from title settlement services and contract underwriting revenue are also dependent upon the number of loans underwritten for these customers. 
 
 In connection with the acquisition of our mortgage insurance platform, we entered into a services agreement with Triad Guaranty Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Triad Guaranty Insurance Corporation, which we refer to collectively as Triad, to provide certain information technology maintenance and development and customer support-related services. In return for these services, we receive a flat monthly fee which is recorded in other income. During 2023, Triad entered into a three year renewal and extended the services agreement through November 2026. 
 
 As more fully described in Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, the premiums ceded under certain reinsurance contracts with unaffiliated third parties varies based on changes in market interest rates. Under GAAP, these contracts contain embedded derivatives that are accounted for separately as freestanding derivatives. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is reported in earnings and included in other income. 
 
 Provision for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 
 The provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects the current expense that is recorded within a particular period to reflect actual and estimated loss payments that we believe will ultimately be made as a result of insured loans that are in default. 
 
 Losses incurred are generally affected by: 
 
 the overall state of the economy, which broadly affects the likelihood that borrowers may default on their loans and have the ability to cure such defaults; 
 
 changes in housing values, which affect our ability to mitigate our losses through the sale of properties with loans in default as well as borrower willingness to continue to make mortgage payments when the value of the home is below or perceived to be below the mortgage balance; 
 
 the product mix of IIF, with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher defaults and claims; 
 
 the size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase losses incurred; 
 
 the loan-to-value ratio, with higher average loan-to-value ratios tending to increase losses incurred; 
 
 the percentage of coverage on insured loans, with deeper average coverage tending to increase losses incurred; 
 
 credit quality of borrowers, including higher debt-to-income ratios and lower FICO scores, which tend to increase incurred losses; 
 
 the level and amount of reinsurance coverage maintained with third parties; 
 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 the rate at which we rescind policies. Because of tighter underwriting standards generally in the mortgage lending industry and terms set forth in our master policy, we expect that our level of rescission activity will be lower than rescission activity seen in the mortgage insurance industry for vintages originated prior to the financial crisis; and 
 
 the distribution of claims over the life of a book. As of September 30, 2024, 53 of our IIF relates to business written since January 1, 2022 and was less than three years old. As a result, based on historical industry performance, we expect the number of defaults and claims we experience, as well as our provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses ("LAE"), to increase as our portfolio seasons. See Mortgage Insurance Earnings and Cash Flow Cycle below. 
 
 We establish loss reserves for delinquent loans when we are notified that a borrower has missed at least two consecutive monthly payments Case Reserves ), as well as estimated reserves for defaults that may have occurred but not yet been reported to us IBNR Reserves ). We also establish reserves for the associated loss adjustment expenses, consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process, including legal and other fees. Using both internal and external information, we establish our reserves based on the likelihood that a default will reach claim status and estimated claim severity. See Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies included in our Annual Report for further information. 
 
 Based upon our experience and industry data, claims incidence for mortgage insurance is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination. As of September 30, 2024, 53 of our IIF relates to business written since January 1, 2022 and was less than three years old. Although the claims experience on new insurance written by us to date has been favorable, we expect incurred losses and claims to increase as a greater amount of this book of insurance reaches its anticipated period of highest claim frequency. The actual default rate and the average reserve per default that we experience as our portfolio matures is difficult to predict and is dependent on the specific characteristics of our current in-force book (including the credit score of the borrower, the loan-to-value ratio of the mortgage, geographic concentrations, etc.), as well as the profile of new business we write in the future. In addition, the default rate and the average reserve per default will be affected by future macroeconomic factors such as housing prices, interest rates and employment. 
 
 The economy in the United States has experienced elevated levels of consumer price inflation and the Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds rate several times during 2022 and 2023 in an effort to reduce consumer price inflation. As a result of progress on inflation, in September 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points. Mortgage interest rates remain elevated which may lower home sale activity and affect the options available to delinquent borrowers. It is reasonably possible that our estimate of losses could change in the near term as a result of changes in the economic environment, the impact of elevated levels of consumer price inflation on home sale activity, housing inventory, and home prices. 
 
 As more fully described in Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, at September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.7 billion of excess of loss reinsurance covering NIW from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019 and August 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024 and quota share reinsurance on portions of our NIW effective September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. The impact on our reserves in future periods will be dependent upon the amount of delinquent notices received from loan servicers, the performance of defaults and our expectations for the amount of ultimate losses on these delinquencies. 
 
 Third-Party Reinsurance 
 
 We use third-party reinsurance to provide protection against adverse loss experience and to expand our capital sources. When we enter into a reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium and, in exchange, agrees to insure an agreed upon portion of incurred losses. These arrangements have the impact of reducing our earned premiums, but also reduce our risk in force ("RIF"), which provides capital relief, and may include capital relief under the PMIERs financial strength requirements. Our incurred losses are reduced by any incurred losses ceded in accordance with the reinsurance agreement. For additional information regarding reinsurance, see Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Other Underwriting and Operating Expenses 
 
 Our other underwriting and operating expenses include components that are substantially fixed, as well as expenses that generally increase or decrease in line with the level of NIW. 
 
 Our most significant expense is compensation and benefits for our employees, which represented 59 and 60 of other underwriting and operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 57 and 57 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 of other underwriting and operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Compensation and benefits expense includes base and incentive cash compensation, stock compensation expense, benefits and payroll taxes. 
 
 Underwriting and other expenses include legal, consulting, other professional fees, premium taxes, travel, entertainment, marketing, licensing, supplies, hardware, software, rent, utilities, depreciation and amortization and other expenses. We anticipate that as we continue to add new customers and increase our mortgage insurance IIF, title insurance policies issued and settlement services provided, our expenses will also continue to increase. 
 
 Premiums Retained by Agents 
 
 Premiums retained by agents represent the portion of title insurance premiums retained by our third-party agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts. These amounts are recorded as an expense and reported separately on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consistent with industry practice. The percentage of premiums retained by agents vary according to regional differences in real estate closing practices and state regulations. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Through June 30, 2024, interest expense was incurred as a result of borrowings under our secured credit facility (the Existing Credit Facility ). Borrowings accrued interest at a floating rate tied to a standard short-term borrowing index, selected at the Company s option, plus an applicable margin. On July 1, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of 500 million of 6.25 Senior Notes due in 2029 and used approximately 425 million of the net proceeds to repay all of the borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the Existing Credit Facility. Concurrently, on July 1, 2024, the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement became effective providing for an effective increase in the Company s revolving credit facility borrowing capacity from 400 million to 500 million. See Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes are incurred based on the amount of earnings or losses generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the applicable tax rates and regulations in those jurisdictions. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are generally not subject to income taxes in most states in which we operate; however, our non-insurance subsidiaries are subject to state income taxes. In lieu of state income taxes, our insurance subsidiaries pay premium taxes that are recorded in other underwriting and operating expenses. 
 
 Essent Group Ltd. ("Essent Group") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Essent Re, are domiciled in Bermuda, and their income is currently not subject to a corporate income tax. See " Legislative and Regulatory Developments Bermuda Corporate Income Tax" above. Under a quota share reinsurance agreement, Essent Re reinsures 25 of Essent Guaranty s NIW through December 31, 2020 and 35 of Essent Guaranty s NIW after December 31, 2020. Essent Re also provides insurance and reinsurance to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. 
 
 The amount of income tax expense or benefit recorded in future periods will be dependent on the jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax laws and regulations in effect. 
 
 Mortgage Insurance Earnings and Cash Flow Cycle 
 
 In general, the majority of any underwriting profit (premium revenue minus losses) that a book generates occurs in the early years of the book, with the largest portion of any underwriting profit realized in the first year. Subsequent years of a book generally result in modest underwriting profit or underwriting losses. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years of the book, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses.

 Key Performance Indicators 
 
 Insurance In Force 
 
 As discussed above, mortgage insurance premiums we collect and earn are generated based on our IIF, which is a function of our NIW and cancellations. The following table includes a summary of the change in our IIF for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for our U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio. In addition, this table includes our RIF at the end of each period.

 Average Net Premium Rate 
 
 Our average net premium rate is calculated by dividing net premiums earned for the U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio by average insurance in force for the period and is dependent on a number of factors, including: (1) the risk characteristics and average coverage on the mortgages we insure; (2) the mix of monthly premiums compared to single premiums in our portfolio; (3) cancellations of non-refundable single premiums during the period; (4) changes to our pricing for NIW; and (5) premiums ceded under third-party reinsurance agreements. The following table presents the average net premium rate for our U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Base average premium rate 
 0.41 0.40 0.41 0.40 Single premium cancellations Gross average premium rate 0.41 0.40 0.41 0.40 Ceded premiums (0.06) (0.05) (0.05) (0.06) Net average premium rate 0.35 0.35 0.36 0.34 
 
 The continued use of third-party reinsurance along with changes to the level of future cancellations of non-refundable single premium policies and mix of IIF may impact our average net premium rate in future periods.

Table of Contents 

 Persistency Rate 
 
 The measure for assessing the impact of policy cancellations on IIF is our persistency rate, defined as the percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any twelve-month period. See additional discussion regarding the impact of the persistency rate on our performance in Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Persistency and Business Mix. 
 
 Risk-to-Capital 
 
 The risk-to-capital ratio has historically been used as a measure of capital adequacy in the U.S. mortgage insurance industry and is calculated as a ratio of net risk in force to statutory capital. Net risk in force represents total risk in force net of reinsurance ceded and net of exposures on policies for which loss reserves have been established. Statutory capital for our U.S. insurance companies is computed based on accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. See additional discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources Insurance Company Capital. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our combined net risk in force for our U.S. mortgage insurance companies was 34.9 billion and our combined statutory capital was 3.6 billion, resulting in a risk-to-capital ratio of 9.7:1. The amount of capital required varies in each jurisdiction in which we operate; however, generally, the maximum permitted risk-to-capital ratio is 25.0 to 1. State insurance regulators are currently examining their respective capital rules to determine whether, in light of the financial crisis, changes are needed to more accurately assess mortgage insurers ability to withstand stressful economic conditions. As a result, the capital metrics under which they assess and measure capital adequacy may change in the future. Independent of the state regulator and GSE capital requirements, management continually assesses the risk of our insurance portfolio and current market and economic conditions to determine the appropriate levels of capital to support our business. 

Results of Operations 
 
 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods indicated:

 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income of 176.2 million, compared to net income of 178.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income of 561.5 million, compared to net income of 521.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 decrease in our operating results during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to increases in the provision for losses and operating expenses, largely offset by increases in net premiums earned and net investment income, The increase in our operating results during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to increases in net premiums earned and net investment income, partially offset by increases in the provision for losses and operating expenses. 
 
 Net Premiums Written and Earned 
 
 Net premiums written and earned increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net premium written and earned increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 11 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net premiums written and earned in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include 17.7 million and 49.6 million of net premiums written and earned by our title insurance operations, compared to 20.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net premiums written and earned was also due to the increase in our average IIF from 237.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 242.1 billion for the three months ended and September 30, 2024, and from 233.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 240.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average net premium rate was 0.35 and 0.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average net premium rate was 0.36 and 0.34 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the average net premium rate in the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was a result of a decrease in ceded premium, changes in the mix of mortgages we insure, higher persistency and changes in our pricing. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, ceded premiums decreased to 92.5 million from 103.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease in outstanding excess of loss reinsurance in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 than the comparable period of the prior year, as a result of the retiring of outstanding notes for two of our seasoned ILN transactions in 2023. 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, unearned premiums decreased by 6.0 million and 6.2 million, respectively. The change in unearned premiums was a result of net premiums written on single premium policies of 2.4 million and 4.7 million, respectively, which was offset by 8.4 million and 10.9 million, respectively, of unearned premium that was recognized in earnings during the periods. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, unearned premiums decreased by 19.3 million and 15.2 million, respectively. This was a result of net premiums written on single premium policies of 6.9 million and 18.9 million, respectively, which was offset by 26.2 million and 34.1 million, respectively, of unearned premium that was recognized in earnings during the periods. 

Net Investment Income 
 
 Our net investment income was derived from the following sources for the periods indicated: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Fixed maturities 44,828 45,373 136,485 132,623 Short-term investments 13,786 3,641 32,759 8,660 Gross investment income 58,614 49,014 169,244 141,283 Investment expenses (1,274) (1,942) (3,733) (5,725) Net investment income 57,340 47,072 165,511 135,558 
 
 The increases in net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 was due to an increase in the pre-tax investment income yield as well as an increase in the weighted average balance of our investment portfolio. The pre-tax investment income yield increased from 3.6 and 3.5 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.8 in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to a general increase in investment yields due to rising interest rates. The average cash and investment portfolio balance increased to 6.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average cash and investment portfolio balance increased to 6.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average cash and investment portfolio was primarily due to investing cash flows from operations, See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details of our investment portfolio.

Income (Loss) from Other Invested Assets 
 
 Income (loss) from other invested assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was income of 2.8 million as compared to a loss of 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income (loss) from other invested assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was income of 0.5 million as compared to a loss of 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.The increase in income from other invested assets was primarily due to favorable fair value adjustments recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.4 million as compared to 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to increases in settlement services revenue and Triad service fee income. Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.7 million compared to 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to unfavorable derivative fair value adjustments and a decrease in underwriting consulting services to third party reinsurers, partially offset by increases in settlement services revenue and Triad service fee income. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recorded a net unfavorable decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of 2.3 million compared to a net favorable increase of 1.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Provision for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 we recorded a provision for losses of 30.7 million compared to a provision of 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recorded a provision for losses of 40.2 million compared to a provision of 11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in the provision for losses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable periods of the prior year was primarily due to increases in new defaults reported, resulting in increases in the provision for losses recorded for current year defaults, partially offset by cure activity for defaults reported in prior years.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for losses and LAE was a provision of 30.7 million, comprised of 53.6 million of current year losses partially offset by 22.9 million of favorable prior years loss development. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the provision for losses and LAE was 10.8 million, comprised of 37.5 million of current year losses partially offset by 26.7 million of favorable prior years loss development. In both periods, the prior years loss development was the result of a re-estimation of amounts ultimately to be paid on prior year defaults in the default inventory, including the impact of previously identified defaults that cured. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for losses and LAE was 40.2 million, comprised of 124.2 million of current year losses partially offset by 83.9 million of favorable prior years loss development.

 Other Underwriting and Operating Expenses 
 
 Following are the components of our other underwriting and operating expenses for the periods indicated:

 552 528 539 418 
 
 The significant factors contributing to the change in other underwriting and operating expenses are: 
 
 Compensation and benefits increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the average number of employees during the periods, as well as increased stock-based compensation expense. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, wages and bonus, stock-based compensation expense, benefits and payroll taxes. 
 
 Premium taxes increased primarily due to an increase in premiums written, including title insurance premiums written net of premiums retained by agents, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other expenses decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of decreases in professional fees and an increase in ceding commission earned under the QSR Agreements. Other expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of a full year-to-date period of title insurance and settlement services expenses as well as increases in software and occupancy related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees and an increase in ceding commission earned under the QSR Agreements. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, other expenses included approximately 0.2 million and 4.4 million, respectively, of transaction costs associated with the Company's title business acquisition. Other expenses include professional fees, travel, marketing, hardware, software, rent, depreciation and amortization and other facilities expenses. 
 
 Premiums Retained by Agents 
 
 Premiums retained by agents for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 9.6 million, compared to 13.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in premiums retained by agents for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily the result of decreased utilization of third party agents for insurance premiums written during the third quarter of 2024. The increase in premiums retained by agents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is due to the timing of the acquisition of the title operations which was effective July 1, 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred interest expense of 11.5 million and 27.2 million, respectively, as compared to 7.9 million and 22.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. On July 1, 2024, Essent Group completed an underwritten public offering of 500 million principal amount of

 6.25 Senior Notes due 2029 (the Senior Notes"). The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes to repay all of the borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the Existing Credit Facility on July 1, 2024. Interest expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a loss on debt extinguishment of 3.2 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs on the borrowings repaid in July. The increases in interest expense were also due to an increase in the average borrowings outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same periods in 2023. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the average amount of borrowings outstanding were 500 million and 450 million, respectively, compared to 425 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 6.32 and 6.84 , respectively, as compared to 7.14 and 6.71 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our subsidiaries in the United States file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return. Our income tax expense was 31.4 million and 31.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 99.0 million and 99.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was calculated using an estimated annual effective tax rate of 15.1 as compared to an estimated annual effective tax rate of 15.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense includes 0.6 million of discrete tax benefit associated with realized and unrealized losses recognized during the period as well as excess tax benefits associated with the vesting of common shares and common share units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense includes 2.0 million of discrete tax benefit associated with realized and unrealized losses recognized during the period partially offset by excess tax deficits associated with the vesting of common shares and common share units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense also includes 5.3 million of net expense associated with prior year tax returns. The tax effects of discrete items are recognized in the reporting period in which they occur and are not considered in determining the annual effective tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our sources of funds consist primarily of: 
 
 our investment portfolio and interest income on the portfolio; 
 
 net premiums that we will receive from our existing IIF as well as policies that we write in the future; 
 
 borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; and 
 
 issuance of capital shares. 
 
 Our obligations consist primarily of: 
 
 claim payments under our policies; 
 
 interest payments and repayment of borrowings under our Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility; 
 
 the other costs and operating expenses of our business; 
 
 the repurchase of common shares under the share repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors; and

On July 1, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of 500 million of 6.25 Senior Notes due in 2029. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes to repay the 425 million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the Existing Credit Facility and intends to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. On July 1, 2024, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Senior Notes and the repayment of all of the borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the Existing Credit Facility, the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement became effective and amends and restates the Existing Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for an effective increase in the Company s revolving credit facility borrowing capacity from 400 million to 500 million. 
 
 Management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity available both at its holding companies and in its insurance and other operating subsidiaries to meet its operating cash needs and obligations and committed capital expenditures for the next 12 months. 
 
 While the Company and all of its subsidiaries are expected to have sufficient liquidity to meet all their expected obligations, additional capital may be required to meet any new capital requirements that are adopted by regulatory authorities or the GSEs, to respond to changes in the business or economic environment, to provide additional capital related to the growth of our risk in force in our mortgage insurance portfolio, or to fund new business initiatives. We regularly review potential investments and acquisitions, some of which may be material, that, if consummated, would expand our existing business or result in new lines of business, and at any given time we may be in discussions concerning possible transactions. We continually evaluate opportunities based upon market conditions to further increase our financial flexibility through the issuance of equity or debt, or other options including reinsurance or credit risk transfer transactions. There can be no guarantee that any such opportunities will be available on acceptable terms or at all. 
 
 At the operating subsidiary level, liquidity could be impacted by any one of the following factors: 
 
 significant decline in the value of our investments; 
 
 inability to sell investment assets to provide cash to fund operating needs; 
 
 decline in expected revenues generated from operations; 
 
 increase in expected claim payments related to our IIF; or 
 
 increase in operating expenses. 
 
 Our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain capital and dividend rules and regulations prescribed by jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate and the GSEs. Under the insurance laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends during any twelve-month period in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 10 of the preceding year-end statutory policyholders' surplus or (ii) the preceding year s statutory net income. The Pennsylvania statute also requires that dividends and other distributions be paid out of positive unassigned surplus without prior approval. At September 30, 2024, Essent Guaranty had unassigned surplus of approximately 362.8 million and Essent PA had unassigned surplus of approximately 22.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, Essent Guaranty and Essent PA could pay additional ordinary dividends in 2024 of 261.8 million and 5.4 million, respectively. 
 
 Essent Re is subject to certain dividend restrictions as prescribed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority and under certain agreements with counterparties. In connection with a quota share reinsurance agreement with Essent Guaranty, Essent Re has agreed to maintain a minimum total equity of 100 million. As of September 30, 2024, Essent Re had total equity of 1.8 billion. In connection with its insurance and reinsurance activities, Essent Re is required to maintain assets in trusts for the benefit of its contractual counterparties. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2024, our insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with these rules, regulations and agreements.

 (32,481) 15,539 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled 634.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 547.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in net premiums written and investment income partially offset by an increase in operating expenses paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash flow used in investing activities totaled 599.0 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 396.3 million used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In both periods, cash flow used in investing activities relates primarily to investing cash flows from operations. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash flow used in financing activities totaled 68.3 million and 135.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to the quarterly cash dividends paid, repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase plans and treasury stock acquired from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows from financing activities also included cash inflow from the issuance of Senior Notes, partially offset by cash outflows associated with the repayment of the term loan portion of the Existing Credit Facility, as well as the payment of debt issuance costs. 
 
 Insurance Company Capital 
 
 We compute a risk-to-capital ratio for our U.S. mortgage insurance companies on a separate company statutory basis, as well as for our combined mortgage insurance operations. The risk-to-capital ratio is our net risk in force divided by our statutory capital. Our net risk in force represents risk in force net of reinsurance ceded, if any, and net of exposures on policies for which loss reserves have been established. Statutory capital consists primarily of statutory policyholders surplus (which increases as a result of statutory net income and decreases as a result of statutory net loss and dividends paid), plus the statutory contingency reserve. The statutory contingency reserve is reported as a liability on the statutory balance sheet. A mortgage insurance company is required to make annual contributions to the contingency reserve of 50 of net premiums earned. These contributions must generally be maintained for a period of ten years. However, with regulatory approval, a mortgage insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed 35 of net premiums earned in a calendar year. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no capital contributions were made to our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries and Essent Guaranty paid dividends to Essent US Holdings, Inc. of 165.5 million and 260 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no capital contributions were made to our title insurance subsidiary. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Essent US Holdings made a capital contribution of 6 million to its title insurance subsidiary. 
 
 Essent Guaranty has entered into reinsurance agreements that provide excess of loss reinsurance coverage for new defaults on portfolios of mortgage insurance policies issued from January 1, 2018 through August 31, 2019 and August 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverages decrease over a ten-year period as the underlying covered mortgages amortize.

 Essent Guaranty has entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement with a panel of third-party reinsurers ("QSR" agreement"). Each of the third-party reinsurers has an insurer minimum financial strength rating of A- or better by S P Global Ratings, AM Best or both. Under each QSR agreement, Essent Guaranty will cede premiums on a percentage of risk on all eligible policies written during a specified period, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claims expenses on covered policies, a specific ceding commission, as well as a profit commission that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. These reinsurance coverages also reduces net risk in force and PMIERs Minimum Required Assets. See Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The following tables summarizes Essent Guaranty's QSR agreements as of September 30, 2024: QSR Agreement Coverage Period Ceding Percentage Ceding Commission Profit Commission QSR-2019 September 1, 2019 - December 31, 2020 (1) 26 (2) 62.5 (2) QSR-2022 January 1, 2022 - December 31, 2022 20 20 62 QSR-2023 January 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023 17.5 20 58 QSR-2024 January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024 15.0 20 57 
 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Under QSR-2019, Essent Guaranty cedes 40 of premiums on singles policies and 20 on all other policies. 
 (2) The original profit commission on QSR-2019 was up to 60 ; however because Essent Guaranty did not exercise its option to terminate this QSR agreement on December 31, 2021, the maximum profit commission that Essent Guaranty could earn increased to 63 in 2022 through June 30, 2024. Effective July 1, 2024, Essent Guaranty renegotiated the terms, extending the termination date for QSR-2019 through December 31, 2027. The renegotiated terms increased the ceding commission from 20 to 26 and decreased the maximum profit commission from 63 to 62.5 . 
 
 Our combined risk-to-capital calculation for our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024 was as follows:

 For additional information regarding regulatory capital, see Note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our combined statutory capital equals the sum of statutory capital of Essent Guaranty plus Essent PA, after eliminating the impact of intercompany transactions. The combined risk-to-capital ratio equals the sum of the net risk in force of Essent Guaranty and Essent PA divided by combined statutory capital. The information above has been derived from the annual and quarterly statements of our insurance subsidiaries, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. Such practices vary from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

 Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements 
 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, maintain coordinated Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements, which we refer to as the "PMIERs." The PMIERs represent the standards by which private mortgage insurers are eligible to provide mortgage insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The PMIERs include financial strength requirements incorporating a risk-based framework that require approved insurers to have a sufficient level of liquid assets from which to pay claims. This risk-based framework provides that an insurer must hold a substantially higher level of required assets for insured loans that are in default compared to a performing loan. The PMIERs also include enhanced operational performance expectations and define remedial actions that apply should an approved insurer fail to comply with these requirements. As of September 30, 2024, Essent Guaranty, our GSE-approved mortgage insurance company, was in compliance with the PMIERs. As of September 30, 2024, Essent Guaranty's Available Assets were 3.6 billion or 189 of its Minimum Required Assets of 1.9 billion based on our interpretation of the PMIERs. 
 
 Under PMIERs guidance issued by the GSEs effective June 30, 2020, Essent will apply a 0.30 multiplier to the risk-based required asset amount factor for each insured loan in default backed by a property located in a FEMA Declared Major Disaster Area eligible for Individual Assistance and that either 1) is subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to a FEMA Declared Major Disaster, the terms of which are materially consistent with terms of forbearance plans, repayment plans or loan modification trial period offered by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or 2) has an initial missed payment occurring up to either (i) 30 days prior to the first day of the incident period specified in the FEMA Major Disaster Declaration or (ii) 90 days following the last day of the incident period specified in the FEMA Major Disaster Declaration, not to exceed 180 days from the first day of the incident period specified in the FEMA Major Disaster Declaration. In the case of the foregoing, the 0.30 multiplier shall be applied to the risk-based required asset amount factor for a non-performing primary mortgage guaranty insurance loan for no longer than three calendar months beginning with the month the loan becomes a non-performing primary mortgage guaranty insurance loan by reaching two missed monthly payments absent a forbearance plan described in 1) above. Further, under temporary provisions provided by the PMIERs guidance, Essent will apply a 0.30 multiplier to the risk-based required asset amount factor for each insured loan in default backed by a property that has an initial missed payment occurring on or after March 1, 2020 and prior to April 1, 2021 (COVID-19 Crisis Period). The 0.30 multiplier will be applicable for insured loans in default 1) subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19 (which shall be assumed to be the case for any loan that has an initial missed payment occurring during the COVID-19 Crisis Period and is subject to a forbearance plan, repayment plan or loan modification trial period), the terms of which are materially consistent with terms offered by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or 2) for no longer than three calendar months beginning with the month the loan becomes a non-performing primary mortgage guaranty insurance loan by reaching two missed monthly payments. 
 
 FHFA and the GSEs announced that effective November 1, 2023, defaulted loans will be no longer eligible for COVID forbearance plans and will follow the GSEs standard forbearance plans going forward. In August 2024, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under the oversight of FHFA, issued an update to the planned sunset of the use of the 0.3x Required Asset multiplier for loans in a COVID forbearance plan. The sunset of the 0.3x Required Asset multiplier for loans in a COVID forbearance plan will become effective on March 31, 2025. Also in August 2024, the GSEs, issued updates to the PMIERs calculation of Available Assets . The updated PMIERs Available Asset requirements are subject to a phased-in implementation, will have no impact on Essent s Available Assets or sufficiency ratio until March 31, 2025, and will become fully effective on September 30, 2026. Essent expects to remain in full compliance with the existing and updated PMIERs requirements. 

Financial Condition 
 
 Stockholders Equity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, stockholders equity was 5.6 billion, compared to 5.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. Stockholders' equity increased primarily due to net income generated in 2024 and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to an increase in our net unrealized investment losses, partially offset by dividends paid and the repurchase of common shares under our share repurchase plan.

Investments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, investments totaled 6.2 billion compared to 5.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. In addition, our total cash was 109.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 141.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in investments was primarily due to investing net cash flows from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as well as a decrease in our net unrealized investment losses.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Essent Guaranty has entered into fully collateralized reinsurance agreements ("Radnor Re Transactions") with unaffiliated special purpose insurers domiciled in Bermuda. The Radnor Re special purpose insurers are special purpose variable interest entities that are not consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements because we do not have the unilateral power to direct those activities that are significant to their economic performance. As of September 30, 2024, our estimated off-balance sheet maximum exposure to loss from the Radnor Re entities was 0.3 million, representing the estimated net present value of investment earnings on the assets in the reinsurance trusts. See Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We own and manage a large investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. Investment income is one of our primary sources of cash flow supporting operations and claim payments. The assets within the investment portfolio are exposed to the same factors that affect overall financial market performance. While our investment portfolio is exposed to factors affecting markets worldwide, it is most sensitive to fluctuations in the drivers of U.S. markets. 
 
 We manage market risk via defined investment policy implemented by our treasury function with oversight from our board of directors and our senior management. Important drivers of our market risk exposure monitored and managed by us include but are not limited to: 
 
 Changes to the level of interest rates. Increasing interest rates may reduce the value of certain fixed-rate bonds held in the investment portfolio. Higher rates may cause variable-rate assets to generate additional income. Decreasing rates will have the reverse impact. Significant changes in interest rates can also affect persistency and claim rates which may in turn require that the investment portfolio be restructured to better align it with future liabilities and claim payments. Such restructuring may cause investments to be liquidated when market conditions are adverse. 
 
 Changes to the term structure of interest rates. Rising or falling rates typically change by different amounts along the yield curve. These changes may have unforeseen impacts on the value of certain assets. 
 
 Market volatility/changes in the real or perceived credit quality of investments. Deterioration in the quality of investments, identified through changes to our own or third-party (e.g., rating agency) assessments, will reduce the value and potentially the liquidity of investments. 
 
 Concentration Risk. If the investment portfolio is highly concentrated in one asset, or in multiple assets whose values are highly correlated, the value of the total portfolio may be greatly affected by the change in value of just one asset or a group of highly correlated assets. 
 
 Prepayment Risk. Bonds may have call provisions that permit debtors to repay prior to maturity when it is to their advantage. This typically occurs when rates fall below the interest rate of the debt. 
 
 Market risk is measured for all investment assets at the individual security level. Market risks that are not fully captured by the quantitative analysis are highlighted. In addition, material market risk changes that occur from the last reporting period to the current are discussed. Changes to how risks are managed will also be identified and described. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the effective duration of our investments available for sale was 3.7 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 3.7 in fair value of our investments available for sale. Excluding short-term investments, our investments available for sale effective duration was 4.3 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 4.3 in fair value of our investments available for sale. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
