was due from TechTarget. 
 
 lawsuits have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by purported stockholders of the Company, each naming the Company and the members of its board of directors as defendants (the Complaints ). The first action is captioned Catherine Coffman v. TechTarget, Inc. et al., 655891/2024, and was filed on . The second action is captioned Susan Finger v. TechTarget, Inc. et al., 655885/2024, and was also filed on . The Complaints claim that the Definitive Proxy Statement is materially incomplete and misleading in violation of New York common law. In particular, the Complaints generally allege that the Definitive Proxy Statement contains materially misleading and incomplete information concerning, among other things: (i) the Company s, Informa Tech s, and the pro forma company s financial projections; (ii) the data and inputs underlying the financial analyses of the Company s financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC J.P. Morgan and (iii) potential conflicts of interest between Company insiders and BrightTower Securities, LLC BrightTower ). The Complaints also seek to enjoin the transaction, rescind the transaction should it be consummated or an award of damages if the transaction is consummated, and an award of fees and expenses. 

The Company has also received correspondence from law firms claiming to represent purported stockholders, who have threatened litigation and/or made other demands relating to the Merger, including that additional disclosures be provided (the Litigation Matters ). The Company cannot predict whether any of such demands or threats will result in litigation, whether additional demands or litigation may materialize, or the outcome of any such litigation relating to the Merger. If additional similar complaints are filed or additional demands are received, absent new or materially different allegations, the Company will not necessarily disclose them. 

The Company and other named defendants in the Complaints deny that they have violated any laws or breached any duties to the Company s stockholders, and the Company denies all allegations in the Litigation Matters. The Company believes that no supplemental disclosure to the Definitive Proxy Statement was or is required under any applicable law, rule or regulation. However, solely to eliminate the burden and expense of litigation, to moot the plaintiff s disclosure claims, and to avoid potential delay or disruption to the Merger, the Company has determined to voluntarily supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement. The Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the Definitive Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, and nothing shall otherwise be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosures set forth herein.

Additional information about us is included in the documents incorporated by reference into this report. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements, including: statements regarding the expected timing and structure of the proposed transaction; the ability of the parties to complete the Transactions considering the various closing conditions; the expected benefits of the Transactions, such as improved operations, enhanced revenues and cash flow, synergies, growth potential, market profile, business plans, expanded portfolio and financial strength; the competitive ability and position of our business following completion of the Transactions; legal, economic, and regulatory conditions; and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements concern future circumstances and results and other statements that are not historical facts and are sometimes identified by the words may, will, should, potential, intend, expect, endeavor, seek, anticipate, estimate, overestimate, underestimate, believe, plan, could, would, project, predict, continue, target, or the negatives of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern TechTarget s or our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements are based upon current plans, estimates, and expectations that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. We can give no assurance that such plans, estimates, or expectations will be achieved, and therefore, actual results may differ materially from any plans, estimates, or expectations in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans, estimates, or expectations include, among others: that one or more closing conditions to the Transactions, including certain regulatory approvals, may not be satisfied or waived, on a timely basis or otherwise, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay, or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the Transactions, may require conditions, limitations, or restrictions in connection with such approvals or that the required approval by the shareholders of TechTarget may not be obtained; the risk that the Transactions may not be completed in the time frame expected by us, TechTarget or Informa, or at all; unexpected costs, charges, or expenses resulting from the Transactions; uncertainty of our expected financial performance following completion of the Transactions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including as a result of delay in completing the Transactions or integrating the relevant portion of Informa tech digital businesses with the business of TechTarget; our ability to implement its business strategy; difficulties and delays in achieving revenue and cost synergies; the occurrence of any event that could give rise to termination of the Transactions; potential litigation in connection with the Transactions or other settlements or investigations that may affect the timing or occurrence of the Transactions or result in significant costs of defense, indemnification, and liability; evolving legal, regulatory, and tax regimes; changes in economic, financial, political, and regulatory conditions, in the United States and elsewhere, and other factors that contribute to uncertainty and volatility, natural and man-made disasters, civil unrest, pandemics, geopolitical uncertainty, and conditions that may result from legislative, regulatory, trade, and policy changes associated with the current or subsequent U.S. administration; risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the Transactions; certain restrictions during the pendency of the Transactions that may impact TechTarget s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; our, TechTarget s and Informa s ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the Transactions; the risk that any announcements relating to the Transactions could have adverse effects on the market price of TechTarget s common stock; the risk that the Transactions and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of TechTarget to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders, strategic partners and other business relationships and on its operating results and business generally; market acceptance of TechTarget s and the relevant portion of Informa Tech digital businesses products and services; the impact of pandemics and future health epidemics and any related economic downturns, on TechTarget s business and the markets in which it and its customers operate; changes in economic or regulatory conditions or other trends affecting the internet, internet advertising and information technology industries; data privacy and artificial intelligence laws, rules, and regulations; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates; certain macroeconomic factors facing the global economy, including instability in the regional banking sector, disruptions in the capital markets, economic sanctions and economic slowdowns or recessions, rising inflation and interest rate fluctuations on TechTarget s and the relevant portion of Informa Tech digital businesses results and other matters included in TechTarget s filings with the SEC, including in Item 1A of its Annual 
 9 

Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the Transactions, are more fully discussed the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus filed on October 25, 2024 and may be contained in other relevant materials that are filed or will be filed with the SEC (when they become available). While the list of factors presented here and in the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements as they are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual performance and outcomes, including, without limitation, our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of new markets or market segments in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this communication. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this communication. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or developments, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Neither future distribution of this communication nor the continued availability of this communication in archive form on TechTarget s website at investor.techtarget.com or Informa s website at www.informa.com/investors should be deemed to constitute an update or re-affirmation of these statements as of any future date. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 The Company has also received correspondence from law firms claiming to represent purported stockholders, who have threatened litigation and/or made other demands relating to the Merger, including that additional disclosures be provided (the Litigation Matters).
