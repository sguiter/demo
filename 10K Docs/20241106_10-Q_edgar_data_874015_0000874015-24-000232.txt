Overview

For three decades as a pioneer in RNA-targeted medicines, we have focused on bringing better futures to people with serious diseases.
 Today, we continue to drive innovation in RNA therapies. A deep understanding of disease biology and an industry-leading drug discovery technology propels our work, coupled with a passion and urgency to deliver better futures for patients.

We currently have five marketed medicines to treat serious diseases: SPINRAZA (nusinersen), QALSODY (tofersen), WAINUA (eplontersen),
 TEGSEDI (inotersen) and WAYLIVRA (volanesorsen). We also have a rich innovative late- and mid-stage pipeline in neurology, cardiology and other areas of high patient need. We currently have nine medicines in Phase 3 development and multiple additional
 medicines in early and mid-stage development.

We are using our multiple sources of revenue and our capital structure to continue investing in our commercial readiness efforts for
 multiple late-stage programs, our innovative pipeline and our technology. By continuing to focus on these priorities, we believe we are well positioned to drive future growth and to bring next-level value to patients and shareholders.

Marketed Medicines

SPINRAZA is an antisense medicine for the treatment of
 patients with spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, a progressive, debilitating and often fatal genetic disease. Our partner, Biogen, is responsible for commercializing SPINRAZA worldwide . From inception through September 30, 2024, we have earned more than 2.2
 billion in revenues from our SPINRAZA collaboration, including more than 1.8 billion in royalties on sales of SPINRAZA.

QALSODY is an antisense medicine that received accelerated approval from the United States, or U.S., Food and Drug Administration, or FDA,
 in April 2023 and marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in May 2024 for the treatment of adult patients with superoxide dismutase 1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or SOD1-ALS, a rare,
 neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive loss of motor neurons leading to death. Our partner, Biogen, is responsible for commercializing QALSODY worldwide.

WAINUA (WAINZUA in Europe) is a once monthly, self-administered subcutaneous LIgand-Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, medicine that is
 approved in the U.S. and other countries for the treatment of adults with polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or ATTRv-PN, a debilitating, progressive, and fatal disease. In addition, WAINUA recently received a positive
 opinion supporting marketing authorization from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. WAINUA is the only approved medicine for the treatment of ATTRv-PN that can be self-administered via an auto-injector. We and AstraZeneca are
 commercializing WAINUA in the U.S. with the launch having commenced in January 2024. We and AstraZeneca are seeking regulatory approval for WAINUA in other parts of the world. AstraZeneca has exclusive rights to commercialize WAINUA outside of the U.S.

23 

Index 

TEGSEDI is a once weekly, self-administered subcutaneous medicine approved in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil for the treatment of
 patients with ATTRv-PN. We currently sell TEGSEDI in Europe through our distribution agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi. In October 2023, our agreement for TEGSEDI in North America was terminated and Sobi began transitioning
 responsibilities to us. Following the transition, we discontinued TEGSEDI in North America in 2024. In Latin America, PTC Therapeutics International Limited, or PTC, is commercializing TEGSEDI in Brazil and is pursuing access in additional Latin
 American countries through its exclusive license agreement with us.

WAYLIVRA is a once weekly, self-administered, subcutaneous medicine approved in Europe and Brazil as an adjunct to diet in adult patients
 with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, and at high risk for pancreatitis. We sell WAYLIVRA in Europe through our distribution agreement with Sobi. In Latin America, PTC is commercializing WAYLIVRA in Brazil for two
 indications, FCS and familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL, and is pursuing access in additional Latin American countries through its exclusive license agreement with us.

Medicines in Registration and Phase 3 Studies

We currently have nine medicines in registration or Phase 3 studies for eleven indications, which are:

WAINUA (WAINZUA in Europe) is our medicine to treat patients with transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR, that is approved in the U.S., Canada
 and United Kingdom, or UK, for the treatment of adults with ATTRv-PN and is under regulatory review in other countries. The approval of WAINUA for ATTRv-PN was based on the positive results from the Phase 3 NEURO-TTRansform study showing that WAINUA
 halted disease progression and continuously improved quality of life at the 35-, 66- and 85-week analyses, which were published in the Journal of the
 American Medical Association , or JAMA . We launched WAINUA for the treatment of adults with ATTRv-PN in the U.S. in January 2024 and in
 Canada in October 2024 after securing a reimbursement program. In October 2024, WAINZUA was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, for the treatment of adults with ATTRv-PN in the UK with an accelerated National
 Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, recommendation. Additionally, in October 2024, WAINUA received a positive opinion supporting marketing authorization from CHMP. We are also developing WAINUA for ATTR cardiomyopathy, or ATTR-CM. We
 continue to progress our Phase 3 development program of WAINUA for ATTR-CM, with enrollment completed in the Phase 3 CARDIO-TTRansform study in July 2023 and data is expected in the second half of 2026. The FDA granted Fast Track designation to WAINUA
 for the treatment of patients with ATTR-CM in February 2024. Additionally, the FDA and EMA granted Orphan Drug designation to WAINUA for the treatment of ATTR in January 2022 and October 2023, respectively.

Olezarsen is our medicine in development for FCS, an ultra-rare indication, and severe hypertriglyceridemia, or sHTG, a much broader
 indication. Olezarsen is currently under Priority Review in the U.S. with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date of December 19, 2024 for FCS. Our regulatory submission was based on the positive results from the Phase 3 Balance study
 in patients with FCS showing statistically significant triglyceride lowering and a substantial reduction in acute pancreatitis events in addition to a favorable safety and tolerability profile that we reported in September 2023 and presented and
 published in the New England Journal of Medicine , or NEJM , in April 2024. We opened our Expanded Access Program for patients with FCS in the U.S. in April 2024. Olezarsen has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation, Orphan Drug designation and Fast Track designation for the
 treatment of FCS by the FDA. We are currently conducting a broad Phase 3 development program for olezarsen for the treatment of sHTG including three Phase 3 studies supporting development (CORE, CORE2 and ESSENCE), which achieved full enrollment in
 2024.

Donidalorsen is our medicine in development for the prophylactic treatment of hereditary angioedema, or HAE. Donidalorsen is currently
 under regulatory review in the U.S. with a PDUFA action date of August 21, 2025. Our regulatory submission was based on the positive results from our comprehensive Phase 2 and Phase 3 development program for donidalorsen. This included the Phase 3
 OASIS-HAE study in patients treated every four weeks and every eight weeks that were simultaneously published in NEJM , and positive results from
 OASISplus, our trial that includes an open-label, or OLE, cohort for patients rolling over from the Phase 3 study and a separate cohort for patients who have transitioned to donidalorsen from other prophylactic HAE medications that we refer to as the
 switch study. In December 2023 and June 2024, we licensed commercialization rights for donidalorsen to Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Otsuka, in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, respectively. Otsuka is preparing to submit a Marketing
 Authorization Application, or MAA, to the EMA. Donidalorsen was granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and EMA.

Zilganersen is our medicine in development for Alexander disease, or AxD. We completed enrollment in the Phase 3 portion of the ongoing
 study for patients with AxD in July 2024. Zilganersen was granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of AxD and Rare Pediatric designation by the FDA. Additionally, zilganersen was granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and EMA.

Index 

Ulefnersen is our medicine in development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, with mutations in the fused in sarcoma gene, or FUS.
 We are currently conducting a Phase 3 study of ulefnersen in juvenile and adult patients with FUS-ALS. Ulefnersen was granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and EMA.

QALSODY is our medicine to treat patients with SOD1-ALS that is marketed by Biogen. QALSODY was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in
 April 2023 and marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances by the EMA in May 2024 for patients with SOD1-ALS. Biogen is also evaluating QALSODY as a potential treatment for presymptomatic SOD1-ALS patients in the ongoing ATLAS study.
 QALSODY was granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and EMA.

Pelacarsen is our medicine in development to treat patients with elevated lipoprotein(a)-driven cardiovascular disease, or Lp(a)-driven
 CVD. Novartis is developing pelacarsen, including conducting the ongoing Lp(a) HORIZON Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in patients with elevated Lp(a)-driven CVD, which achieved full enrollment in July 2022 with more than 8,000 patients.
 Pelacarsen was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.

Bepirovirsen is our medicine in development for chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV. GSK is developing bepirovirsen, including conducting
 the ongoing B-Well Phase 3 program in patients with HBV, which achieved full enrollment in June 2024. GSK reported positive results from Phase 2 studies in 2023, including durable response data from the Phase 2 B-Sure long-term follow-up study of
 bepirovirsen in complete responder patients from the Phase 2b B-Clear study of patients with HBV. The FDA granted Fast Track designation and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare granted SENKU designation to bepirovirsen for the treatment
 of patients with HBV.

IONIS-FB-L Rx is our medicine in development for immunoglobulin A, or IgA, nephropathy, or IgAN. In the second quarter of 2023,
 Roche advanced IONIS-FB-L Rx into Phase 3 development in patients with IgAN based on interim Phase 2 data. In October 2024, we reported positive data from the Phase 2 study of IONIS-FB-L Rx in patients with IgAN.

Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. As
 such, we make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, based upon the information available to us. These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may
 significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations and financial condition. Each quarter, our senior management reviews the development, selection and disclosure of such estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. The
 following are our significant accounting estimates, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:

Assessing the propriety of revenue recognition and associated deferred revenue;

Determining the appropriate cost estimates for unbilled preclinical studies and clinical development activities; and

Assessing the appropriate estimate of anticipated future royalty payments under our royalty purchase agreement

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from the information provided in Item 7, Management s Discussion
 and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Commercial revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a new source of royalty revenue with the launch of
 WAINUA in the U.S. in late January 2024. Our commercial revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also included royalties from the net sales of QALSODY, which Biogen launched in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2023 and in
 the EU in the second quarter of 2024. SPINRAZA product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 increased slightly in the U.S. and decreased outside of the U.S. primarily due to an annual order from a
 single country that did not recur in 2024.

R D revenue was relatively consistent in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and increased
 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the amortization of upfront payments from the new collaborations with Roche and Novartis that we entered into during the second half of 2023. In addition,
 license fees increased year over year as a result of new collaborations we entered into during the second quarter of 2024, including the expanded donidalorsen licensing agreement with Otsuka, which now includes the Asia-Pacific region in addition to
 Europe. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in WAINUA joint development revenue, which decreased as development activities relating to ATTRv-PN wound down with the launch of WAINUA for this indication.

WAINUA (Eplontersen) Collaboration with AstraZeneca

Our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflected the cost-sharing provisions related to our collaboration with AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize WAINUA for the treatment of ATTR. Under the terms of the collaboration
 agreement, AstraZeneca is currently paying 55 percent of the costs associated with the ongoing global Phase 3 development program. Because we are leading and conducting the Phase 3 development program, we are recognizing as R D revenue the 55
 percent of cost-share funding AstraZeneca is responsible for, net of our share of AstraZeneca s development expenses, in the same period we incur the related development expenses.

As AstraZeneca is responsible for the majority of the medical affairs and commercial costs in the U.S. and all costs associated with
 bringing WAINUA to market outside the U.S., we are recognizing cost-share funding we receive from AstraZeneca related to these activities as a reduction of our medical affairs and commercialization expenses, which we classify as R D and selling,
 general and administrative, or SG A expenses, respectively. We expect our medical affairs and commercialization expenses to increase with the launch of WAINUA for ATTRv-PN in the U.S. and as WAINUA advances toward the market for ATTR-CM under our
 collaboration with AstraZeneca.

 decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to a one-time expense of 18 million related to a lease agreement termination in the third quarter of 2023, and increased in the nine months ended September
 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the launch of WAINUA in the U.S. and launch preparation activities for olezarsen and donidalorsen, including establishing the field team for olezarsen. Our R D expenses were relatively consistent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 as several late-stage studies have ended. We expect
 our operating expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards, to continue to increase during the remainder of 2024 as we advance our commercialization activities.

To analyze and compare our results of operations to other similar companies, we believe it is important to exclude non-cash compensation
 expense related to equity awards from our operating expenses. We believe non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards is not indicative of our operating results or cash flows from our operations. Further, we internally evaluate the
 performance of our operations excluding it . 

Cost of Sales

Our cost of sales is comprised of costs related to our TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA revenue, which consisted of manufacturing costs, including

Index 

Our drug development expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards, were relatively consistent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 . We expect our development expenses will continue to be stable as several
 late-stage studies end and we reallocate resources toward earlier stage programs.

We may conduct multiple clinical trials on a drug candidate, including multiple clinical trials for the various indications we may be
 studying. Furthermore, as we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain drug candidates in certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising drug candidates or indications. Our Phase 1 and
 Phase 2 programs are clinical research programs that fuel our Phase 3 pipeline. When our medicines are in Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials, they are in a dynamic state in which we may adjust the development strategy for each medicine. Although we may
 characterize a medicine as in Phase 1 or in Phase 2, it does not mean that we are conducting a single, well-defined study with dedicated resources. Instead, we allocate our internal resources on a shared basis across numerous medicines based on
 each medicine s particular needs at that time. This means we are constantly shifting resources among medicines. Therefore, what we spend on each medicine during a particular period is usually a function of what is required to keep the medicines
 progressing in clinical development, not what medicines we think are most important. For example, the number of people required to start a new study is large, the number of people required to keep a study going is modest and the number of people
 required to finish a study is large. However, such fluctuations are not indicative of a shift in our emphasis from one medicine to another and cannot be used to accurately predict future costs for each medicine. Because we always have numerous
 medicines in preclinical and varying stages of clinical research, the fluctuations in expenses from medicine to medicine, in large part, offset one another. If we partner a medicine, it may affect the size of a trial, its timing, its total cost and the
 timing of the related costs.

Medical Affairs

Manufacturing and development chemistry expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards, were relatively consistent in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
 same period in 2023 due to the timing of manufacturing performed by our contract manufacturing organizations for drug product related to several late-stage programs.

R D Support 

In our research, development and patent expenses, we include support costs such as rent, repair and maintenance for buildings and
 equipment, utilities, depreciation of laboratory equipment and facilities, amortization of our intellectual property, information technology costs, procurement costs and waste disposal costs. We call these costs R D support expenses .

 result, beginning in the second quarter of 2023, our interest expense related to our convertible notes increased because we began incurring interest expense for our 1.75 Notes.

Interest Expense Related to Sale of Future Royalties

We recorded 18.5 million and 54.8 million of interest expense related to the sale of future royalties in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to 17.8 million and 50.9 million in the same periods in 2023 , respectively. These amounts are related to the Royalty Pharma transaction, in which we sold a minority interest in our future SPINRAZA and pelacarsen royalties to Royalty Pharma for a 500
 million upfront payment and 625 million of potential future payments. Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 11, Liability Related to Sale of Future

Other Income

In 2023, we completed a 575.0 million offering of our 1.75 Notes and used 488.2 million of the net proceeds to repurchase 504.4
 million in principal of our 0.125 Notes. As a result of these repurchases, we recorded a 13.4 million gain on early retirement of debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects the difference between the amount we paid to repurchase
 a portion of our 0.125 Notes and the net carrying balance of the liability at the time that we repurchased the debt. Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 12, Convertible
 Debt , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our convertible debt.

Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

We recorded income tax benefit of 3.6
 million and 3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to income tax expense of 6.6 million and 25.8 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively.

The benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relates to the 2023 tax return position for the royalty
 purchase agreement with Royalty Pharma that we finalized during the third quarter of 2024. We reflected the Royalty Pharma transaction as a taxable sale, which required us to include the proceeds from the sale, net of currently deductible issuance
 costs, as taxable income in 2023.

The decrease in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 relates
 primarily to the impact of the Royalty Pharma transaction.

We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on all our net deferred tax assets.

Net Loss and Net Loss
 per Share 

We had a net loss of 140.5
 million and 349.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. We
 had a net loss of 147.4 million and 357.0
 million for the same periods in 2023. The period-over-period
 fluctuations in our net loss were driven by factors discussed in the sections above. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.95 and 2.38 , respectively, compared to 1.03 and 2.50 
 for the same periods in 2023 . The period-over-period fluctuations in our net loss per share were primarily driven by factors discussed in the sections above and partially driven by the increase in our
 weighted-average number of common shares outstanding due to the issuance of 11.5 million shares of common stock from our public offering in September 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have financed our operations primarily from research and
 development collaborative agreements. We also financed our operations from revenue from SPINRAZA and QALSODY royalties and TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA commercial revenue. In addition, we began receiving commercial revenue from WAINUA royalties in 2024. From
 our inception through September 30, 2024 , we have earned
 approximately 7.7 billion in revenue. We have
 also financed our operations through the sale of our equity securities, the issuance of long-term debt and the sale of future royalties . From the time we were founded through September 30, 2024, we have raised net proceeds of approximately 2.6 billion from the sale of our equity securities, which includes our sale of 11.5 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of 489 million in September 2024. Additionally, from our inception through September 30, 2024 , we have borrowed approximately 2.7 billion under long-term
 debt arrangements and received proceeds of approximately 0.5 billion from the sale of future royalties to finance a portion of our operations.

From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 our working capital increased as our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased
 due to net proceeds from the public common stock offering in September 2024. During the same period, our long-term obligations did not change significantly.

In addition to contractual obligations, we had outstanding purchase orders as of September 30, 2024 for the purchase of services, capital equipment and materials as part of our normal course of
 business. 

We may enter into additional collaborations with partners which could provide for additional revenue to us and we may incur additional
 cash expenditures related to our obligations under any of the new agreements we may enter into. We currently intend to use our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to finance our activities. However, we may also pursue other financing
 alternatives, like issuing additional shares of our common stock, issuing debt instruments, refinancing our existing debt, securing lines of credit or executing royalty monetization agreements. Whether we use our existing capital resources or choose to
 obtain financing will depend on various factors, including the future success of our business, the prevailing interest rate environment and the condition of financial markets generally.

ITEM 3. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain short-term investments. We primarily invest our
 excess cash in highly liquid short-term investments of the U.S. Treasury and reputable financial institutions, corporations, and U.S. government agencies with strong credit ratings. We typically hold our investments for the duration of the term of the
 respective instrument. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments, positions or transactions to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Accordingly, we believe that,
 while the securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities, we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity
 prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments.

We are also exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as we have foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than
 the U.S. dollar. We translate our subsidiaries functional currencies into our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in the foreign
 currencies to U.S. dollar exchange rate, which are difficult to predict. A hypothetical 10 percent change in foreign exchange rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial
 statements.

ITEM 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in our Exchange
 Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
 Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We design and evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures recognizing that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
 provide only reasonable assurance and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

As of our most recently completed fiscal year and as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried
 out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, under the supervision and with the
 participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
 of September 30, 2024. There have been no significant changes in
 our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to September 30, 2024.

We also performed an evaluation of any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last
 fiscal quarter and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. We conducted this evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management,
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. That evaluation did not identify any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our latest fiscal quarter and that have materially affected, or are
 reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A. 

RISK FACTORS

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information
 about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our
 financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. We have marked with an asterisk those risk
 factors that reflect substantive changes from the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Summary of Risk Factors

There are a number of risks related to our business and our securities. Some of the principal risks related to our business include the
 following:

Our ability to generate substantial revenue from the sale of our medicines;

he availability of adequate coverage and payment rates for our medicines;

Our and our partners ability to compete effectively;

Our ability to successfully manufacture our medicines;

Our ability to successfully develop and obtain marketing approvals for our medicines;

Our ability to secure and maintain effective corporate partnerships;

Our ability to sustain cash flows and achieve consistent profitability;

Our ability to protect our intellectual property;

Our ability to maintain the effectiveness of our personnel;

The impacts of health epidemics, climate change, war and other global events;

Our dependence upon our own and third-party information technology systems;

Our compliance with laws; and

The other factors set forth below.

Risks Related to the Commercialization of our Medicines

We have limited experience as a company in commercializing medicines and we will have to continue to invest significant resources to
 develop our capabilities. If we are unable to establish effective marketing, sales, market access, distribution, and related functions, or enter into agreements with third parties to commercialize our medicines, we may not be able to generate revenue
 from our medicines.

We currently rely on third parties for the commercialization of our marketed medicines, have limited experience as a company in
 commercializing medicines and will have to continue to invest significant financial and management resources to develop the infrastructure required to successfully commercialize our medicines. There are significant risks involved in building and
 managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed
 sales and marketing team. We will also need to continue to scale-up existing internal support functions to aid our commercialization efforts, in particular, regulatory affairs and medical affairs. Any failure to effectively build or maintain the
 infrastructure required to successfully commercialize our medicines, including our sales, marketing, market access, distribution, and related capabilities, or scale-up our existing support functions, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from
 our medicines. In addition, if we choose to rely on third parties to assist us in commercializing our medicines, we may not be able to enter into collaborations or hire consultants or external service providers on acceptable financial terms, or at all.
 If we continue to engage third parties to assist us in the commercialization of our medicines, our product revenues and profitability may be lower than if we commercialized such medicines ourselves.

35 

Index 

If the market does not accept our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, we are not likely to
 generate substantial revenues or become consistently profitable.

Even if our medicines are authorized for marketing, our success will depend upon the medical community, patients and third-party payers
 accepting our medicines as medically useful, cost-effective, safe and convenient. Even when the United States, or U.S., Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities authorize our or our partners medicines for
 commercialization, doctors may not prescribe our medicines to treat patients. Furthermore, we and our partners may not successfully commercialize additional medicines.

Additionally, in many of the markets where we or our partners may sell our medicines in the future, if we or our partners cannot agree
 with the government or other third-party payers regarding the price we can charge for our medicines, we may not be able to sell our medicines in that market. Similarly, cost control initiatives by governments or third-party payers could decrease the
 price received for our medicines or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, economically unviable. If the pricing of any of our medicines decreases for any
 reason, it will reduce our revenue for such medicine. For example, Biogen has in the past disclosed that SPINRAZA revenue decreased in part due to lower pricing in the U.S. and certain rest-of-world markets.

The degree of market acceptance for our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, depends upon a
 number of factors, including the:

receipt and scope of marketing authorizations;

establishment and demonstration in the medical and patient community of the efficacy and safety of our medicines and their potential advantages over competing products;

cost and effectiveness of our medicines compared to other available therapies;

patient convenience of the dosing regimen for our medicines; and

reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers.

Based on the profile of our medicines, physicians, patients, patient advocates, payers or the medical community in general may not accept
 or use any of the medicines that we or our partners may develop.

For example, TEGSEDI requires periodic blood and urine monitoring and is available in the U.S. only through a risk evaluation and
 mitigation strategy, or REMS program. In addition, the product label for TEGSEDI in the U.S. has a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis. Our main external competitors in the U.S. market for TEGSEDI are patisiran and vutrisiran,
 both marketed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Neither patisiran nor vutrisiran has a boxed warning nor does either require use of a REMS program. Additionally, the product label for WAYLIVRA in the European Union, or EU, requires regular blood
 monitoring. In each case, these label requirements have negatively affected our ability to attract and retain patients for these medicines.

If government or other third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for our medicines, including our commercial
 medicines and our medicines in development, our revenue will be limited.

In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our current and future products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and
 reimbursement from third-party payers. The majority of patients in the U.S. who would fit within our target patient populations for our medicines have their healthcare supported by a combination of Medicare coverage, other government health programs
 such as Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new medicines when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are
 already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be enough to make our medicines affordable. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are
 attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Accordingly, our commercial medicines and our medicines in development will face competition from other therapies and medicines for limited financial
 resources. Furthermore, we or our partners may need to conduct post-marketing studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to satisfy third-party payers. These studies might require us to commit a significant amount of
 management time and financial and other resources. In addition, third-party payers may never consider our future products as cost-effective and adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels
 sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.

36 

Index 

Third-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of
 controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medicines exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for medicines can differ significantly from payer to payer. For
 example, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. There have
 been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. It is unclear how future litigation and healthcare reform measures will impact the ACA and our business.

Further, we believe that future coverage, reimbursement and
 pricing will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets. In the U.S., recent health reform measures have resulted in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and there have been several
 recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, legislation and executive orders designed to, among other things, reduce drug prices, increase competition (including by enhancing support for generic and biosimilar drugs), lower out-of-pocket drug costs for
 patients, curtail spread pricing practices by pharmacy benefit managers, and foster scientific innovation to promote better health care and improved health. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, includes key actions aimed at
 reducing the costs of prescription drugs and allows HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs covered under Medicare and establish a price cap on such drugs. Specifically, in an effort to curb Medicare patients out-of-pocket costs
 for prescription drugs, the Part D redesign legislation under the IRA requires, among other things, (1) a cap on out-of-pocket drug spending under Part D, (2) drug manufacturers to pay a rebate to the federal government if prices for drugs
 covered under Part D and Part B increase faster than the rate of inflation, and (3) drug manufacturers to contribute to the catastrophic coverage phase for Part D drugs as
 discounts through a manufacturer discount program. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023.
 On August 29, 2023, HHS announced the list of the first ten drugs that will be subject to price negotiations, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. In response to the Biden administration s
 October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the CMS Innovation Center which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve
 quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future. Further, on December 7, 2023, the Biden administration announced an initiative to control the price of prescription drugs using march-in
 rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. On December 8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published for comment a Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights which for the first time includes the
 price of a product as one factor an agency can use when deciding to exercise march-in rights. While march-in rights have not previously been exercised, it is uncertain if that will continue under the new framework. It is unclear whether or how these
 selected models or similar policy initiatives will impact prescription drug pricing in the future. 

Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private
 payers. Our future product sales may be subject to additional discounts from list price in the form of rebates and discounts provided to covered entities under the Public Health Service Act 340B drug pricing program. Changes to the 340B program or to
 Medicare or Medicaid programs at the federal or state level, including outcomes of ongoing litigation in our industry, may impact our product prices and rebate liability.

At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and
 biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from
 other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida s Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, proposal to import certain drugs from Canada for specific state healthcare programs. It is unclear how this
 program will be implemented, including which drugs will be chosen, and whether it will be subject to legal challenges in the United States or Canada. Other states have also submitted SIP proposals that are pending review by the FDA. Any such approved
 importation plans, when implemented, may result in lower drug prices for products covered by those programs. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for medicines may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets, which would
 negatively affect the potential commercial success of our products, our revenue and our profits.

37 

Index 

If we or our partners fail to compete effectively, our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development,
 will not generate significant revenues.

Our competitors engage in drug discovery throughout the world, are numerous, and include, among others, major pharmaceutical companies and
 specialized biopharmaceutical firms. In addition, other companies are engaged in developing RNA-targeted technology. Our competitors may succeed in developing medicines that are:

priced lower than our medicines;

reimbursed more favorably by government and other third-party payers than our medicines;

safer than our medicines;

more effective than our medicines; or

more convenient to use than our medicines.

These competitive developments could make our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, obsolete or
 non-competitive.

Certain of our partners are pursuing other technologies or developing other medicines either on their own or in collaboration with others,
 including our competitors, to treat some of the same diseases our own collaborative programs target. Competition may negatively impact a partner s focus on and commitment to our medicines and, as a result, could delay or otherwise negatively affect the
 commercialization of our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development.

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. In addition, many of these
 competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical testing and human clinical studies of new pharmaceutical products, in obtaining FDA and other regulatory authorizations of such products and in commercializing such
 products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory authorization for products earlier than we do or more successfully commercialize their products.

There are several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in the development or commercialization in certain geographic markets
 of products against targets that are also targets of products in our development pipeline. For example:

Onasemnogene abeparvovec and risdiplam compete with SPINRAZA;

Taldefgrobep alfa, Evrysdi + GYM329 and NMD670 could compete with SPINRAZA;

Patisiran, tafamidis, tafamidis meglumine and vutrisiran compete with TEGSEDI and WAINUA;

Acoramidis, NTLA-2001 and NNC6019-0001 could compete with TEGSEDI and WAINUA;

ARO-APOC3 and pegozafermin could compete with WAYLIVRA and olezarsen;

Lanadelumab-flyo, C1 esterase inhibitor, berotralstat, C1 esterase inhibitor subcutaneous,
 garadacimab, deucrictibant, NTLA-2002 and STAR-0215 could compete with donidalorsen;

SPINRAZA injection for intrathecal use is an antisense medicine indicated for the treatment of SMA patients of all ages approved in over
 50 countries. Specifically, SPINRAZA faces competition from onasemnogene abeparvovec, a gene therapy product that was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 and in the EU in May 2020 for the treatment of SMA, as well as risdiplam, an oral product for the
 treatment of SMA that was approved in the U.S. in August 2020 and in the EU in March 2021. Biogen has in the past disclosed that SPINRAZA revenue decreased due to a reduction in demand as a result of increased competition and that future sales of
 SPINRAZA may be adversely affected by competing products.

Index 

Additionally, companies that are developing medicines that
 target the same patient populations as our medicines in development may compete with us to enroll participants in the clinical trials for such medicines, which could make it more difficult for us to complete enrollment for these clinical trials .

Our medicines could be subject to regulatory limitations following approval.

Following approval of a medicine, we and our partners must comply with comprehensive government regulations regarding the manufacture,
 marketing and distribution of medicines. Promotional communications regarding prescription medicines must be consistent with the information in the product s approved labeling. We or our partners may not obtain the labeling claims necessary or
 desirable to successfully commercialize our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development.

The FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to impose significant restrictions on an approved medicine through the product
 label and on advertising, promotional and distribution activities. For example:

in the U.S., TEGSEDI s label contains a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis;

TEGSEDI requires periodic blood and urine monitoring; and

in the U.S., TEGSEDI is available only through a REMS program.

Prescription medicines may be promoted only for the approved indication(s) in accordance with the approved label. The FDA and other
 regulatory authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

In addition, when approved, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may condition approval on the performance of post-approval
 clinical studies or patient monitoring, which could be time consuming and expensive. For example, in connection with the conditional marketing approval for WAYLIVRA in the EU, we are required to conduct a post-authorization safety study to evaluate the
 safety of WAYLIVRA on thrombocytopenia and bleeding in FCS patients taking WAYLIVRA. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory, the FDA, EC or other foreign regulatory authorities may withdraw marketing authorization or may
 condition continued marketing on commitments from us or our partners that may be expensive and time consuming to fulfill.

If we or others identify side effects after any of our medicines are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur subsequent to
 regulatory approval, or if we, our CMOs or our partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we or our partners may, among other things, lose regulatory approval and be forced to withdraw products from the market, need to conduct additional
 clinical studies, incur restrictions on the marketing, distribution or manufacturing of the product, and/or change the labeling of our medicines.

We depend on our collaborations with Biogen for the development and commercialization of SPINRAZA and QALSODY.

We have entered into separate collaborative arrangements with Biogen to develop and commercialize SPINRAZA and QALSODY. We entered into
 these collaborations primarily to:

fund our development activities for SPINRAZA and QALSODY;

seek and obtain regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA and QALSODY; and

successfully commercialize SPINRAZA and QALSODY.

We are relying on Biogen to obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA and QALSODY, generate additional clinical data for
 SPINRAZA and QALSODY, manufacture SPINRAZA and QALSODY, and successfully commercialize SPINRAZA and QALSODY. In general, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that Biogen devotes to our collaborations. If Biogen fails to further develop
 SPINRAZA or QALSODY, obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA or QALSODY, manufacture SPINRAZA or QALSODY, or successfully commercialize SPINRAZA or QALSODY, or if Biogen s efforts in any of these respects are ineffective, revenues for
 SPINRAZA or QALSODY would be negatively affected.

In addition, our collaborations with Biogen may not continue for various reasons. Biogen can terminate our collaborations at any time. If
 Biogen stops developing or commercializing SPINRAZA or QALSODY, we would have to seek or spend additional funding, and SPINRAZA s or QALSODY s commercialization may be harmed.

39 

Index 

We depend on our collaboration with AstraZeneca for the joint development and commercialization of WAINUA.

We have entered into a collaborative arrangement with AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize WAINUA. Under the terms of the
 collaboration agreement, we and AstraZeneca will co-develop and co-commercialize WAINUA in the U.S. and AstraZeneca will have the sole right to commercialize WAINUA in all other countries. As a company we do not have experience with
 co-commercialization arrangements. We also do not have control over the amount and timing of resources that AstraZeneca devotes to our collaboration, particularly outside of the U.S. If the co-commercialization arrangement for WAINUA is not successful
 for any reason, WAINUA may not meet our commercial objectives and our revenues for WAINUA may be limited.

In addition, a Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, having equal membership from us and AstraZeneca, and various subcommittees oversee and
 coordinate the development, manufacturing, commercialization and other exploitation activities for WAINUA in the U.S. by mutual agreement. If any subcommittee cannot reach unanimous agreement on any matter within its respective scope of authority, such
 matter may be referred to the JSC for resolution. If the JSC cannot come to a mutual agreement on any particular matter, this could delay our ability to develop or commercialize WAINUA.

If we are not successful in expanding our manufacturing capabilities or cannot manufacture our medicines or contract with a third party to
 manufacture our medicines at costs that allow us to charge competitive prices to buyers, we cannot market our products profitably.

To successfully commercialize any of our medicines, we need
 to optimize and manage large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities either on a standalone basis or through a third-party manufacturer. As our drug development and commercial pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for
 clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. While we believe our current capabilities and those we obtain through third-party manufacturers support our
 manufacturing needs now, it will be important to expand our manufacturing infrastructure in the future, which will likely require substantial expenditures. If we are not successful in executing this expansion, it could limit our ability to meet our
 manufacturing requirements and commercial objectives in the future. 

In addition, we have limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products of the chemical class represented by our medicines, called
 oligonucleotides, on a commercial scale for the systemic administration of a medicine. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our medicines, and some of these suppliers will need
 to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing. Further, we must continue to improve our manufacturing processes to allow us to reduce our drug costs. We or our partners may not be able to manufacture our
 medicines at a cost or in quantities necessary to make commercially successful products.

Manufacturers, including us, must adhere to the FDA s cGMP regulations and similar regulations in foreign countries, which the applicable
 regulatory authorities enforce through facilities inspection programs. We, our partners and our contract manufacturers may not comply or maintain compliance with cGMP, or similar foreign regulations. Non-compliance could significantly delay or prevent
 receipt of marketing authorizations for our medicines, including authorizations for our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, or could result in enforcement action after authorization that might limit the commercial success of our
 medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development.

We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply the drug
 substance and drug product for TEGSEDI and WAINUA and drug product for WAYLIVRA. Any delays or disruption to our own or third-party commercial manufacturing capabilities could limit the commercial success of our medicines .

Risks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of our Medicines

If we or our partners fail to obtain regulatory approval for our medicines and additional approvals for our commercial medicines, we or
 our partners cannot sell them in the applicable markets.

We cannot guarantee that any of our medicines will be considered safe and effective or will be approved for commercialization. In
 addition, it is possible that our commercial medicines may not be approved in additional markets or for additional indications. We and our partners must conduct time-consuming, extensive and costly clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and
 efficacy of each of our medicines before they can be approved or receive additional approvals for sale. We and our partners must conduct these studies in compliance with FDA regulations and with comparable regulations in other countries.

40 

Index 

We and our partners may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for our medicines. It is possible that
 regulatory authorities will not approve our medicines for marketing or our commercial medicines in additional markets or for additional indications. If the FDA or another regulatory authority believes that we or our partners have not sufficiently
 demonstrated the safety or efficacy of any of our medicines, including our commercial medicines or our medicines in development, the authority will not approve the specific medicine or will require additional studies, which could be time consuming and
 expensive and delay or harm commercialization of the medicine. For example, in August 2018 we received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the new drug application for WAYLIVRA in which the FDA determined that the safety concerns
 identified with WAYLIVRA in our clinical development program outweighed the expected benefits of triglyceride lowering in patients with FCS. We also received a Notice of Non-Compliance Withdrawal Letter, or Non-W, from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA in
 November 2018.

The FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a medicine for many reasons, including:

such authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical studies;

we or our partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a medicine is safe and effective for any indication;

such authorities may not accept clinical data from studies conducted at clinical facilities that have deficient clinical practices or that are in countries where the
 standard of care is potentially different from the U.S.;

we or our partners may be unable to demonstrate that our medicine s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks to support approval;

such authorities may disagree with the interpretation of data from preclinical or clinical studies;

such authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers who manufacture clinical and commercial supplies for our
 medicines; and

the approval policies or regulations of such authorities or their prior guidance to us or our partners during clinical development may significantly change in a manner
 rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.

Failure to receive marketing authorization for our medicines in development, or failure to receive additional marketing authorizations for
 our commercial medicines, or delays in these authorizations, could prevent or delay commercial introduction of the medicine, and, as a result, could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from product sales.

If the results of clinical testing indicate that any of our medicines are not suitable for commercial use, we may need to abandon one or
 more of our drug development programs.

Drug discovery and drug development have inherent risks and the historical failure rate for drugs is high. Antisense medicines are a
 relatively new approach to therapeutics. If we cannot demonstrate that our medicines are safe and effective for human use in the intended indication(s), we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.

Even if our medicines are successful in preclinical and human clinical studies, the medicines may not be successful in late-stage clinical
 studies.

Successful results in preclinical or initial human clinical studies, including the Phase 2 results for some of our medicines in
 development, may not predict the results of subsequent clinical studies. If any of our medicines in Phase 3 clinical studies do not show sufficient safety and efficacy in patients with the targeted indication, or if such studies are discontinued for
 any other reason, it could negatively impact our development and commercialization goals for these medicines and our stock price could decline.

In the past, we have invested in clinical studies of medicines that have not met the primary clinical endpoints in their Phase 3 studies
 or have been discontinued for other reasons. For example, in October 2021, Biogen reported that QALSODY did not meet the primary clinical endpoint in the Phase 3 VALOR study; however, trends favoring QALSODY were seen across multiple secondary and
 exploratory measures of disease activity and clinical function. In addition, in March 2021, Roche decided to discontinue dosing in the Phase 3 GENERATION HD1 study of tominersen in patients with manifest Huntington s disease based on the results of a
 pre-planned review of data from the Phase 3 study conducted by an unblinded Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Similar results could occur in clinical studies for our other medicines.

41 

Index 

There are a number of factors that could cause a clinical study to fail or be delayed, including:

the clinical study may produce negative or inconclusive results;

regulators may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for noncompliance with regulatory requirements;

we, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could suspend or terminate a clinical study due to adverse side effects of a medicine on subjects or lack of
 efficacy in the trial;

we or our partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical studies;

enrollment in our clinical studies may be slower than we anticipate;

we or our partners, including our independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers on which we rely, may not
 identify, recruit or train suitable clinical investigators at a sufficient number of study sites or timely enroll a sufficient number of study subjects in the clinical study;

the institutional review board for a prospective site might withhold or delay its approval for the study;

people who enroll in the clinical study may later drop out due to adverse events, a perception they are not benefiting from participating in the study, fatigue with the
 clinical study process or personal issues;

a clinical study site may deviate from the protocol for the study;

the cost of our clinical studies may be greater than we anticipate;

our partners may decide not to exercise any existing options to license and conduct additional clinical studies for our medicines; and

the supply or quality of our medicines or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical studies may be insufficient, inadequate or delayed.

Further, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could request, among other things, additional information or commitments before we can
 start or continue a clinical study, protocol amendments, increased safety monitoring, additional product labeling information, and post-approval commitments. This happened in connection with the conditional marketing approval for WAYLIVRA in the EU, as
 the EC is requiring us to conduct a post-authorization safety study to evaluate the safety of WAYLIVRA on thrombocytopenia and bleeding in FCS patients taking WAYLIVRA. In addition, under accelerated approval the FDA is requiring completion of the
 ongoing Phase 3 trial for QALSODY to confirm the clinical benefit of QALSODY.

Moreover, our commercial medicines are chemically similar to each other. As a result, a safety observation we encounter with one of our
 medicines could have, or be perceived by a regulatory authority to have, an impact on a different medicine we are developing. This could cause the FDA or other regulators to ask questions or take actions that could harm or delay our ability to develop
 and commercialize our medicines or increase our costs. Any failure or delay in our clinical studies could reduce the commercial potential or viability of our medicines.

We depend on third parties to conduct clinical studies for our medicines and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations
 could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans. 

We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct our
 clinical studies for our medicines and expect to continue to do so in the future. For example, we use clinical research organizations, such as Icon Clinical Research Limited, Medpace, Inc., Parexel International Corporation, Syneos Health, Inc. and
 Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for the clinical studies for our medicines, including WAINUA for the treatment of ATTR-CM, donidalorsen, olezarsen, ulefnersen and zilganersen. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical
 studies, but do not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators are not our employees, but we are responsible for ensuring that such investigators conduct each of our clinical studies in accordance with the general
 investigational plan and approved protocols for the study. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. For example, some of our key
 vendors have in the past experienced labor shortages, which impacted their ability to perform services for us for certain of our clinical trials. Subsequent failures of these third parties to carry out their obligations, or a termination of our
 relationship with such third parties, could delay or prevent the development, marketing authorization and commercialization of our medicines.

In addition, while we do not have any clinical trial sites in Russia, Ukraine or Gaza, we do have a limited number of clinical trial sites
 in Israel that may be materially impacted by the ongoing military conflicts in Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East and could result in difficulties enrolling or completing our clinical trials in such areas on schedule.

Since corporate partnering is a significant part of our strategy to fund the advancement and commercialization of our development
 programs, if any of our collaborative partners fail to fund our collaborative programs, or if we cannot obtain additional partners, we may have to delay or stop progress on our drug development programs.

To date, corporate partnering has played a significant role in our strategy to fund our development programs and to add key development
 resources. We plan to continue to rely on additional collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize some of our unpartnered medicines. However, we may not be able to negotiate favorable collaborative arrangements for these drug programs. If we
 cannot continue to secure additional collaborative partners, our revenues could decrease and the development of our medicines could suffer.

Our corporate partners are developing and funding many of the medicines in our development pipeline. For example, we are relying on:

AstraZeneca for the joint development and funding of WAINUA;

Novartis for development and funding of pelacarsen;

GSK for development and funding of bepirovirsen; and

Roche for development and funding of IONIS-FB-L Rx .

If any of these pharmaceutical companies stops developing and funding these medicines, our business could suffer and we may not have, or
 be willing to dedicate, the resources available to develop these medicines on our own. Our collaborators can terminate their relationships with us under certain circumstances, many of which are outside of our control. For example, in 2022, Pfizer and
 Bayer decided to discontinue the clinical development programs for vupanorsen and fesomersen, respectively.

Even with funding from corporate partners, if our partners do not effectively perform their obligations under our agreements with them, it
 would delay or stop the progress of our drug development and commercial programs.

In addition to receiving funding, we enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to:

conduct clinical studies;

seek and obtain marketing authorizations; and

manufacture and commercialize our medicines.

Once we have secured a collaborative arrangement to further develop and commercialize one of our drug development programs, such as our
 collaborations with AstraZeneca, Biogen, GSK, Novartis, Otsuka and Roche, these collaborations may not continue or result in commercialized medicines, or may not progress as quickly as we anticipated.

For example, a collaborator such as AstraZeneca, Biogen, GSK, Novartis, Otsuka or Roche, could determine that it is in its financial
 interest to:

pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products that may be competitive with the medicine that is part of the collaboration with us;

pursue higher-priority programs or change the focus of its own development programs; or

choose to devote fewer resources to our medicines than it does to its own medicines.

If any of these occur, it could affect our partner s commitment to the collaboration with us and could delay or otherwise negatively
 affect the commercialization of our medicines, including QALSODY, SPINRAZA, WAINUA, bepirovirsen, donidalorsen, IONIS-FB-L Rx and pelacarsen.

43 

Index 

We may not be able to benefit from Orphan Drug designation for our medicines.

In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a medicine as an Orphan Drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or
 condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process, but it can provide financial incentives, such as tax
 advantages and user-fee waivers, as well as longer regulatory exclusivity periods. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation to olezarsen for the treatment of patients with FCS, to ulefnersen for the treatment of patients with FUS-ALS, and to ION582
 for the treatment of patients with Angelman syndrome. The FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have granted Orphan Drug designation to WAINUA for the treatment of patients with ATTR, to donidalorsen for the treatment of patients with HAE, to
 TEGSEDI for the treatment of patients with ATTRv-PN, to WAYLIVRA for the treatment of patients with FCS, to tominersen for the treatment of patients with HD, and to ION356 for the treatment of patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. In addition,
 the EMA has granted Orphan Drug designation to WAYLIVRA for the treatment of patients with FPL. Even if approval is obtained on a medicine that has been designated as an Orphan Drug, we may lose Orphan Drug exclusivity if the FDA or EMA determines that
 the request for designation was materially defective or if we cannot assure sufficient quantity of the applicable medicine to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition, or if a competitor is able to gain approval for the same or a
 substantially similar medicine in a safer or more effective form or that makes a major contribution to patient care. If we lose Orphan Drug exclusivity on any of our medicines, we may face increased competition and lose market share for such medicine.

Risks Associated with our Businesses as a Whole

Risks related to our financial condition

If we fail to obtain timely funding, we may need to curtail or abandon some of our programs. 

Many of our medicines are undergoing clinical studies or are in the early stages of research and development. Most of our programs will
 require significant additional research, development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, marketing authorizations, preclinical activities and commitment of significant additional resources prior to their successful commercialization. In
 addition, as we commercialize more medicines on our own, we will need to invest significant financial resources to continue developing the infrastructure required to successfully commercialize our medicines, including the expansion of our manufacturing
 capabilities. All of these activities will require significant cash. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term
 investments equal to 2.5 billion. If we or our partners do not meet our goals to successfully commercialize our medicines, including our
 commercial medicines, or to license certain medicines and proprietary technologies, we will need additional funding in the future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors such as:

successful commercialization of our commercial medicines;

the profile and launch timing of our medicines in development;

changes in existing collaborative relationships and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements;

continued scientific progress in our research, drug discovery and development programs;

the size of our programs and progress with preclinical and clinical studies;

the time and costs involved in obtaining marketing authorizations;

competing technological and market developments, including the introduction by others of new therapies that address our markets; and

our manufacturing requirements and capacity to fulfill such requirements.

If we need additional funds, we may need to raise them through public or private financing. Additional financing may not be available on
 acceptable terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the shares of existing stockholders will be diluted and the price, as well as the price of our other securities, may decline. For example, in September 2024, we
 completed an underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock for total net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, of approximately 489.1 million. If adequate
 funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may have to cut back on one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, or commercial operations. Alternatively, we may obtain funds through arrangements with
 collaborative partners or others, which could require us to give up rights to certain of our technologies or medicines.

44 

Index 

We have incurred losses, and our business will suffer if we fail to consistently achieve profitability in the future.

Because drug discovery and development require substantial lead-time and money prior to commercialization, our expenses have generally
 exceeded our revenue since we were founded in January 1989. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 2.1 billion and stockholders equity of approximately 0.7
 billion. Most of our income has historically come from collaborative arrangements, including commercial revenue from royalties and R D revenue, with additional income from research grants and the sale or licensing of our patents, as well as
 interest income. We will now and continuing into the foreseeable future need to invest significant financial resources to develop capabilities to commercialize medicines on our own and expect that our income in the future will be driven primarily by
 commercial sales. If we do not earn substantial revenue from commercial sales, we may incur additional operating losses in the future, which could restrict our ability to successfully develop additional medicines or sustain future profitability.

We may not be entitled to obtain additional milestone payments under our royalty monetization agreement with Royalty Pharma.

In January 2023, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with Royalty Pharma Investments. In addition to the 500 million we received
 at closing, this agreement makes available to us up to an additional 625 million in milestone payments. However, these additional milestone payments are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions related to the regulatory approval or commercial
 sales of pelacarsen, in certain cases by specific deadlines. Should we not satisfy such conditions by the applicable deadlines, or if we fail to meet our obligations or default under this agreement, the actual amount of additional payments to us could
 be substantially less than the maximum amounts available thereunder.

Risks related to our intellectual property

If we cannot protect our patent rights or our other proprietary rights, others may compete more effectively against us.

Our success depends to a significant degree upon whether we can continue to develop, secure and maintain intellectual property rights to
 proprietary products and services. However, we may not receive issued patents on any of our pending patent applications in the U.S. or in other countries and we may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce our patents and other intellectual property
 rights, any of which could impact our ability to compete effectively. In addition, the scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, other parties may successfully challenge,
 invalidate or circumvent our issued patents or patents licensed to us so that our patent rights do not create an effective competitive barrier or revenue source.

We cannot be certain that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and courts in the U.S. or the patent offices and courts in
 foreign countries will consider the claims in our patents and applications covering our commercial medicines, or any of our medicines in development, as patentable. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type
 of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our
 targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent,
 even through legal action.

If we or any licensor partner loses or cannot obtain patent protection for our commercial medicines or any of our medicines in
 development, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.

Intellectual property litigation could be expensive and prevent us from pursuing our programs.

From time to time, we have to defend our intellectual property rights. If we are involved in an intellectual property dispute, we may need
 to litigate to defend our rights or assert them against others. Disputes can involve arbitration, litigation or proceedings declared by the U.S. PTO or the International Trade Commission or foreign patent authorities. Even if resolved in our favor,
 litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public
 announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

45 

Index 

If a third party claims that our medicines or technology infringe its patents or other intellectual property rights, we may have to
 discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease certain activities. We may not be able to obtain a license to needed intellectual property on favorable terms, if at all. There are many
 patents issued or applied for in the biotechnology industry, and we may not be aware of patents or patent applications held by others that relate to our business. This is especially true since patent applications in the U.S. are filed confidentially
 for the first 18 months. Moreover, the validity and breadth of biotechnology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal issues remain.

Risks related to product liability

We are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate
 in the future or at all.

Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of
 therapeutic products, including potential product liability claims related to our commercial medicines and our medicines in development. We have clinical study insurance coverage and commercial product liability insurance coverage. However, this
 insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims against us, or be available to us at an acceptable cost, if at all. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our medicines, injury
 to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical study volunteers and loss of revenues. Thus, whether or not we are insured, a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material.

Risks related to our personnel

The loss of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, could make it more difficult to run our
 business and reduce our likelihood of success.

We are dependent on the principal members of our management
 and scientific staff, and as we move towards commercializing medicines on our own, we will become increasingly dependent on the principal members of our commercial team. We do not have employment agreements with any of our employees that would
 prevent them from leaving us. The loss of our management, key scientific or commercial employees might slow the achievement of important research and development or commercial goals. It is also critical to our success that we recruit and retain
 qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work and that we recruit and retain qualified marketing, sales, market access, distribution, and related personnel to commercialize our medicines. We may not be able to attract and
 retain skilled and experienced personnel on acceptable terms because of intense competition for experienced personnel among many pharmaceutical and health care companies, universities and non-profit research institutions. In addition, failure to
 succeed in clinical studies or in commercializing our medicines may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel .

Risks related to health epidemics, climate change and other events

Our business may be adversely affected by health epidemics, climate change, extreme weather events, earthquakes, war, civil or political
 unrest, terrorism or other catastrophic events.

Our business could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we or our partners are commercializing our medicines, have
 concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers and contract research organizations upon whom we rely. For example, enrollment in some of our clinical trials
 was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In recent years, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns have become more common. As a result, we are potentially exposed to
 varying natural disaster or extreme weather risks such as hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, droughts, floods, or other events that may result from the impact of climate change on the environment. The potential impacts of climate change may also include
 increased operating costs associated with additional regulatory requirements and investments in reducing energy, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we currently manufacture most of our research and clinical supplies in a manufacturing
 facility located in Carlsbad, California. We manufacture the finished drug product for TEGSEDI, WAINUA and WAYLIVRA at third-party contract manufacturers. Biogen manufactures the finished drug product for SPINRAZA and QALSODY. The facilities and the
 equipment we, our partners and our contract manufacturers use to research, develop and manufacture our medicines would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace.

46 

Index 

Our facilities or those of our partners or contract manufacturers may be harmed by natural disasters or other events outside our control,
 such as earthquakes, war, civil or political unrest, deliberate acts of sabotage, terrorism or industrial accidents such as fire and explosion, whether due to human or equipment error, and if such facilities are affected by a disaster or other event,
 our development and commercialization efforts would be delayed. Although we possess property damage and business interruption insurance coverage, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be
 available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our development and commercialization activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown of the U.S. government, including the FDA.

Risks related to cybersecurity, social media and artificial intelligence

We are dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, which exposes us to data security risks.

We are dependent upon our own and third-party information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including mobile technologies, to
 operate our business. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems may make them vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, disruption of data integrity, malicious intrusion, or random attacks. Likewise, data privacy or security
 incidents or breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized
 persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, particularly as companies (including us) moved to more remote work structures during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the number
 and frequency of cybersecurity events globally may be heightened during times of geopolitical tension or instability between countries, including, for example, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and military conflicts in Israel and the
 surrounding areas, as well as related political or economic responses and counter-responses by various global actors, or collectively, conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service
 reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. A security breach or privacy violation that leads
 to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, delay progress on the development of our medicines, compel us to
 comply with federal and state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to financial penalties and mandatory and costly corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to
 litigation or other liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, any of which could disrupt our business and result in increased costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential
 information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have invested, and continue to invest, in the protection of our data and
 information technology infrastructure, our efforts may not prevent service interruptions or identify breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which
 could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us.

The increasing use of social media platforms and artificial intelligence based software presents new risks and challenges.

Social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our medicines and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. Social
 media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear and create uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. There is also a risk of
 inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on social media. We may also encounter criticism on social media regarding our company, management, or medicines. Our reputation could be damaged by
 negative publicity or if adverse information concerning us is posted on social media platforms or similar mediums, which we may not be able to reverse. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we
 could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.

Additionally, artificial intelligence, or AI, based software is increasingly being used in the biopharmaceutical industry. Use of AI based
 software may lead to the release of confidential proprietary information, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of our intellectual property.

Risks related to our securities and the global credit markets

If we do not progress in our programs as anticipated, the price of our securities could decrease.

For planning purposes, we estimate and may disclose the timing of a variety of clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as when we
 anticipate a certain medicine will enter clinical trials, when we anticipate completing a clinical study, or when we anticipate filing an application for, or obtaining, marketing authorization, or when we or our partners plan to commercially launch a
 medicine. We base our estimates on present facts and a variety of assumptions, many of which are outside of our control. If we do not achieve milestones in accordance with our or our investors or securities analysts expectations, including milestones
 related to our commercial medicines and medicines in development, the price of our securities could decrease.

If the price of our securities continues to be highly volatile, this could make it harder to liquidate your investment and could increase
 your risk of suffering a loss.

The market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of many other biopharmaceutical companies, has been and is likely to
 continue to be highly volatile. These fluctuations in our common stock price may significantly affect the trading price of our securities. During the 12 months preceding September 30, 2024, the closing market price of our common stock ranged from 53.55
 to 36.45 per share. Many factors can affect the market price of our securities, including, for example, fluctuations in our operating results,
 financing transactions, announcements of collaborations, clinical study results, technological innovations or new products being developed by us or our competitors, the commercial success of our approved medicines, governmental regulation, marketing
 authorizations, changes in payers reimbursement policies, developments in patent or other proprietary rights and public concern regarding the safety of our medicines.

Broad market factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. For example,
 recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and the failure of Silicon Valley Bank have caused disruptions of global financial markets and resulted in increased volatility in the trading
 price of our common stock. In addition, industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock. Nasdaq, and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations
 that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market
 for biotechnology or pharmaceutical stocks or the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to us, the opportunities in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical market or the stock market in general, could depress our stock price
 regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, convertible notes documents, call spread hedge transaction documents and Delaware
 law may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares.

Our certificate of incorporation provides for classified terms for the members of our board of directors. Our certificate also includes a
 provision that requires at least 66 2/3 percent of our voting stockholders to approve a merger or certain other business transactions with, or proposed by, any holder of 15 percent or more of our voting stock, except in cases where certain directors
 approve the transaction or certain minimum price criteria and other procedural requirements are met.

Our certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at a
 duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent. In addition, only our board of directors, chairperson of the board or chief executive officer can call special meetings of our stockholders. We have in the
 past, and may in the future, implement a stockholders rights plan, also called a poison pill, which could make it uneconomical for a third party to acquire our company on a hostile basis. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to fix
 the rights and preferences of, and issue shares of preferred stock, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company without action by our stockholders.

The provisions of our convertible senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the
 occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their notes or a portion of their notes, which may discourage certain types of
 transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market prices.

48 

Index 

In 2023, we completed a 575 million offering of 1.75 Notes and used 488.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 1.75 
 Notes to repurchase 504.4 million of our 0.125 Notes. In 2021, we completed a 632.5 million offering of 0 Notes and used 319.0 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 0 Notes to repurchase the remaining 309.9 million of our 1 
 Notes. In 2019, we entered into privately negotiated exchange and/or subscription agreements with certain new investors and certain holders of our existing 1 Notes to exchange 375.6 million of our 1 Notes for 439.3 million of our 0.125 Notes, and
 to issue 109.5 million of our 0.125 Notes. Additionally, in connection with the pricing of our 0 Notes and 0.125 Notes, we entered into call spread transactions in which we purchased note hedges and sold warrants. Terminating or unwinding the call
 spread transactions could require us to make substantial payments to the counterparties under those agreements or may increase our stock price. The costs or any increase in stock price that may arise from terminating or unwinding such agreements could
 make an acquisition of our company significantly more expensive to the purchaser.

These provisions, as well as Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and other of our agreements, may
 discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices, and may limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their
 best interests.

Future sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our securities.

Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in
 the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect trading prices of our securities. For example, we may issue approximately 28.2 million shares of our common stock upon conversion of our 1.75 Notes, 0 Notes
 and 0.125 Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 0 Notes and 0.125 Notes, we entered into certain call spread transactions covering 10.9 million shares and 6.6 million shares, respectively, that we expect will offset the dilution to holders of common stock upon any conversion of those notes. In addition, o f the shares reserved, 6.1 million shares are reserved for issuance upon conversion of 0.125 Notes that we have repurchased and are currently held by us in treasury (and thus would not be dilutive). As a result, to the extent we elect to
 convert the 0.125 Notes held by us in treasury, we expect we would receive up to 6.1 million shares upon settlement of related convertible note hedges (without any additional dilution caused by the conversion of the 0.125 Notes held in treasury). 
 However, the anti-dilutive effect of the convertible note hedges is offset by certain warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 0 Notes and the 0.125 Notes. The addition of any of these shares into the public
 market may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities. 

In addition, pursuant to the call spread transactions we entered into in connection with the pricing of our 0 Notes and 0.125 Notes, the
 counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time at or prior to the conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock, other of our securities, or other instruments, including
 over-the-counter derivative instruments, that they may wish to use in connection with such hedging, which may have a negative effect on the conversion value of those notes and an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock. The call spread
 transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion of our 0 Notes or 0.125 Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted
 0 Notes or 0.125 Notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.

Negative conditions in the global credit markets and financial services and other industries may adversely affect our business, financial
 condition or stock price.

The global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions recently, including as a result of the
 COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. These disruptions can result in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in
 economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. If the current equity
 and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect
 on our operations, growth plans, financial performance or stock price. In addition, our insurance carriers and insurance policies covering all aspects of our business may become financially unstable or may not be sufficient to cover any or all of our
 losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.

49 

Index 

A variety of risks associated with operating our business and
 marketing our medicines internationally could adversely affect our business. In addition to our U.S. operations, we are commercializing TEGSEDI in the EU, Canada, Latin America and certain Caribbean countries, and WAYLIVRA in the EU, Latin America
 and certain Caribbean countries. We face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, pricing and reimbursement, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. Because we have
 international operations, we are subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities, including :

compliance with differing or unexpected regulatory requirements for our medicines and foreign employees;

complexities associated with managing multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers or patient self-pay systems;

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

in certain circumstances, increased dependence on the commercialization efforts and regulatory compliance of third-party distributors or strategic partners;

foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;

U.S. and foreign government tariffs, trade and export restrictions, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;

anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and its equivalent in foreign jurisdictions;

economic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, political instability or public health issues or health epidemics, in particular
 foreign countries or globally;

fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations related to doing business in
 another country;

compliance with tax, employment, privacy, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;

workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.; and

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships.

Our business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules
 of other countries in which we operate, including the United Kingdom s Bribery Act 2010. In many other countries, the healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are
 government entities; therefore, any dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA. There is no certainty that all employees and third-party business partners (including our contract research organizations,
 contract manufacturing organizations, distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. Importantly, we do not control the actions of manufacturers and other third-party agents, although we may be
 liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial
 condition.

Risks related to compliance with laws

Our operations are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry.

Our operations are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, including federal and state
 anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, such as the federal Sunshine Act, and health information privacy and security laws, which are subject to change at any time. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our
 business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. Penalties for violations of applicable healthcare laws and regulations may include
 significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and additional reporting requirements and oversight
 if we enter into a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. In addition, violations may also result in reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings.

50 

Index 

Because we use biological materials, hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds, if we do not comply with laws regulating
 the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.

Our research, development and manufacturing activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as materials,
 chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We store most of these materials and various wastes resulting from their use at our facilities in Carlsbad, California pending ultimate
 use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause:

interruption of our research, development and manufacturing efforts;

injury to our employees and others;

environmental damage resulting in costly clean up; and

liabilities under federal, state and local laws and regulations governing health and human safety, as well as the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials
 and resultant waste products.

In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry
 insurance for pollution liability in amounts and types that we consider commercially reasonable, the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate. If our losses exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition would
 be adversely affected.

Our business is subject to changing regulations for corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the
 risk of noncompliance.

Each year we are required to evaluate our internal control systems to allow management to report on, and our Independent Registered Public
 Accounting Firm to attest to, our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, we continue to incur additional expenses and divert our management s time to comply with these regulations. In addition, if we cannot
 continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, or The Nasdaq Global
 Select Market. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.

The SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that
 require our compliance. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted, and in August 2022, the SEC adopted additional rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act related to say on pay and
 proxy access. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which has and may in the future lead
 to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business.

Risks related to taxes

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryovers and certain other tax attributes may be limited.

Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses,
 or NOLs, carried over from a prior taxable year. Under the Code, we can carry forward our NOLs to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire. The same is true of other unused tax attributes, such as tax credits.

Under the current U.S. federal income tax law, U.S. federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be
 carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such U.S. federal NOLs is limited to 80 percent of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to current U.S. federal income tax law, and there may be periods
 during which states suspend or otherwise limit the use of NOLs for state income tax purposes.

In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an ownership
 change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage-point cumulative change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax
 attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs
 and our ability to use our NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. As a result of our merger with Akcea Therapeutics, Inc. in
 2020, or the Akcea Merger, we are subject to the separate return limitation year, or SRLY, rules. Under the SRLY rules, our utilization of Akcea s pre-merger NOL and tax credit carryforwards is limited to the amount of income that Akcea contributes to
 our consolidated taxable income. The Akcea pre-merger tax attributes cannot be used to offset any of the income that Ionis contributes to our consolidated taxable income. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of
 NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.

51 

Index 

Our future taxable income could be impacted by changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties.

A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could materially affect us.

We could be subject to additional tax liabilities. 

We are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign
 income taxes, sales taxes in the U.S., withholding taxes and transaction taxes in foreign jurisdictions. In 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
 including Pillar Two Model Rules defining a global minimum tax rate of 15 on a country-by-country basis for multinational corporations with annual consolidated revenue above 750 million. The ultimate impact from changes in legislation of countries
 in which we operate remains uncertain and such changes could have a material impact on our future effective tax rate. In addition, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the
 ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax,
 accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than
 anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such
 jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical
 tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period for which a determination is made .
