("PSSI") was incorporated in the state of Utah as subsidiary controlled by the Company. The Company transferred to PSSI its exclusive world-wide license to the defense, detection and protection security products previously acquired by the Company. The Company owns 79.8 of PSSI with 20.2 acquired by several individuals and entities. The Company plans to continue the development of the technology. All sales and marketing activities are through PSSI. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations is highly uncertain and subject to change. We considered the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our estimates and assumptions and there was not a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended July 31, 2024. The Company s security products are licensed from CCS and developed by the company designed for personal and collateral protection. Products derived from this technology are intended to provide passive security scanning units for either walk-through or hand-held use to improve security for schools and other public facilities. Passive Portal units use electromagnets and do not emit anything (such as x-rays) through the subject. We have also completed a prototype with optional Digital Imaging, which will give the user of the scanner the ability to recall the entire traffic passing through the scanner at any time thereafter. As of May 19, 2020, the Company added an IR Camera for detection of elevated body temperatures and is presently offering these products: PASSIVE PORTAL Screens for Weapons only; PASSIVE PORTAL with EBT Screens for Weapons and elevated body temperature; EBT Station Screens for elevated body temperature only.

These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Although forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

Our operating expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2024 was 163,517 compared to 143,383 for the same period in 2023. The increase was due primarily to lower consulting costs, which were 120,000 offset by higher general and administrative costs of 22,117 for the three months periods ending July 31, 2024. The Company recorded zero depreciation and general and administrative costs of 43,178 for the three-month periods ended July 31, 2024 compared to general and administrative expense of 21,061 for the same periods in 2023. Interest expenses incurred in the three months periods ended July 31, 2024 was 7,058 compared to interest expense of 7,370 for the three-month periods in 2023. A loan origination fee of 10,000 and loss on notes of 295,000 was incurred during the same period. Change in derivative liability resulted in a gain of 8,166 for the three months period ended July 31, 2024, compared to a gain of 12,224 for the same period in 2023 We estimate the fair value of the derivative for the conversion feature of our convertible notes payable using the American Binominal Lattice pricing model at the inception of the debt, at the date of conversions to equity, cash payments and at reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount and a gain or loss on change in derivative liability as applicable. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective loan agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability will fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuation may be material. Total other income and expense for the three-month periods ended July 31, 2024 was other expense of 303,892 compared to other income of 4,854 for the same periods in 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At July 31, 2024 the Company had total current assets of 8,106 and total current liabilities of 2,132,877 resulting in a working capital deficit of 2,124,771.

We anticipate that in the short term, operating funds will continue to be provided by related parties and other lenders.

Net cash used in the three-month 2024 period consisted of net loss of 467,409, change in payables to related parties of 108,229, decrease in accounts payable of 110,595 and loss on notes of 295,000 and loan origination fee of 10,000. During the three months ended July 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 39,727 consisting of a note payable net of 40,000 and repayment of note to related party of 273. We have had no revenue and paid expenses and costs with proceeds from the issuance of securities as well as by loans from investor, stockholders and other related parties. 16 Table of Contents Our immediate goal is to provide funding for the completion of the production of the Offender Alert Passive Scan licensed from CCS. The Offender Alert Passive Scan is an advanced passive scanning system for detecting and identifying concealed threats. We have built 33 Passive Portal units, two of which were used in the previously announced BETA Test at a school near Austin Tx and 5 were sold in the previous fiscal year. The units have been tested multiple times and performed with a 100 success every time. We are confident that upon the successful conclusion of the Beta Test, we will receive the first orders from school districts that will generate initial revenues to the Company. We believe a related party and other lenders will provide sufficient funds to carry on general operations in the near term and fund DTC s production and sales. We expect to raise additional funds from the sale of securities, stockholder loans and convertible debt. However, we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain financing to carry out our business plan. See the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have either implemented or that may have a material future impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosures. We operate with a limited number of accounting and financial personnel. Although we retain the services of an experienced certified public accountant, we have been unable to implement proper segregation of duties over certain accounting and financial reporting processes, including timely and proper documentation of material transactions and agreements. We believe these control deficiencies represent material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Despite the material weaknesses in financial reporting noted above, we believe that our consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in all material respects. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 17 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
