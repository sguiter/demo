Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report may be forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements are contained principally in the sections entitled Risk Factors, and Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, but are also contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.
In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, might, will, 
 should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, would, 
 intends, targets, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, 
 predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

Failure
of future market acceptance of our mobile esports products and services; 

Increased
levels of competition; 

Changes
in political, economic or regulatory conditions generally and in the markets in which we operate; 

Our
ability to retain and attract senior management and other key employees; 

Our
ability to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and
prevent others from infringing on the proprietary rights of the Company; and 

Other
risks, including those described in the Risk Factors discussion. 

You should
carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition
or future results set forth under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed therein, except as
set in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of important factors that
may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking
statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions, and we may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations included
in our forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections
about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because
forward- looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should
not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking
statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. 

These forward-looking statements speak only as
of the date of this Quarterly Report. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have
no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should therefore not rely on these forward-looking
statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

MOBILE GLOBAL ESPORTS INC. 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For the Six months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited) 

under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company was originally named Elite Esports, Inc. but changed
its name to Mobile Global Esports Inc. on April 21, 2021. MOGO Inc has been assigned certain limited rights to commercialize university
esports events for 92 universities in India. The unique advantage of esports is that the events can be virtual, and virtual events bypass
any Covid-19 or other pandemic restrictions on in-person events. 

During July 2022, MOGO Esports Private Limited MOGO Pvt Ltd was established and incorporated in India by certain shareholders of MOGO Inc. During November 2022, MOGO Inc acquired approximately 
of MOGO Pvt Ltd. MOGO Pvt Ltd comprised approximately and of the Company s total assets as of June 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, and and of the Company s net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and and of the
Company s net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MOGO Inc and MOGO Pvt Ltd (collectively, the Company ). MOGO Inc
owns a controlling interest in MOGO Pvt Ltd. The value of the non-controlling interest in MOGO Pvt Ltd is immaterial. 

The functional currency of MOGO Pvt Ltd is the
Indian Rupee INR ). The assets and liabilities of MOGO Pvt Ltd are translated to United States Dollars USD at period end exchange rates, while statements of operations accounts are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. The
effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive loss, which is a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. 

Interim financial statements 

The unaudited condensed financial statements are
prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). The
information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management,
are necessary to fairly state the Company s financial position, the results of its operations, and cash flows for the periods presented.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The results of operations for
the six months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. 

Liquidity and Going Concern 

The Company s operations are subject to
certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the Company s need for additional financing, the ability to attract mobile
esports users and viewers to the Company s offerings, the challenges of establishing a business in India, and reliance on key members
of management. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis
that assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has a limited operating history, has incurred operating losses to date,
and expects to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company has had significant management turnover in
the past year, which could negatively impact the Company s ability to achieve its strategic direction. Furthermore, the Company
may be unable to generate significant revenue within the next year or generate sufficient cash flows to continue its operations. The Company
has a new Chief Executive Officer and is working with other consultants and its board of directors to operate the Company. Management
believes the current team has the necessary experience to achieve its goals. The Company had million of cash and an accumulated deficit
of million as of June 30, 2024 and million of cash and an accumulated deficit of million as of December 31, 2023. Management
believes that the Company s current cash on hand combined with the projected cash flows for the next 12 months will be sufficient
to continue the Company s operations for at least the 12 months. However, the failure of the Company to achieve its business objectives
could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and could require the Company to need additional equity
or debt financing to continue its operations. These conditions, among other factors, raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

with universities for the purpose of promoting, expanding and commercializing university sports programs, creating professional opportunities
for university athletes and alumni and developing and marketing university and event-branded merchandise. The SII esports business, which
has now been transferred to and is operated by MOGO, is the only business in India to organize and sponsor an officially-sanctioned national
championship for university esports. At June 30, 2024, SII holds a 12.5 minority common share interest in MOGO, and thus has no controlling
interest in MOGO. 

Esports are the competitive playing of video games
by amateur and professional teams for cash and other prizes. Esports typically take the form of organized, multiplayer video games that
include real-time strategy and competition, including virtual fights, first-person shooter and multiplayer online battle arena games.
Esports are defined as competitive games of skill, timing, knowledge, experience, practice, attention and teamwork, but not games of chance
or luck. Mobile esports are defined as esports that are streamed on an electronic esports platform and played by individuals or teams
on mobile devices, usually smartphones. Competitors participate at large in-person events, small in-person events and virtually from home
or computer cafes. Interest in esports is rapidly growing. In 2020, the global audience for gaming video content, including esports, grew
to 1.2 billion viewers, an 18 percent increase from 2019, according to Statista, as gaming streams became a popular social activity and
distraction during coronavirus-related lockdowns. A DataProt report in January 2023 placed the number of gamers at 1.7 billion. 

MOGO s esports business began in 2016 when
SII introduced esports to the Association of Indian Universities AIU ), an academic and sports body that represents 854
major universities. AIU sanctioned esports as a championship event in a unique and exclusive 10-year renewable agreement with SII. SII
has assigned most of its esports rights under these and other agreements involving esports to MOGO under a series of contracts between
the two companies. SII licensed to MOGO exclusive rights to develop, organize, promote and monetize mobile esports events in collaboration
with AIU and with a second major university sports association, Elite University Sports Alliance of India Pvt. Ltd. EUSAI ),
a for-profit subsidiary of SII. EUSAI itself has direct contracts with 92 leading Indian universities pursuant to which EUSAI is granted
exclusive rights to organize and monetize a range of sports, including esports. Although any AIU or EUSAI members may choose to not participate
in MOGO s esports business, the combination of AIU and EUSAI s member universities potentially gives MOGO access to students
attending these 854 Indian universities. 

13 

The first SII esports championship was held at
Lovely Professional University (LPU) in 2017, the second at Maharshi Dayanand University in 2018 and the third at SRM Institute of Science
and Technology in 2019. The 2020 championships were cancelled during the covid lockdowns. MOGO sponsored the 2021-2022 championships
at LPU in April 2022. During the period of May through December 2021, MOGO, with the help of SII and SII s subsidiaries pursuant
to their mutual contracts, organized and commercialized a total of 27 virtual esports tournaments in India. These events included inter-
and intra-university competitions that reached an aggregate audience of over 450,000 viewers (most of whom were added in the last quarter
of calendar year 2021, reflecting recent momentum in interest in university esports), according to SII s YouTube channel analytics.
During September 2023, MOGO produced the MOGO National Championship 2.0 event, which was held at Lovely Professional University LPU in Phagwara, India. The event featured competitive play from 16 teams representing four geographic regions within India. MOGO produced
the esports championship in cooperation with Elite Power Sports, which produced the national basketball, volleyball, and kabaddi university
championships. Team MOGO Esports also secured victories in two competitions, held on October 28, 2023 and November 8, 2023, featuring
teams from across India. 

Management expects commercialization of these
events will be similar to events in more developed esports markets, such as South Korea, China and the U.S. Revenue is expected to come
from sponsorships, advertising, subscriptions, tickets to future events, branded merchandise and fees. In addition, monetization of the
data collected through MOGO s game platform is expected to provide additional revenues. In the past events, the viewers data
was collected by third-party streaming services, such as YouTube and Facebook. Once the players and viewers are routed through MOGO s
proprietary game and social media platform, MOGO anticipates collecting the data (names, phone numbers, email addresses, university affiliation,
etc.), processing the data, combining the data with other commercially-available data sets and offering the data to the markets following
strict government privacy guidelines, particularly since a subset of our users will likely be underage first-year university students.
Management believes that the value of the data may become one of the dominant revenue elements in MOGO s business model.

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were approximately
 497,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared with 916,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in general
and administrative expenses was primarily driven by a decrease of approximately 143,000 in professional and consulting fees, 359,000
in compensation to U.S. personnel, 49,000 in travel, offset by an increase of 107,000 in expenses incurred by MOGO Pvt Ltd. 

General and administrative expenses were approximately
 1,114,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared with 1,732,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in general
and administrative expenses was primarily driven by a decrease of approximately 270,000 in professional, accounting, legal and consulting
fees, 418,000 in compensation to U.S. personnel, 74,000 in travel, offset by an increase of 139,000 in expenses incurred by MOGO Pvt
Ltd. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of June 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, we had cash of approximately 2,033,000 and 3,175,000, respectively. 

We have financed our
operations through the issuance of common stock and common stock with warrants. In July 2022, we issued 1,725,000 shares of common stock
for total gross proceeds of 6,900,000 through an initial public offering IPO ). We received net proceeds after commissions,
fees and expenses of approximately 5,465,000. In September 2022, we issued 1,886,793 shares of common stock along with 1,886,793 warrants,
for total gross proceeds of 5,000,001 through a private equity placement PIPE ). We received net proceeds after commissions,
fees and expenses of approximately 4,422,000. 

15 

Funding Requirements 

We believe we may need to raise additional funding
to meet our cash, operational and liquidity requirements for at least 12 months after the date of this quarterly report. 

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds to us from the IPO and the PIPE. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of
these proceeds. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from the IPO
and the PIPE for operating expenses, marketing, event expenses, streaming, retention of additional staff in the United States and India,
working capital and general corporate purposes, including perhaps acquisitions of game licenses, technology platform agreements, data
development and strategic partnerships. Investors are cautioned, however, that expenditures may vary substantially from these uses. Investors
will be relying on the judgment of our management, who will have broad discretion regarding the application of the proceeds of the IPO
and the PIPE. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the amount of cash generated
by our operations and the amount of competition we face and other operational factors. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions
of the proceeds from the IPO and the PIPE for other purposes. 

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties
associated with establishing a new business in India, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements.
Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

Failure
of future market acceptance of our mobile esports products and services; 

Increased
levels of competition; 

Changes
in political, economic or regulatory conditions generally and in the markets in which we operate; 

Our
ability to retain and attract senior management and other key employees; 

Our
ability to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and
prevent others from infringing on the proprietary rights of the Company; and 

Other
risks, including those described in the Risk Factors discussion. 

See Risk Factors for additional
risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities increased
by approximately 82,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily
due to a decrease in net loss of approximately 588,000 offset by a decrease in warrant expense of 46,000 and a change of 149,000 in
the accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in the change in other current assets of 480,000. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities decreased
by approximately 389,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was due
to a decrease in the amount of payments for property, equipment and software. 

Financing activities 

Net cash used in financing activities changed
by approximately 27,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with the six months ended June 30, 2023. The change was due to
a decrease in payments on the note payable for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

JOBS Act 

As an emerging growth company under
the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting
standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this
provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies
that are not emerging growth companies. 

Subject to certain conditions, as an emerging growth company, we rely
on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation: 

reduced
disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 

no
advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 

exemption
from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 

We may take advantage of these exemptions for
up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company
on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of 1.07
billion or more; (ii) the last day of 2027; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible
debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of
the SEC. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be
different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. 

17 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have during the periods presented,
and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of June 30, 2024, management has not completed
an effective assessment of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting based on the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
(COSO) framework. Management has concluded that, during the period covered by this quarterly report, our internal controls and procedures
were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of U.S. GAAP. Management identified the following material weaknesses set forth
below in our internal control over financial reporting. 

1. We lack the necessary corporate accounting
resources to maintain adequate segregation of duties. 

2. We did not perform an effective risk assessment
or monitor internal controls over financial reporting or our cyber security environment. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

18 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

We are not currently subject to any legal proceedings
or claims, however, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with the normal course of our business. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

RISK FACTORS 

You should carefully review and consider the information
regarding certain factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth under the heading
 Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have
been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed therein, except as set forth below; 

We will require additional financing in
order to implement and execute our business plan, and we cannot be certain that such additional financing will be available on reasonable
terms when required, or at all. 

As of June 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of
approximately 2,033,000. We believe we may need to raise additional funding to meet our cash, operational and liquidity requirements
to continue operating for at least 12 months after the date of this quarterly report. 

We currently do not have any contracts or commitments
for additional financing. Any future equity financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders. There can be no assurance
that such additional capital will be available on a timely basis, or on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms when needed, the Company may not be able to fund its business or its expansion, take advantage
of strategic acquisitions or investment opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. Such inability to obtain additional financing
when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition
and prospects. 

If we raise additional funds by issuing equity
or convertible debt securities, we will reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders, and the holders of those newly-issued
equity or convertible debt securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those possessed by our then-existing stockholders
and/or note holders. Additionally, future sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock or other equity-related securities
could depress the market price of our Common Stock in the public market, and could impair our current or future ability to raise capital
through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities or the sale of debt. We cannot predict the effect that future sales
of our Common Stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our Common Stock.
