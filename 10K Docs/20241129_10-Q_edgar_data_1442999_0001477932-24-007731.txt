LIQUIDITY GOING CONCERN On September 30, 2024, the Company has negative working capital of has incurred losses since inception of , and has not received revenues from sales of products or services. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The ability of Alterola to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company generating cash from the sale of its common stock and/or obtaining debt financing and attaining future profitable operations. Management s plans include selling its equity securities and obtaining debt financing to fund its capital requirement and ongoing operations; however, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts.

Overview Our goal is to provide better medicines for patients around the world. We believe in harnessing the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids and cannabinoid- like compounds, which can be developed into valuable treatments for seriously ill patients. Rather than just focusing on one method of identifying, researching and developing such medicines, we are interested in developing new medicines from all sources including botanical, traditional chemical synthesis and biosynthetic methodologies. On May 28, 2021, we acquired ABTI Pharma Limited, a company registered in England and Wales ABTI Pharma ), with the purchase of all of its capital stock in exchange for 600,000,000 shares of our common stock pro rata to the ABTI Pharma shareholders. As a result of the acquisition, we are a pharmaceutical company working with cannabinoid and cannabinoid-like molecules. We have three areas of focus: 1) Development of regulated pharmaceuticals (human and animal health) and regulated food products. This has been achieved via the strategic acquisition of Phytotherapeutix Ltd.; 2) Production of low cost of goods Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and food-grade ingredients (supported by the strategic acquisition of Ferven Ltd); and 3) Formulation, and drug delivery, providing improved bioavailability, solubility and stability (supported by the exclusive licensing of IP and technology from Nano4M Ltd). Phytotherapeutix Ltd, a subsidiary of ABTI Pharma Ltd, has generated a number of molecules with patents pending, some of which have demonstrable pharmacological activity, similar to that of CBD. This means that some of these molecules are anticipated to have a similar market potential to CBD across a range of therapeutic areas. Ferven Ltd, another subsidiary of ABTI Pharma Ltd, is looking to produce cannabinoids by fermentation. The exclusively licensed organism has the potential to be genetically modified to produce multiple cannabinoids at an anticipated very low cost of goods. It is anticipated that the selected genetically modified organisms will grow very quickly, which in turn, reduces the cost of production. Nano4M Ltd is a company which has exclusively licensed its nano-formulation patents and know-how to ABTI Pharma Ltd. As of April 18, 2023, we acquired intellectual property from Alinova Biosciences Ltd. We acquired Alinova s joint interest in the patent family of PTX 0001. We paid 35,000 Sterling in cash and 5,000,000 shares of ABTI Stock. In November 2021, we acquired assets and IP from C2 Wellness Corporation. The consideration paid was 24,000,000 ABTI shares. On September 08, 2023, we agreed to sell the same assets and IP to C2 Wellness Corporation for a total of 29,015,993 of our shares On April 16, 2024, the Company formed a new subsidiary Phytanix Bio, with 1,000 Common shares and 17,000 Preferred Shares originally being authorized as founding shares.

Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 We have generated no revenues since inception and we do not anticipate earning revenue until such time that we are able to market and sell our ingredients and / or products / medicines. We incurred operating expenses of 477,231 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 123,157 for the same period ended 2023. Our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were mainly the result of 234,342 in consulting fees, 91,548 in accounting and audit fees, legal fees of 96,060, and general and administrative expenses of 24,023. By contrast, our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were mainly the result of 15,937 in consulting fees, 25,000 in directors fees, 23,162 in accounting and audit fees and 33,519 in salaries and wages. Additionally, we incurred operating expenses of 1,160,053 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 716,724 for the same period ended 2023. The increases are primarily a result of increased accounting and audit fees, research development, consulting fees and an increase in general and administrative increase due to a proposed transaction previously announced between Chain Bridge and the Company. If we are able to obtain financing, we expect that our operational expenses will increase significantly for the balance of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 and beyond. This would be the result of increased research and development expenses associated with our product candidates, the development of those candidates in compliance with regulatory processes, laws and regulations, increased payroll as we take on more help, as well as the expenses associated with our reporting obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We had other expnses of 321,962 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of a gain on conversion, compared with zero in other income for the same period ended September 30, 2023. We recorded a net loss of 799,193 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 123,157 for the same period ended 2023. As a relatively recently formed pharmaceutical company, the company has limited operations to date, and expects to have reoccurring losses, as is typical with companies in the pharmaceutical industry, for the foreseeable future. As explained above, the company intends to raise capital and ramp up its efforts to bring its product candidates to market. This will require significant capital, product development to continue and complete and momentum on those product candidates through the regulatory process. There are no assurances that we will be able to generate revenues and achieve profitable operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,147,024 in current assets, consisting mostly of cash in bank of 82,720, loans receivable of 1,063,235 and inventories, and current liabilities of 3,615,314. We had a working capital deficit of 2,468,290 as of September 30, 2024, compared with a working capital deficit of 1,329,601 as of March 31, 2024. We had cash used in operating activities of 1,067,729 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 197,625 for the same period ended 2023. Our negative operating cash flow the six months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly the result our net loss of 1,453,940, adjustment for the add back of non-cash expenses related to stock issued for services aggregating 306,635, and changes in operating assets and liabilities such as a decrease in accounts payable of 19,902 and increase in accrued liabilities of 99,538. Our negative operating cash flow during the six months ended September 30, 2023 was mainly the result of a net loss offset by shares issued for services and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. There was cash used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 of 60,000 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of 35,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used in investing for 2024 was for patents and associated intellectual property and the cash provided by investing for 2023 was related to the acquisition of patent production rights. Financing activities provided 1,322,869 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of related party notes and advances of 49,014 and net proceeds from notes payable of 2,493,935, offset by cash used in financing activities of 157,045 related to the payment of deferred offering costs and an issuance of a loan receivable of 1,063,235. Financing activities provided 75,530 for the six months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of related party notes offset by the receipt of treasury shares and purchase of common shares for cash. Based upon our current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next 12 months. We intend to fund operations through short-term or long-term debt and/or equity financing arrangements, however this may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Going Concern Our financial statements were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have negative working capital of 2,468,290 as of September 30, 2024, and have incurred losses since inception of 13,673,734. We expect to incur further losses in the development of our business and have been dependent on funding operations from inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans include continuing to finance operations through the private or public placement of debt and/or equity securities and the reduction of expenditures. However, no assurance can be given at this time as to whether we will be able to achieve these objectives. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 5 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. Remediation Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our company plans to take steps to enhance and improve the design of internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending March 31, 2025: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 6 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
