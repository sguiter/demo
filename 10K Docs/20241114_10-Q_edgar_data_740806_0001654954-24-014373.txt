Loans million at September 30, 2024 and was reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using methods that approximate a level yield without anticipating prepayments. The accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due and is not well collateralized and in the process of collection, or when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the principal or interest will not be collectible in the normal course of business. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. A loan is considered to be past due when a scheduled payment has not been received 30 days after the contractual due date. All accrued interest is reversed against interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest received on such loans is accounted for using the cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, there is a sustained period of repayment performance, and future payments are reasonably assured.

The allowance for credit losses on loans ACLL on troubled loan modifications is measured using the same method as other loans held for investment. The Company evaluates all loan modifications according to the accounting guidance for loan refinancing and restructuring to determine whether the modification should be accounted for as a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan. If the modification meets the criteria to be accounted for as a new loan, any deferred fees and costs remaining prior to the modification are recognized in income and any new deferred fees and costs are recorded on the loan as part of the modification. If the modification does not meet the criteria to be accounted for as a new loan, any new deferred fees and costs resulting from the modification are added to the existing amortized cost basis of the loan. The following tables present the amortized cost of loans and leases to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by class of financing receivable, type of modification, financial effect of the modification, and percentage of the amortized cost basis of modifications as compared to the amortized cost basis of each loan segment for the periods presented (dollars in thousands). There were no loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any unfunded commitments on loans modified and designated as troubled loan modifications. Collateral Dependent Disclosures The collateral method is applied to individually evaluated loans for which foreclosure is probable. The collateral method is also applied to individually evaluated loans when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. Collateral dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. These loans do not share common risk characteristics and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining the allowance for credit losses. Under CECL, for collateral dependent loans, the Company has adopted the practical expedient to measure the allowance for credit losses based on the fair value of collateral. The allowance for credit losses is calculated on an individual loan basis based on the shortfall between the fair value of the loan's collateral, which is adjusted for liquidation costs/discounts, and amortized cost. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost, no allowance is required. The following table presents an analysis of collateral-dependent loans of the Company as of the periods noted (dollars in thousands): Owner-occupied commercial real estate Commercial and industrial Total loans Other construction, land development and land Secured by farmland Owner-occupied commercial real estate Commercial and industrial Total loans 19 Table of Contents Other construction, land development and land Secured by farmland Home equity open end Real estate Home Equity closed end Multifamily Owner-occupied commercial real estate Other commercial real estate Agricultural loans Commercial and industrial Credit Cards Automobile loans Other consumer loans Municipal loans Gross loans Less: Unamortized net deferred loan fees Net loans held for investment Other construction, land development and land Secured by farmland Home equity open end Real estate Home Equity closed end Multifamily Owner-occupied commercial real estate Other commercial real estate Agricultural loans Commercial and industrial Credit Cards Automobile loans Other consumer loans Municipal loans Gross loans Less: Unamortized net deferred loan fees Net loans held for investment Credit Quality Indicators The Company presents loan and lease portfolio segments and classes by credit quality indicator and vintage year.

The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding study derived from internal information, and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing the allowance for credit losses on loans and are discussed above. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments of thousand at September 30, 2024 and thousand at December 31, 2023 is separately classified on the consolidated balance sheet within Other liabilities. 26 Table of Contents Adjustment to allowance for unfunded commitments for adoption of ASU 2016-13 Recovery of credit losses unfunded commitments Balance as of September 30 Right-of-use assets Weighted average remaining lease term (years) years Weighted average discount rate Total lease cost Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities A maturity analysis of operating lease liabilities and reconciliation of the undiscounted cash flows to the total of operating lease liabilities is as follows (dollars in thousands): Twelve months ending December 31, 2025 Twelve months ending December 31, 2026 Twelve months ending December 31, 2027 Twelve months ending December 31, 2028 Thereafter Total undiscounted cash flows Discount Lease liabilities 27 Table of Contents Purchase of foreclosed real estate Loans transferred to OREO Proceeds from sale of OREO Gain on sales of OREO Balance as of September 30 The Company did not have any other real estate owned at September 30, 2024 or 2023. million and million in FHLB advances, respectively. fixed to floating rate subordinated note due with an aggregate principal amount of million. , or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 593 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears.

The Company s portfolio of LHFS is classified as Level 2. Interest Rate Lock Commitments and Forward Sales Commitments IRLCs The Company, through F M Mortgage, enters into commitments to originate residential mortgage loans in which the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding, termed interest rate lock commitments IRLCs ). Such rate lock commitments on mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market are derivatives. Upon entering into a commitment to originate a loan, the Company protects itself from changes in interest rates during the period prior to sale by requiring a firm purchase agreement from a permanent investor before a loan can be closed (forward sales commitment). The Company locks in the loan and rate with an investor and commits to deliver the loan if settlement occurs on a best-efforts basis, thus limiting interest rate risk. Certain additional risks exist if the investor fails to meet its purchase obligation; however, based on historical performance and the size and nature of the investors, the Company does not expect them to fail to meet their obligation. The Company determines the fair value of the IRLCs based on the price of the underlying loans obtained from an investor for loans that will be delivered on a best-efforts basis while taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close. 28 Table of Contents thousand, with a notional amount of million and total positions of .

S. Treasury securities U.S. Government sponsored enterprises Securities issued by States and political subdivisions of the US Mortgage-backed obligations of federal agencies Corporate debt securities IRLC Assets at Fair Value Liabilities: Forward sales commitments Liabilities at Fair Value Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the financial statements: Collateral Dependent Loans with an ACL - In accordance with ASC 326, we may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate it from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry, among other things. A loan is collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. We reevaluate the fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans on a quarterly basis. The fair value of real estate collateral supporting collateral dependent loans is evaluated by appraisal services using a methodology that is consistent with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. Other Real Estate Owned - Certain assets such as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured at fair value less cost to sell. Valuation of other real estate owned is determined using current appraisals from independent parties, a level two input. If current appraisals cannot be obtained prior to reporting dates, or if declines in value are identified after a recent appraisal is received, appraisal values are discounted, resulting in Level 3 estimates. If the Company markets the property with a realtor, estimated selling costs reduce the fair value, resulting in a valuation based on Level 3 inputs. The Company had no OREO at September 30, 2024 and OREO with a carrying value of 55 thousand at December 31, 2023. The Company markets OREO independently and with local realtors. Properties marketed by realtors are discounted by selling costs. Properties that the Company markets independently are not discounted by selling costs. The following presents the carrying amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands). Fair values are estimated under the exit price notion in accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. 31 Table of Contents Owner-occupied commercial real estate Total collateral dependent loans with an ACL OREO - - Owner-occupied commercial real estate Commercial and industrial Total collateral dependent loans with an ACL OREO The following table presents information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): Discounted appraised value Discount for marketability and selling costs Owner-occupied commercial real estate Discounted appraised value Discount for marketability and selling costs Discounted appraised value Discount for marketability and selling costs Owner-occupied commercial real estate Discounted appraised value Discount for marketability and selling costs Commercial and industrial Discounted appraised value Discount for marketability and selling costs OREO Discounted appraised value Discount for marketability and selling costs 32 Table of Contents Securities Loans held for sale Loans held for investment, net Interest receivable Bank owned life insurance IRLC Forward sales commitments Liabilities: Deposits Short-term debt Long-term debt Interest payable Securities Loans held for sale Loans held for investment, net Interest receivable Bank owned life insurance IRLC Liabilities: Deposits Short-term debt Long-term debt Interest payable Forward sales commitments Interest cost Expected return on plan assets Recognized net actuarial gain Net periodic pension cost 33 Table of Contents shares with a fair value of thousand from the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan to selected employees.

Return on average assets was 0.24 and return on average equity was 3.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Both ratios are lower than those reported for the second quarter 2024. The decline in net income is attributed primarily to a provision for credit losses of 902,000 compared to a recovery of 458,000 recorded in the second quarter which combined to increase provision expense by 1.4 million. In addition, we recorded 930,000 in one-time expenses, consisting of 193,000 in severance expense for a former bank officer and a 737,000 expense related to an external fraud event. The after-tax impact of these two events on net income lowered third quarter net income by 735,000 as compared to the second quarter. Noninterest income declined 238,000 from the previous quarter due to lower income from investment services, insurance and mortgage banking. Non-interest expenses increased by 1.5 million due to the previously mentioned one-time items and higher employee benefits expenses which included 577,000 in pension distribution gains in the second quarter. Net interest income before the provision for credit losses increased by 294,000 on a linked quarter basis. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 226,000 or 0.06 per share from the 1.0 million or 0.29 per share reported for same quarter in 2023. Return on average assets declined by 0.08 and return on average equity decreased by 2.10 . These results reflect an increase of 513,000 in net interest income, an increase of 282,000 in the provision for credit losses, an increase of 241,000 in noninterest income and an increase of 764,000 in noninterest expenses due to the severance and fraud loss expenses recorded in the third quarter 2024. For third quarter 2024, net interest income totaled 8.5 million, an increase of 294,000 from second quarter 2024, as a 570,000 increase in interest income outpaced a 276,000 increase in interest expense. Net interest margin for the quarter ending September 30, 2024 was 2.77 , up five basis points from the quarter ending June 30, 2024. Higher loan balances and repricing of adjustable-rate loans contributed to a 339,000 increase in loan interest income. Higher balances in federal funds sold and interest bearing overnight cash balances increased interest income on cash and securities. The earning asset yield increased by ten basis points to 5.29 . Cost of funds increased by three basis points to 2.54 . Total interest expense increased by 276,000, a combination of a 489,000 increase in interest expense on deposits and a 213,000 decrease in interest expense on short-term debt. The increase in interest expense on deposits resulted from growth in time deposit balances. This was partially offset by the decrease in interest expense on short-term debt as Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances declined from 20.0 million on June 30, 2024, to 15.0 million on September 30, 2024. Compared to third quarter 2023, net interest margin increased by seven basis points due to growth in the average balances of loans, federal funds sold and overnight cash. Loans as a percentage of earning assets increased to 68 in third quarter 2024 from 66 in third quarter 2023. Interest income increased 1.7 million, and the earning asset yield increased by 37 basis points. Interest expense grew by 1.2 million, and the cost of funds increased by 33 basis points as growth in both the average balances of and rates paid on time deposits was partially offset by a decline in FHLB advances. During third quarter 2024, the Bank recorded a 902,000 provision for credit losses compared to a 458,000 recovery of credit losses in second quarter 2024 and a 620,000 provision in third quarter 2023. The current quarter provision was the result of a 7.4 million increase in the balances of pooled loans used in the Bank s Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans ACLL model and net charge-offs of 657,000. There were no significant changes in the qualitative factors used in the ACLL model during the quarter; the reserve on one individually reviewed loan increased 20,000. By comparison, the second quarter recovery was due to the release of 608,000 in reserves related to the improvement in the collateral value of an individually evaluated loan relationship, net loan charge-offs totaling 179,000, slower loan growth, and an improvement in the experience, depth and ability of lending management qualitative factor. In third quarter 2023, the provision was driven by net charge-offs of 193,000 and growth of 29.3 million in gross loans. Noninterest income, which includes gains and losses, totaled 2.7 million for third quarter 2024, a decrease of 238,000 from second quarter 2024. Investment services and insurance income declined by 148,000, mortgage banking income declined by 91,000 and income from ATM and check card fees decreased by 28,000. Service charges on deposits increased by 25,000. The other categories of noninterest income combined to increase noninterest income by 4,000. Compared to third quarter 2023, noninterest income increased 241,000 from 2.5 million. The increase resulted from increases of 61,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, 105,000 in investment services and insurance income, and 139,000 in mortgage banking income. Other operating income declined by 89,000. Smaller year-over-year changes in other categories combined to increase noninterest income by 25,000. Noninterest expenses totaled 9.7 million for third quarter 2024, compared to 8.2 million for second quarter 2024, an increase of 1.5 million. During the third quarter, we recorded 930,000 in one-time expenses, consisting of 193,000 in severance expense for a former bank officer and a 737,000 expense related to an external fraud event. During second quarter 2024, the Bank recognized 577,000 in gains from lump sum pension distributions, which lowered employee benefits expense by 547,000. Salaries expense increased by 211,000 due to the severance expense for a former bank officer. Employee benefits expense increased by 659,000 due to the pension related gains in the second quarter. Other operating expenses increased by 687,000, driven by the fraud loss. ATM and check card expenses increased by 73,000, telecommunication and data processing expenses increased by 60,000 and marketing expenses were 35,000 higher than in the prior quarter. There were decreases of 170,000 in legal and professional fees and 33,000 in equipment expenses. Other changes in noninterest expense categories combined to decrease total noninterest expenses by 21,000. 36 Table of Contents Compared to the same quarter in 2023, noninterest expenses increased 763,000 from 8.9 million. Salary expense was 154,000 lower than last year as 193,000 in severance offset a portion of the cost savings derived from the voluntary early retirement program implemented in fourth quarter 2023. Other operating expenses increased 635,000, due to the previously mentioned fraud loss. There were also increases of 103,000 in employee benefits expense, 182,000 in telecommunications and data processing expense, 43,000 in occupancy expenses, 28,000 in equipment expenses, 32,000 in FDIC insurance assessment expense and 66,000 in bank franchise tax expense. There were decreases of 68,000 in advertising expenses, 24,000 in legal and professional fees, 53,000 in ATM and check card fees, and 27,000 in director fees expense. Year-to-Date Income Statement Discussion Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.0 million or 1.44 per share, compared to 2.3 million or 0.67 per share for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.7 million or 0.77 per share. Year-to-date return on average assets was 0.51 and return on average equity was 8.37 . Both ratios are higher than those reported for the same period of 2023. The improvement in net income is attributed primarily to lower noninterest expenses, which declined by 2.0 million to 26.3 million. Net interest income and noninterest income also improved by 1.2 million and 470,000, respectively. The year-to-date provision for credit losses increased from 1.2 million in 2023 to 1.3 million in 2024. Year-to-date net interest income totaled 24.8 million, an increase of 1.2 million from 2023, as a 6.4 million increase in interest income outpaced a 5.1 million increase in interest expense. Net interest margin was 2.74 , up two basis points from the 2.72 reported for 2023. Higher loan balances and repricing of adjustable-rate loans contributed to a 5.8 million increase in loan interest income, which represented most of the increase in interest income and increased the earning asset yield by fifty-one basis points to 5.24 . Cost of funds increased by fifty basis points to 2.51 . Total interest expense increased by 5.1 million, due to growth in both the average balances of and rates paid on time deposits. During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank recorded a 1.3 million provision for credit losses compared to a 1.2 million provision in the same period in 2023. The provision for 2024 was the result of 8.6 million in loan growth and 1.6 million in net charge-offs, which were partially offset by the release of 608,000 in reserves related to improvement in the collateral value of a 2.8 million individually evaluated loan relationship that no longer requires an allowance for credit losses. There were no significant changes in the reserves on individually analyzed loans; there was improvement in the experience, depth and ability of lending management qualitative factor in in second quarter of 2024. Year-to-date noninterest income, which includes gains and losses, totaled 8.1 million in 2024, an increase of 470,000 from the same period in 2023. Several categories of noninterest income increased on a year-over-year basis. Service charges on deposit accounts increased by 126,000, investment services and insurance income increased by 449,000, mortgage banking income increased by 231,000, title insurance income increased by 138,000, ATM and check card fees increased by 43,000 and low-income partnership losses decreased by 27,000. Income on bank owned life insurance declined by 425,000 due to the gains received in 2023 on a death benefit and other operating income decreased by 119,000. Noninterest expenses totaled 26.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 28.3 million for the same period of 2023, a decrease of 2.0 million. Salary expense declined by 1.9 million due to cost savings associated with a voluntary early retirement program implemented in fourth quarter of 2023 and lower severance expenses. Employee benefits expense declined by 815,000 due to a combination of the voluntary early retirement program, 577,000 in gains from lump sum pension distributions, and a refund of 162,000 received in March 2024 due to better than projected group health insurance claims in 2023. There were declines of 299,000 in advertising expenses, 133,000 in ATM and check card fees, and 90,000 in directors fees. There were increases of 491,000 in other operating expenses, 233,000 in FDIC insurance expense, 175,000 in occupancy expenses, 146,000 in telecommunications and data processing expenses, and 130,000 in bank franchise tax expense. There were other changes in noninterest expense categories that combined to increase total noninterest expenses by 38,000. 37 Table of Contents Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin For the first nine months of 2024, tax-equivalent net interest income 1 was 24.9 million, an increase of 1.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. This resulted in a slight increase in the net interest margin, from 2.72 to 2.74 . Tax-equivalent interest income and fees on loans rose by 5.9 million, driven by higher rates on variable-rate loans and a 58.5 million increase in the average balance of loans and loans held for sale. Tax-equivalent interest income from federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, and securities increased by 503,000, reflecting higher interest rates and increased average balances in federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with other banks. The earning asset yield for the first nine months of 2024 was 5.24 , compared to 4.73 for the same period in 2023. Interest expense rose by 5.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 to 22.8 million, primarily due to higher market interest rates and an increase in the average balance of time deposits by 127.7 million. This growth in time deposits shifted the deposit mix away from noninterest-bearing demand and lower-cost deposits. Consequently, the cost of funds increased to 2.51 for the period, compared to 2.01 in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, tax-equivalent net interest income totaled 8.5 million, an increase of 525,000 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin for the three months ended September 30 was 2.77 in 2024, up from 2.69 in 2023. Tax-equivalent interest income for the quarter reached 16.3 million, up from 14.6 million in the same quarter last year. This increase was driven by an additional 1.4 million in tax-equivalent interest and fee income on loans, resulting from a 39.3 million rise in average balances of loans and loans held for sale. Tax-equivalent interest income from interest-bearing deposits with other banks and securities rose by 329,000, as average balances of fed funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with other banks increased by 33.0 million, while the average balance of securities declined by 25.1 million due to bond maturities and mortgage-backed securities paydowns. This shift in the earning asset mix, along with higher market interest rates, contributed to an earning asset yield of 5.29 for the current quarter, compared to 4.92 for the same quarter in the prior year. Total interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 7.8 million, an increase of 1.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense on time deposits, which rose by 2.2 million. In contrast, interest expense on interest-bearing demand, savings, and money market accounts declined by 519,000. This shift reflects both higher rates paid on time deposits and a reallocation of funding from lower-costing deposits to time deposits. Additionally, interest expense on borrowings declined by 460,00 due to paydowns of 5.0 million in FHLB debt during the quarter. Comparing the two quarters, the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits declined by 4.4 million, while the average balance of time deposits increased by 129.8 million. This shift contributed to an increase in the cost of funds, rising to 2.54 in the third quarter of 2024, up from 2.21 in the same quarter of 2023. _________________ 1 Tax equivalent net interest income is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Total loans increased by 8.6 million to 830.7 million, including increases of 13.8 million in other construction and land development loans, 1.7 million in loans secured by farmland, 1.6 million in 1-4 family revolving loans, 9.3 million in residential mortgage loans, 2.7 million in multifamily loans, 2.6 million in loans to farmers, and 12.9 million in commercial and industrial loans. These increases were offset by decreases of 3.8 million in residential construction loans, 17.5 million in commercial real estate loans, 12.0 million in automobile loans, 2.2 million in other consumer loans, and 0.5 million in municipal loans. Investment securities increased by 7.5 million due to purchases of 18.0 million, combined with amortization, paydowns on U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities and expected bond maturities of 21.9 million, and a decrease of 11.4 million in unrealized loss on the bond portfolio. On September 30, 2024, the unrealized loss was 29.0 million compared to 40.2 million on December 31, 2023. Total deposits on September 30, 2024, were 1.22 billion, an increase of 85.1 million from the end of 2023, due to growth of 78.5 million in interest bearing deposits, specifically time deposits, and an increase of 6.5 million in noninterest bearing deposits. Shareholders equity increased by 11.7 million to 90.0 million due to net income of 5.0 million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 9.0 million, 206,000 in shares issued, and 131,000 in stock-based compensation expense. These increases were offset by the 2.7 million in dividends paid to shareholders. Securities Available for Sale AFS The Company s available-for-sale (AFS) securities portfolio is reported at fair value, based on market prices of comparable instruments. This portfolio mainly includes U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency and mortgage-backed securities issued by federal agencies, as well as municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, the total AFS securities were 376.2 million, up from 368.7 million on December 31, 2023. 40 Table of Contents This represents an increase of 7.5 million, or 2.0 . The average balance of the AFS securities portfolio during the first nine months of 2024 was 358.9 million, compared to 386.7 million during the same period in 2023. The average AFS securities portfolio accounted for 29.5 and 33.1 of average earning assets as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease in AFS securities is primarily due to maturities and expected paydowns on mortgage-backed securities in the bond portfolio. Net unrealized losses related to the fair value of AFS securities were 28.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 40.2 million as of December 31, 2023. This unrealized loss is attributed to rising market interest rates rather than credit quality. During the period, 22.0 million in mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds matured or were paid down, of which 18.0 million was reinvested in higher-yielding bonds. Scheduled maturities and paydowns are expected to total 70.7 million in the last quarter of 2024 and 59.3 million in 2025. The portfolio s weighted average life is 4.24 years, with a modified duration of 3.41 years. Loan Portfolio The Company operates in a diverse local economy supported by various industries, including agribusiness, manufacturing, services, and several universities and colleges. The Bank is an active lender for residential mortgages and residential construction and typically provides commercial loans to small and mid-size businesses and farms within its primary service area. Additionally, the Bank offers automobile and recreational vehicle loans through its Dealer Finance division. Loans Held for Investment totaled 830.7 million at September 30, 2024 and increased 8.6 million from 822.1 million at December 31, 2023. As a percentage of average earning assets, average loans were 67.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 65.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Loans Held for Sale totaled 2.3 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.2 million from 1.1 million on December 31, 2023. This category consists of F M Mortgage loans, which are affected by interest rate changes, seasonal trends, and refinancing activity. All mortgage loans held for sale have been precommitted to investors, effectively minimizing interest rate risk. The Company s loans held for investment portfolio is well-diversified, with first-lien, amortizing residential mortgage loans as the largest segment, representing 25.04 of total loans. Commercial real estate loans, including both owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied properties, comprise 181.1 million, or 21.8 of the portfolio. Automobile loans, originated through the Company s dealer finance division, total 111.0 million, accounting for 13.36 of the portfolio. Following is a breakdown of the loan portfolio composition as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Loan Segment Balance Percentage of Portfolio Balance Percentage of Portfolio 1-4 Family residential construction 26,649 3.21 30,488 3.71 Other construction, land development and land 61,568 7.41 47,749 5.80 Secured by farmland 83,326 10.02 81,657 9.92 Home equity open end 47,396 5.70 45,749 5.56 Real estate 208,199 25.04 200,629 24.38 Home Equity closed end 6,532 0.79 4,835 0.59 Multifamily 10,942 1.32 8,203 1.00 Owner-occupied commercial real estate 82,577 9.93 92,362 11.23 Other commercial real estate 98,527 11.85 106,181 12.91 Agricultural loans 16,994 2.04 14,405 1.75 Commercial and industrial 57,257 6.89 44,329 5.39 Credit Cards 3,270 0.39 3,252 0.40 Automobile loans 110,952 13.35 122,924 14.94 Other consumer loans 12,153 1.46 14,376 1.75 Municipal loans 5,059 0.61 5,625 0.68 Gross loans 831,401 100.00 822,764 100.00 Unamortized deferred net loan fees (684 (672 Loans held for sale 830,717 822,092 41 Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses represents the expense charged to current earnings to support the allowance for credit losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses is based on various factors that reflect management s assessment of the risk within the loan portfolio. These factors include historical loss data, both internal and from peer institutions; forecasted economic conditions and trends; collateral adequacy and value; portfolio volume and composition; portfolio performance; and the Company s and Bank s internal loan processes. The reserve for unfunded commitments is based on the likelihood that these commitments will be utilized. Management has implemented a comprehensive analytical process to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. This process and its guidelines are informed by federal banking regulatory guidance, along with relevant information from both internal and external sources, which consider past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience forms the basis for estimating expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss data are made to account for variations in current loan-specific risk factors, such as underwriting standards, portfolio composition, loan concentrations, credit quality, and loan term, as well as changes in environmental factors like unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant conditions. For more details on these forecasts, see the Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans" section in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of this process, combined with findings from the Bank s external loan review of inherent risks in the loan portfolio, support management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance at the balance sheet date. For an overview of the methodology management uses to assess the allowance adequacy on a quarterly basis and the provisions charged to expense, see the Critical Accounting Policies section above and Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, refer to the table Allowance for Credit Losses in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which details activity in the allowance for credit losses. The current quarter provision for credit losses of 902,000 was a combination of 869,000 provision for the allowance for loan credit losses, plus 33,000 provision for the allowance for unfunded commitments. The current quarter provision of 869,000 was driven by net loan charge-offs of 657,000, loan growth, and a 20,000 increase in the reserve for an individually reviewed loan. There were no significant changes in the environmental factors. As of September 30, 2024, year-to-date net charge-offs totaled 1.6 million, up from 703,000 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. Gross loans increased by 4.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 and by 7.5 million since December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) was 8.0 million, or 0.97 of gross loans outstanding, compared to 8.3 million, or 1.01 of gross loans outstanding, as of December 31, 2023. The reserve for unfunded commitments decreased from 690,000 at December 31, 2023, to 608,000 at September 30, 2024, due to decreases in loan commitments of 12.1 million in commercial and industrial loans and 1.4 million in 1-4 family construction, which were offset by an increase of 3.1 million in commitments for farmland and 2.2 million in owner-occupied commercial real estate. Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans that are 90 days or more past due. Nonaccrual loans are those on which interest accruals have been suspended or permanently discontinued. As of September 30, 2024, nonperforming loans totaled 6.6 million, compared to 6.5 million on December 31, 2023. At year-end 2023, nonperforming loans included a large relationship secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate and equipment, totaling 3.6 million. This balance was reduced to 2.1 million by September 30, 2024, through the liquidation of equipment held as collateral, and did not require an allowance for credit losses as of that date. Additionally, smaller loans totaling 4.4 million were nonperforming as of September 30, 2024. The nonaccrual loan coverage ratio decreased to 122.06 from 129.25 . For more details on nonperforming loans by segment, see Loans and Credit Quality in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 Table of Contents A summary of credit ratios for nonaccrual loans is as follows (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Allowance for credit losses 8,028 8,321 Nonaccrual loans 6,577 6,438 Nonperforming loans 6,578 6,469 Nonperforming assets 6,578 6,524 Total loans 830,717 822,092 Allowance for credit losses to total loans 0.97 1.01 Nonaccrual loans to total loans 0.79 0.78 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 122.06 129.25 Deposits and Other Borrowings The Company's main source of funding consists of deposits received from individuals, governmental entities and businesses located within the Company's service area. Deposit accounts include demand deposits, savings, money market, and certificates of deposit. Total deposits were 1.22 billion and 1.13 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Noninterest bearing deposits increased 6.5 million while interest bearing deposits increased 78.5 million. Total deposits increased 85.0 million from the end of 2023, as the Bank was able to attract deposits by offering competitive rates on time deposits. The Bank participates in the ICS (Insured Cash Sweep) programs and CDARS (Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service). These programs, ICS for demand and savings and CDARS for certificates of deposit, allow the Bank to accept customer deposits in excess of FDIC limits and through reciprocal agreements with other network participating banks by offering FDIC insurance up to as much as 50 million in deposits. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the bank held 97.5 million and 95.5 million in ICS accounts, respectively. The Bank did not hold any customer deposits in CDARS on September 30, 2024, and 258,000 in CDARS accounts on December 31, 2023. On September 30, 2024, 10.98 of the Company s total deposits were uninsured deposits. Short-term borrowings The Company utilizes short-term debt, including Federal funds purchased and FHLB short-term borrowings, to maintain liquidity. Federal funds purchased are unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions. FHLB short-term debt, secured by the Company s loan portfolio, may take the form of a daily rate variable loan, which acts as a line of credit, or a fixed rate advance, depending on the Company s needs. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had 15.0 million and 60.0 million of FHLB advances, respectively. Long-term borrowings On July 29, 2020, the Company sold and issued to an institutional accredited investor a 6.00 fixed to floating rate subordinated note due July 31, 2030 with an aggregate principal amount of 7.0 million. The note initially bears interest at 6.00 per annum, beginning July 29, 2020 but excluding July 31, 2025, payable semi-annually in arrears. From and including July 31, 2025 through July 30, 2030, or up to an early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 593 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. Beginning on July 31, 2025 through maturity, the note may be redeemed, at the Company s option, on any scheduled interest payment date. The note will mature on July 31, 2030. The subordinated note, net of issuance costs totaled 6.97 million and 6.93 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Capital Banking regulators have established a uniform system to assess capital adequacy for financial institutions, setting minimum capital requirements based on risk-adjusted assets. Failure to meet these minimum requirements can trigger mandatory and possibly additional discretionary regulatory actions, which could materially impact the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must adhere to specific capital guidelines that incorporate quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off balance-sheet items, as determined under regulatory accounting practices. Additionally, the Bank s capital amounts and classification are subject to regulators qualitative assessments regarding components, risk weightings, and other factors. 43 Table of Contents Under the Basel III rules, the Company must maintain a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios, set at 2.50 . As of September 30, 2024, the Company s capital conservation buffer was 5.23 , compared to 4.58 on December 31, 2023. This buffer is intended to enhance an institution s financial resilience across economic cycles. Financial institutions are required to maintain this minimum buffer under Basel III final rules to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain other payments. At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded the minimum common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total capital ratio, inclusive of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer, of 7.00 , 8.50 , and 10.50 , respectively, and the Bank qualified as well capitalized for purposes of the federal bank regulatory prompt corrective action regulations. The Bank s common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital ratios were both 12.28 , its total capital ratio was 13.23 ; the leverage ratio was 8.20 . Liquidity Liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet current and future financial obligations by either selling or maturing assets or obtaining additional funds through liability management. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, money market investments, federal funds sold, loans held for sale, and securities and loans maturing or repricing within one year. The Company also has access to additional liquidity sources, such as borrowing capacity through federal funds lines with several correspondent banks, a line of credit with the FHLB, credit availability at the Federal Reserve Bank, the ability to purchase brokered certificates of deposit, a corporate line of credit with a large correspondent bank, and options for debt and capital issuances. Management believes the Company s current liquidity position is sufficient to meet depositor requirements and support customers credit needs. The Company s on-balance sheet asset liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents, unpledged investment securities, and loans held for sale, which totaled 228.3 million at September 30, 2024, up from 178.0 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank had securities with a market value of 210.6 million and 215.6 million pledged to Federal Reserve Bank s credit programs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The bank has not utilized these credit programs in 2024 or 2023. The Bank has access to off-balance sheet liquidity through unsecured Federal funds lines totaling 90.0 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The Bank has a secured line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) with available credit of 150.8 million as of September 30, 2024, and 90.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The FHLB line of credit is secured by a blanket lien on qualifying loans in the residential, commercial, agricultural real estate, and home equity portfolios. The Bank is scheduled to receive 70.7 million from bond paydowns and maturities by the end of 2024 which can be used to fund future loan growth and for other purposes. The Bank has a Funding and Liquidity Risk Management policy that limits the amount of short-term and long-term alternative funding to no more than 25 of total assets. Market Risk Management Market risk refers to the sensitivity of a financial institution s earnings or the economic value of its capital to unfavorable changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. For the Company, the primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates affect the interest income earned on assets and the interest expense paid on liabilities. Rapid changes in short-term interest rates can introduce volatility in net interest income, particularly when there are imbalances in the maturity or repricing schedules of interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets, thereby increasing interest rate risk. The Company manages interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee ALCO composed of members of its Board of Directors and executive management. The ALCO is responsible for monitoring and managing the Company s interest rate risk and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk. The Company s Board of Directors reviews and approves the guidelines established by ALCO. 44 Table of Contents Management uses a simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. The model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but it provides an additional analysis of the sensitivity of the earnings to changes in interest rates to static gap analysis. Assumptions used in the model rates are derived from historical trends, peer analysis, and management s outlook, and include loans and deposit growth rates and projected yields and rates. All maturities, calls, and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments. Mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning. Different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates. Interest rates on different assets and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and is reflected in different rate scenarios. The following table represents interest rate sensitivity on the Company s net interest income using different rate scenarios: Change in Prime Rate Change in Net Interest Income +400 basis points -4.39 + 300 basis points -3.29 + 200 basis points -2.16 + 100 basis points -1.05 - 100 basis points 0.43 - 200 basis points 0.50 - 300 basis points -1.11 - 400 basis points -3.94 Market value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. Market values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net market value is the market value of all assets minus the market value of all liabilities. The change in net market value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term repricing risk in the balance sheet. The same assumptions are used in the market value simulation as in the earnings simulation. The following table reflects the change in net market value over different rate environments (dollars in thousands): Change in Prime Rate Change in Net Economic Value + 400 basis points -15.32 + 300 basis points -11.32 + 200 basis points -7.21 + 100 basis points -3.78 - 100 basis points 1.22 - 200 basis points -0.12 - 300 basis points -5.55 - 400 basis points -5.93 Prudent balance sheet management requires processes that monitor and protect the Company against unanticipated or significant changes in the level of market interest rates. Net interest income stability should be maintained in changing rate environments by ensuring that interest rate risk is kept to an acceptable level. The ability to reprice our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities over various time intervals is of critical importance. The Company uses a variety of traditional and on-balance-sheet tools to manage our interest rate risk. Gap analysis, which monitors the gap between interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, is one such tool. In addition, we use simulation modeling to forecast future balance sheet and income statement behavior. By studying the effects on net interest income of rising, stable, and falling interest rate scenarios, the Company can position itself to take advantage of anticipated interest rate movement, and protect us from unanticipated rate movements, by understanding the dynamic nature of our balance sheet components. An asset-sensitive balance sheet structure implies that assets, such as loans and securities, will reprice faster than liabilities; consequently, net interest income should be positively affected in an increasing interest rate environment. Conversely, a liability-sensitive balance sheet structure implies that liabilities, such as deposits, will reprice faster than assets; consequently, net interest income should be positively affected in a decreasing interest rate environment. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 104.0 million in assets repricing than liabilities subject to repricing in one year. This is a one-day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not required Item 4. Controls and Procedures The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 45 Table of Contents Part II Other Information Item 1.
