the right to utilize specific intellectual property ("IP") related to wood panel manufacturing within China. The IP is owned
by Mr. Li JiYong, who is also a director of the Company; and the Licensor, Shenzhen Junfeng Wood Chain Net Technology is owned by Mr.
Li. 

The fair value of the intellectual property has
been determined to be RMB 15.35 million. This valuation was derived from revenues associated with wood panel manufacturing activities,
utilizing key assumptions such as the non-renewal of the current licensing agreement and the application of the average net margin of
the Building Products sector in a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model, as well as the revenue figures provided by management for
Kuber Resources (Guangdong) Co. Ltd. The Company recognized a total of as a capital contribution for the intellectual property.

of 16.5 for corporations in Hong Kong, effective from the year of assessment 2018/2019. Before that, the applicable tax rate was
16.5 for corporations in Hong Kong. The Company did not make any provisions for Hong Kong
profit tax as there were no assessable profits derived from or earned in Hong Kong since inception. Additionally, payments of dividends
by the subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong to the Company are not subject to any Hong Kong withholding tax. 

PRC

As of September 30, 2024, three

c) Unissued VAT invoices 

The products that are sold by the Company in PRC
are subject to value-added tax VAT at a rate of 6 of the gross sales price or at a rate approved by the Chinese local
government. This VAT may be offset by VAT paid on purchase of raw materials included in the cost of producing the finished goods sold. 

Due to the rules imposed by local authorities
on newly established companies, which limited the issuance of VAT invoices per month. Consequently, the Company was not able to issue
VAT invoices for all its sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had issued VAT invoices for total sales of
 214,155 for its sales, leaving of sales VAT invoices unissued as of September 30, 2024. The Company has submitted a request
to increase the allowable VAT invoice amounts and is currently awaiting approval. Upon receiving approval, the unissued VAT invoices will
be issued. 

The local authority may require the Company to
rectify the issue above by demanding payments and submitting the relevant filings within a specified time period. If the Company fails
to do so within the specified time period, the local authority may impose a monetary fine on it and may also apply to the local people s
court for enforcement. 

If the Company receives any notice from the local
authority, the Company will be required respond to the notice and pay all amounts due to the government, including any administrative
penalties that may be imposed, which would require the Company to divert its financial resources which may impact its resources, if any,
to make such payments. Additionally, any administrative costs in excess of the payments, if material, may impact the Company's operating
results. 

As of today, the Company has not received any
notice from the local housing authority or any claim from our current and former employees. 

d) Restriction on cash disbursement on bank account 

As a newly established business, the Company experienced restrictions
imposed by the bank on new bank accounts by limiting its deposits and disbursements. In order to avoid disruption to the business operations,
the Company has engaged a related party, Shenzhen Guangfeng High Performance Wood Products Technology Co., Ltd. formerly Shenzhen Junfeng
Wood Chain Network Technology Co., Ltd., to collect sales revenues on behalf of the Company. These funds are then deposited or transferred
to the Company's bank account on a regular basis, ensuring the continued liquidity necessary for operational activities. 

The Company had an outstanding receivable of from the related
party as a result of this arrangement as of September 30, 2024. These receivables represent funds collected on behalf of the Company but
not yet remitted to its bank account. 

Management continuously evaluates the impact of these restrictions
on the Company's cash management and operational efficiency. Despite the challenges posed by the restriction on cash disbursement, the
Company remains committed to ensuring the uninterrupted conduct of its business activities. 

It is important to note that the amounts receivable
from the related party are subject to periodic reconciliation and may fluctuate over time based on sales activities and remittance schedules.

If there is any disagreement on the valuation, a third-party appraisal will be obtained, and the parties will negotiate
in good faith to reach an agreeable valuation. 

There are no material relationships between the
Company and Gongfa or their affiliates, except that Li Jiyong, a director of the Company, is a shareholder of Gongfa, and the Shareholders
of Gongfa are expected to become shareholders of Storming Dragon Limited, the Company s majority shareholder, controlled by the
Company s CEO, Raymond Fu, through an anticipated Exchange Agreement. 

The execution of the Acquisition Agreement represents
a non-recognized subsequent event, as the transaction s closing and share issuance are contingent upon the completion of the valuation
report and other closing conditions. Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to the Company s financial statements as of September
30, 2024, for the potential impact of this acquisition. 

Cancellation of the Series B Preferred Stock

into a Stock Cancellation Agreement with Chuang Fu Qu Kuai Lian Technology (Shenzhen) Limited Chuang Fu ), for the cancellation
of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Series B Preferred Stock which were issued
to Chuang Fu in 2018, in exchange for . The cancellation of the Series B Preferred Stock will enable the Company to have a more desirable
capital stock structure. Upon the cancellation of the Series B Preferred Stock the Company will have zero shares of Series B Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding.

Liquidity and capital resources 

Currently, we are relying on sales of our products.
Currently, we pay costs associated with running a business on a day-to-day basis . 

As of September 30, 2024, we had current assets
of 4,816,356 as compared to 3,473,299 as of December 31, 2023. We have cash of 103,653 and 102,493 as of September 30, 2024 and December

To the extent that our capital resources are insufficient
to meet current or planned operating requirements, we will seek additional funds through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other
arrangements with corporate partners, licensees or others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of diluting the holdings
of existing shareholders. The Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing and we do
not anticipate that existing shareholders will provide any portion of our future financing requirements. 

No assurance can be given that additional financing
will be available when needed or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate funds are not available,
we may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of its programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize.
This would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Disclosure
Controls and Internal Controls 

Our management, including our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the control. 

The design of any system of controls is also based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting subsequent to September 30, 2024, which were identified in connection with our management s evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
