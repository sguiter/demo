On July 7, 2023, the Company sold the full over-allotment shares at the IPO price of per share, resulting in the issuance of shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of million. After deducting offering expenses of million, the Company received an additional million in net cash proceeds. 

Note 2. 
 million. The Company s operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible notes. The Company s net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million. The Company expects to incur significant expenses to complete development of its product candidates. The Company may never be able to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of any of its product candidates in the United States or internationally and there can be no assurance that the Company will generate revenues or ever achieve profitability. The Company does not expect to receive significant product revenue in the near term. The Company, therefore, expects to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of September 30, 2024. Until such time the Company can generate substantial product revenue, the Company plans to finance its operations through a combination of equity offerings and convertible debt financings. The Company does not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that the Company can raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of the existing Company stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of the common stockholders. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, the Company may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its research and product development. 
 Based on the cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash into the first quarter of 2025 for its projected current operations. As a result, the Company believes there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and financing needs, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Such statements should be read together with the Risk Factors sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the 2023 Annual Report, which discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements . 
 
 Overview 
 Intensity Therapeutics, Inc. is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company passionately committed to applying scientific leadership in the field of localized cancer reduction leading to anti-cancer immune activation. Our new approach involves the direct injection into tumors of a unique product created from our DfuseRx SM discovery platform. 
 Intratumoral IT treatment, or treatment designed to contain a drug inside a tumor without spreading to the rest of the body, has been an objective of clinicians since discovery of chemotherapeutic agents. The challenge with IT treatment approaches is that a tumor s lipophilic, high fat, dense and pressurized microenvironment is incompatible with and does not absorb water-based products. We believe that this drug delivery challenge limits the effectiveness of prior and current IT treatments, which involve injecting aqueous drugs into a tumor without sufficient consideration of the tumor environment (regardless of the drug s mechanism or approach, i.e. the stimulation of an inflammatory response or efforts to attract immune cells into a hostile live tumor). Accordingly, there remains a continued unmet need for the development of direct IT therapies for solid tumors that provide high local killing efficacy coupled with nontoxic systemic anti-cancer effects. We believe we have created a product candidate with the necessary chemistry to overcome this local delivery challenge and achieve tumor killing with systemic immune activation and T-cell repertoire expansion in certain cancers. 
 Our platform has enabled us to create patented anti-cancer product candidates comprising active anti-cancer agents and amphiphilic molecules. Amphiphilic molecules have two distinct components: one part is soluble in water and the other is soluble in fat or oils. When an amphiphilic compound is mixed with therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapies, the agents also become soluble in both fat and water. Our product candidates include novel formulations consisting of potent anti-cancer drugs mixed together with these amphiphilic agents. 
 Our lead product candidate, INT230-6, is primarily comprised of three components: (i) cisplatin, a proven anti-cancer cytotoxic agent, (ii) vinblastine sulfate, also a proven anti-cancer cytotoxic agent, and (iii) an amphiphilic molecule SHAO ), which enables the two cytotoxic agents to disperse through a tumor and diffuse into cancer cells following a direct intratumoral injection. These three components are mixed and combined into one vial at a fixed ratio. Cisplatin and vinblastine sulfate are both generic and available to purchase in bulk supply commercially. The United States Food Drug Administration FDA has approved both drugs as intravenous agents for several types of cancers. Cisplatin was first approved in 1978 for testicular cancer, and is also approved in ovarian and bladder cancer. The drug is also used widely in several other cancers including pancreatic and bile duct cancer. Vinblastine sulfate was first approved in 1965 and is also approved in generalized Hodgkin s disease, lymphocytic lymphoma, advanced carcinoma of the testis, and certain types of sarcoma. The drug is also used in breast and lung cancer. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 In September 2024, we received authorization from the Swiss Medic and the Swiss Ethics Commission to initiate the INVINCIBLE-4 Study in Switzerland, a Phase 2 randomized open-label, multicenter study, to analyze the clinical activity, safety, and tolerability of INT230-6 given before administration of the standard of care SOC treatment in patients with early-stage, operable triple-negative breast cancer TNBC and SOC alone . 
 In October 2024, we dosed the first patient in the INVINCIBLE-4 Study. The primary endpoint is the pathological complete response pCR rate in the primary tumor and affected lymph nodes. The INVINCIBLE-4 Study is expected to enroll approximately 54 patients in Switzerland and France. 
 
 Our Clinical Programs 
 In July 2024, we dosed the first patients in the U.S. in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized study, or the INVINCIBLE-3 Study, testing INT230-6 as monotherapy compared to the SOC drugs in second and third line treatment

In the third quarter of 2024, we also received authorization from Health Canada and The European Medicines Agency to initiate the INVINCIBLE-3 Study in Canada and Europe, respectively. We plan to enroll 333 patients and initiate sites in eight countries in the INVINCIBLE-3 Study, and are in contract negotiations to approve and activate additional sites, which we estimate could take several months per site. The primary endpoint in the INVINCIBLE-3 Study is overall survival. 
 In 2017, we initiated a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study, IT-01, using INT230-6 in the United States under an investigational new drug application authorized by the FDA and in Canada under a preclinical trial application approved by Health Canada. Study IT-01 tested the safety and efficacy of INT230-6 in patients with refractory or metastatic cancers, and enrolled 110 patients in three arms: (i) INT230-6 used as a monotherapy, (ii) INT230-6 in combination with Merck s Keytruda (pembrolizumab), and (iii) INT230-6 in combination with BMS Yervoy (ipilimumab). We completed enrollment of IT-01 in June 2022, locked the IT-01 database in February 2023 and finalized the clinical study report in September 2023. We delivered the combination-specific reports and other information to our partners in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 In 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 randomized study that tested INT230-6 as a monotherapy treatment in early-stage breast cancer for patients not suitable for presurgical chemotherapy, or the INVINCIBLE-2 Study. The study enrolled 91 subjects and the database was locked in November 2023. The key endpoint was whether INT230-6 could reduce a patient s cancer compared to no treatment (the current SOC) or a saline injection. Substantial reduction of cancer presurgically in aggressive forms of cancer has been shown to correlate with delaying disease recurrence. Other endpoints of the INVINCIBLE-2 Study were to understand the percentage of necrosis that can be achieved in tumors for a given dose, especially tumors larger than two centimeters in longest diameter, and whether either a local or whole body anti-cancer immune response could be induced. The INVINCIBLE-2 Study demonstrated a high order of necrosis in presurgical breast cancer tumors in the period from diagnosis to surgery, with some patients experiencing greater than 95 necrosis of the tumor. Data from the INVINCIBLE-2 Study demonstrated that INT230-6 had a favorable safety profile. An increase of certain types of immune cells (CD4+ and NK T-cells) in the tumor and blood was also shown. There was also an increase in the T-cells repertoire relative to control. In July 2024, we finalized the clinical study report for the INVINCIBLE-2 Study. 
 We have also successfully developed Phase 3 quality analytical methods for the three INT230-6 components and successfully manufactured a large-scale batch of INT230-6. In a meeting with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, we agreed on a chemical manufacture and control CMC plan for Phase 3 and product registration for our three key ingredients and INT230-6. If we successfully execute the agreed upon plan, the CMC portion of a New Drug Application NDA should be acceptable to the FDA for product approval and registration (subject to final NDA review). In the first quarter of 2024, a portion of the batch was successfully delivered to our depot vendor, who will supply INT230-6 for the INVINCIBLE-3 and INVINCIBLE-4 studies. 
 Since our inception in 2012, our operations have included business planning, hiring personnel, raising capital, building our intellectual property portfolio, and performing research and development on our product candidates. We have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur net losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through approximately 54.5 million in cash received from the net proceeds of sales of our common stock, preferred stock and convertible notes. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We incurred net losses of 13.1 million and 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 63.6 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years. 
 We expect our expenses to increase as we continue to: 
 Fund our clinical studies in sarcoma and breast cancer; 
 Incur manufacturing costs for additional Good Manufacturing Practice GMP batches of our product candidates and enhancer molecules; 
 Seek regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 
 Hire additional personnel; 
 Expand our operational, financial, and management systems; 
 Invest in measures to protect our existing and new intellectual property; and 
 Establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize.

 Our ability to ultimately generate revenue to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the development, approval, and subsequent commercialization of our product candidates. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. 
 As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financing, or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may not be able to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we would have to significantly delay, reduce, or eliminate the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and we do not expect any revenue from the sale of product in the foreseeable future. We have not generated any revenue from licensing of our technology or product candidates yet either. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, then we may generate revenue in the future from product sales or licensing. We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization, licensing or sale of any of our product candidates. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Research and development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.8 million or 59 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and were primarily due to the following: 
 Salaries and benefits related costs increased 0.4 million due to the hiring of research employees in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024. 
 Clinical trial expenses increased 0.7 million due to the initiation of the INVINCIBLE-03 Study, which was partially offset by lower costs in our completed IT-01 and INVINCIBLE-02 studies. 
 Contract manufacturing expenses decreased as there were no manufacturing batches in process during the third quarter of 2024. 
 18 

Table of Contents 

General and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.3 million or 25 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and were primarily due to the following: 
 Salaries and benefits related costs increased by 0.2 million due to salary and bonus accrual increases and the hiring of a new chief financial officer in the fourth quarter of 2023, along with 0.1 million in higher stock-based compensation expense due to option and stock grants in 2024. 
 Insurance expense decreased by 0.1 million due to favorable renewal for directors and officers insurance premiums. 
 Interest income in 2024 related to interest earned on cash and investment balances from our IPO in June 2023. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.5 million or 186 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and were primarily due to the following: 
 Salaries and benefits related costs increased 0.9 million due to the hiring of research employees in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024, along with 0.3 million in higher stock-based compensation expense. 
 Clinical trial expenses increased 4.0 million due to the initiation of the INVINCIBLE-03 Study, which was partially offset by lower costs in our completed IT-01 and INVINCIBLE-02 studies. 
 Contract manufacturing expenses increased entirely due to costs for manufacturing a new batch of INT230-6 in the first half of 2024. 
 
 General and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.9 million or 145 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and were primarily due to the following: 
 Salaries and benefits related costs increased by 0.7 million due to salary and bonus increases and the hiring of a new chief financial officer in the fourth quarter of 2023, along with 0.9 million in higher stock-based compensation expense due to option grants in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Insurance expense increased by 0.4 million due to the additional directors and officers insurance obtained in connection with our IPO, net of a decrease in premiums due to favorable renewal terms beginning in July 2024. 
 Legal, audit and consulting fees, and other expenses increased as we completed our IPO in mid-2023 and transitioned operations as a publicly traded company. 
 Interest income in 2024 related to interest earned on higher cash and investment balances from our IPO in June 2023. In 2023, interest expense was related to interest expense on convertible notes outstanding, which converted to common stock at the time of our IPO, upon which we recognized a 2.3 million loss on debt conversion. In addition, at the time of our IPO, a preferred stock deemed dividend of 1.3 million was recognized, representing the value that was transferred to the Series B and C preferred stockholders upon triggering of anti-dilution provisions. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses from operations and negative cash flows that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase significantly, including in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, developing our manufacturing capabilities and building and qualifying our manufacturing facility to support clinical trials and commercialization and providing general and administrative support for our operations, including the cost associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, scale back or discontinue the development of our product candidates.

 On July 3, 2024, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on July 11, 2024, on which we registered for sale up to 150 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine, which includes up to 15 million of common stock that we may issue and sell from time to time, through H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright acting as our sales agent, pursuant to the sales agreement that we entered into with Wainwright on July 3, 2024 for our at-the-market equity program (the ATM Agreement ). Since inception, we have issued 51,820 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement for net proceeds of 0.2 million. 
 We have financed our operations primarily through an initial investment from our founder, the issuance and sale of convertible notes, private equity financings, and the IPO, after which shares of our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol INTS on June 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately 2.8 million. Based on our balances in cash and cash equivalents, we project to have sufficient cash to fund our current operating plan into the first quarter of 2025. 
 The following table summarizes the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and financing activities for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (12,552) (6,259) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 6,354 (8,844) Net cash provided by financing activities 424 20,485 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (5,774) 5,382 
 Operating Activities 
 Our cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.6 million, comprising of (i) our net loss of 13.1 million, as adjusted for 2.3 million in non-cash expenses (primarily for non-cash stock based compensation of 2.2 million), and (ii) net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 1.7 million. 
 
 Our cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 6.3 million, comprising of (i) our net loss of 7.4 million, as adjusted for 3.5 million in non-cash expenses (primarily for non-cash stock based compensation of 1.0 million and the loss on debt extinguishment of 2.3 million), and (ii) net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2.4 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.4 million and was due to the redemption of marketable debt securities of 9.4 million, partially offset by the purchase of marketable debt securities of 3.1 million. 
 
 Our cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 8.8 million and was comprised entirely of purchases of marketable debt securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to 0.3 million in proceeds received from the exercise of options and warrants, and 0.2 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock. 
 Our cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to 22.4 million of gross proceeds from the IPO (including the sale of the overallotment shares), less issuance costs of 2.2 million. In addition, we received 0.2 million from the sale of convertible notes and 0.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Our business experiences limited seasonality. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical accounting estimates are those policies which are both important to the presentation of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For a further discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see our 2023 Annual Report. No significant changes to our accounting policies took place during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company , we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired controls. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation over the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures defined above. Based upon that evaluation, we have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the material weaknesses identified in internal controls due to (i) a lack of segregation of duties due to limited administrative staff, (ii) limited reconciliation and review procedures over clinical contract accruals as we have rapidly expanded into new, late-stage clinical studies, and (iii) information technology matters regarding user access that aggregate to a material weakness. 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 Remediation Activities 
 In response to the above identified weakness, we have taken or continue to take the following remediation measures: 
 We are reassessing our accounting procedures and, as part of the financial reporting process, plan to implement the use of supplementary checks and additional reviews and evaluations of transactions to improve the accuracy and reliability of our financial information. 
 We are adding appropriate resources to ensure that such procedures are implemented and adequate reviews are performed. 
 In December 2023, we hired a new Chief Financial Officer with extensive public-company reporting and technical accounting experience to provide additional financial reporting oversight and review. 
 We have engaged additional technical accounting consultants to provide additional resources for the preparation and review of our quarterly close procedures. 
 We will evaluate new accounting software systems to improve system controls, and have already implemented a new financial reporting and filing software platform to leverage system-controls and streamline quarterly SEC filings controls. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer are active participants in these ongoing remediation processes and such processes are subject to audit committee oversight. We believe these steps will improve the effectiveness of our internal controls. While we are taking the above steps to remediate these weaknesses, we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully remediate them, which could impair our ability to accurately and timely meet our public company reporting requirements. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with us have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls. For these reasons, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are made aware of legal allegations arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any actions, claims, suits or other legal proceedings the outcome of which, if determined adversely to Intensity, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. Our risk factors have not changed materially from those described in "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 On June 29, 2023, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-260565) was declared effective in connection with our IPO, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 3,900,000 shares of common stock to The Benchmark Company, LLC, as representative of the underwriters (the Representative ), at a public offering price of 5.00 per share for total gross proceeds of 19.5 million. On July 10, 2023, we sold an additional 585,000 shares of common stock to the Representative in connection with its exercise in full of its over-allotment option at a public offering price of 5.00 per share for additional gross proceeds of 2.9 million. The net proceeds from our IPO have thus far been used primarily to (i) initiate and conduct studies related to our therapeutic treatments, (ii) conduct clinical trials and operations, (iii) develop our product candidates, and (iv) fund our working capital and general corporate activities. 
 In September 2024, the Company issued 11,750 restricted shares of its common stock (the Restricted Stock to a consultant as compensation for its services to the Company through the end October 2024. Such issuance was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act.
