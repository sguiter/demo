INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 (the Form 10-Q and other documents filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC contain, and future oral or written statements or press releases by us may contain, forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Generally, the words expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, will, estimates, could, may, and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying words. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this Form 10-Q or other materials regarding our financial position, financial performance, liquidity, strategic alternatives, market outlook, future capital needs, capital allocation plans, business strategies and other plans and objectives of our management for future operations and activities are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by our management based on their experience and prevailing circumstances on the date such statements are made. Such forward-looking statements, and the assumptions on which they are based, are inherently speculative and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: 
 
 the difficulty to predict our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources; 

restrictive covenants in the Credit Facility (as defined within) could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests; 

the conditions in the oil and gas industry; 

U.S. and global market and economic conditions, including impacts relating to inflation, interest rates and supply chain disruptions; 

the effects of public health threats, pandemics and epidemics, and the adverse impact thereof on our growth, operating costs, supply chain, labor availability, logistical capabilities, customer demand and industry demand generally, margins, utilization, cash position, taxes, the price of our securities, and our ability to access capital markets; 

the ability of the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC+ to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls; 

operating hazards or other risks, including the significant possibility of accidents resulting in personal injury or death, or property damage or other claims or events for which we may have limited or no insurance coverage or indemnification rights; 

the possibility of not being fully indemnified against losses incurred due to catastrophic events; 

cost and availability of insurance; 

claims, litigation or other proceedings that require cash payments or could impair financial condition; 

credit risk associated with our customer base; 

the effect of regulatory programs and environmental matters on our operations or prospects; 

the impact that unfavorable or unusual weather conditions could have on our operations; 

the potential inability to retain key employees and skilled workers; 

political, legal, economic and other uncertainties (such as the war in Ukraine and conflict in Israel and broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and eastern Europe) associated with our international operations could materially restrict our operations or expose us to additional risks; 

potential changes in tax laws, adverse positions taken by tax authorities or tax audits impacting our operating results; 

changes in competitive and technological factors affecting our operations; 

risks associated with the uncertainty of macroeconomic conditions worldwide (such as capital and credit markets conditions, inflation and interest rates); 

risks to our operations and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, from potential cyber-attacks; 

counterparty risks associated with reliance on key suppliers; 

challenges with estimating our potential liabilities related to our oil and natural gas property; 

risks associated with potential changes of Bureau of Ocean Energy Management BOEM security and bonding requirements for offshore platforms; 

the likelihood that the interests of our significant stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders; 

the risks associated with owning our Class A Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Class A Common Stock ), for which there is no public market; and 

the likelihood that our stockholders agreement may prevent certain transactions that could otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. 

These risks and other uncertainties related to our business are described in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Form 10-K ). We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

and , respectively, and was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for all periods is higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of .0 , primarily from non-deductible items and ongoing operations in foreign jurisdictions which have tax rates in excess of the U.S. federal statutory rate. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were favorably impacted by the utilization of foreign tax credits of million and million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was unfavorably impacted by the identification of an error in the tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 pertaining to certain net operating loss carryforwards that should have been eliminated as part of a worthless stock deduction taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. As such, we recognized an additional income tax expense of million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 with a corresponding decrease to deferred tax assets to correct this immaterial misstatement. Management has determined that this misstatement was not material to any of its previously issued financial statements. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was favorably impacted by approximately million in income tax benefits recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2023 from reversals of uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions and adjustments to valuation allowances on foreign operations. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development reached agreement on Pillar Two Model Rules Pillar Two to implement a minimum tax rate on certain multinational companies. Participating countries are in various stages of proposing and enacting tax laws to implement the Pillar Two framework. We determined these rules did not have a material impact on our taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we will continue to evaluate the impact of these proposals and legislative changes as new guidance emerges. We had approximately million in gross U.S. foreign tax credit deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance of million against them as of December 31, 2023. We continue to evaluate the realizability of our U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards and may have additional valuation allowance releases in future periods if we achieve positive cumulative income results of appropriate character and timing that provide sufficient positive evidence to do so. We had unrecognized tax benefits of million as of September 30, 2024 , all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized. It is reasonably possible that million of unrecognized tax benefits could be settled in the next twelve-month period due to the conclusion of tax audits or due to the expiration of statute of limitations. Unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 totaled million.

 The oil and gas industry is both cyclical and seasonal. The level of spending in the energy industry is heavily influenced by current and expected future prices of oil and natural gas. Changes in customer spending results in increased or decreased demand for our services and products. 
 
 Our financial performance is significantly affected by rig count, which is an indicator of the level of spending by oil and gas companies. The following table summarizes average rig counts in the U.S. land, U.S. offshore and International markets as well as prices of oil and natural gas.

Revenues and Cost of Revenues 
 
 Revenues from our Rentals segment decreased by 2.0 million, or 2.0 , in the Current Quarter as compared to the Prior Quarter. Revenues in our U.S land market declined from the Prior Quarter as demand in our premium drill pipe and bottom hole assembly product lines was impacted by the reduction in rig count and revenues from our U.S. offshore market were impacted by hurricane disruptions. This decline was partially offset by increased revenue in our U.S. offshore premium drill pipe product line. Cost of revenue for our Rentals segment decreased by 1.4 million, or 3.7 , particularly across our premium drill pipe service line for all markets. This resulted in an overall increased gross margin of 64.0 for the Current Quarter as compared to 63.3 in the Prior Quarter. 
 
 Revenues from our Well Services segment in the Current Quarter decreased 1.8 million, or 1.8 , from the Prior Quarter. The decrease in revenue in the Current Quarter was driven by declines in completion services in our U.S. offshore market. Cost of revenues increased 2.5 million, or 3.5 , in the Current Quarter as a result of importation costs in our international markets, specifically in our production services line. These changes resulted in a decline in gross margin for the Current Quarter to 25.4 from 29.2 for the Prior Quarter. 
 
 Restructuring and transaction expenses 
 
 Current Quarter restructuring and transaction expenses relate to costs associated with changes in our executive management during the period. 
 
 Loss on Blue Chip Swap securities 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024 we utilized Blue Chip Swaps to remit 8.1 million U.S. dollars from Argentina. The transaction resulted in a loss of 5.1 million during the Current Quarter. See " Note 10 - Blue Chip Swap Securities ". 
 
 Other income (expense), net 
 
 Gains on foreign currencies during the Current Quarter were 1.2 million compared to losses on foreign currencies during the Prior Quarter of 2.6 million and primarily relate to foreign currency transactions from our operations in Brazil and Argentina, which recognized currency gains in the Current Quarter of 0.4 million as compared to losses of 1.2 million and 0.9 million, respectively in the Prior Quarter. 
 18 

Income tax expense 
 
 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the Current Quarter and Prior Quarter was 23.1 and 31.2 , respectively. The effective tax rate for both periods is higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 , primarily from non-deductible items and ongoing operations in foreign jurisdictions which have tax rates in excess of the U.S. federal statutory rate. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the Current Quarter was favorably impacted by the utilization of foreign tax credits of 4.5 million. The effective tax rate for the Prior Quarter was unfavorably impacted by a valuation allowance of approximately 1.7 million established in a foreign jurisdiction. 
 
 Comparison of the Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 We reported net income from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (the Current Period of 89.3 million on revenue of 607.0 million. This compares to net income from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (the Prior Year Period") of 129.9 million on revenues of 675.0 million.

Revenues and Cost of Revenues 
 
 Revenues from our Rentals segment decreased 28.6 million, or 8.6 , in the Current Period as revenue decreased across all product service lines. Revenue was primarily impacted by declines in our premium drill pipe product lines in our U.S. land and U.S. offshore markets. The decline in U.S. revenues was partially offset by increases in revenue in our premium drill pipe product line within our International market. Gross margin decreased to 64.2 for the Current Period as compared to 67.3 in the Prior Year Period. 
 
 Revenues from our Well Services segment decreased 39.3 million, or 11.6 , in the Current Period, and cost of revenues decreased 24.3 million, or 10.2 , in the Current Period. These decreases were primarily a result of lower activity in our well control services product lines in our International markets. Gross margin for the Current Period decreased to 28.7 as compared to 29.8 for the Prior Year Period. 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased 9.6 million, or 10.4 , as compared to the Prior Year Period. This increase was primarily related to increases in employee related costs, including benefits and bonus compensation. 
 
 Restructuring and transaction expenses 
 
 19 

Current Period restructuring and transaction expenses relate to costs associated with changes in our executive management during the period. 
 
 Other gains, net 
 
 Other gains, net decreased 3.6 million during the Current Period from sales of fixed assets as compared to the Prior Year Period. 
 
 Loss on Blue Chip Swap securities 
 
 Loss on Blue Chip Swap transactions during the Current Period were 5.1 million as compared to 12.1 million in the Prior Year Period due to a higher volume of U.S. dollars swapped in the Prior Year Period. 
 
 Other expense, net 
 
 Losses on foreign currency during the Current Period and Prior Year Period were 3.1 million and 8.2 million, respectively, and primarily relate to foreign currency transactions from our operations in Argentina, which recognized losses of 1.0 million and 8.7 million during the Current Period and Prior Year Period, respectively. 
 
 Income tax expense 
 
 The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the Current Period and Prior Year Period was 28.0 and 25.6 , respectively. The effective tax rate for both periods is higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 , primarily from non-deductible items and ongoing operations in foreign jurisdictions which have tax rates in excess of the U.S. federal statutory rate. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the Current Period was favorably impacted by the utilization of foreign tax credits of 12.2 million and the reversals of uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions of 1.1 million and was unfavorably impacted by the establishment of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions of 2.3 million. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the Prior Year Period was unfavorably impacted by the identification of an error in the tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 pertaining to certain net operating loss carryforwards that should have been eliminated as part of a worthless stock deduction taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. As such, we recognized an additional income tax expense of 7.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 with a corresponding decrease to deferred tax assets to correct this immaterial misstatement. Management has determined that this misstatement was not material to any of its previously issued financial statements. 
 
 Additionally, the effective tax rate for the Prior Year Period was favorably impacted by approximately 14.9 million in income tax benefits recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2023 from reversals of uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions and adjustments to valuation allowances on foreign operations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our financial performance and cash flows depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Certain sources and uses of cash, such as our level of discretionary capital expenditures and divestitures of non-core assets, are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions. 
 
 Financial Condition and Liquidity 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from our operations and asset sales, and availability under our Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 380.6 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 225.2 million, and we received 3.6 million in cash proceeds from the sale of assets. The primary uses of liquidity are to provide support for our operations and capital expenditures. Cash paid for capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 67.4 million. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid a special cash dividend totaling 250.4 million to holders of our outstanding Class A Common Stock. 
 
 Debt Instruments 
 
 In December 2023, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement providing for up to a 140.0 million asset based secured revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility ). The issuance of letters of credit will reduce availability under the Credit Facility dollar-for-dollar. 
 20 

As of September 30, 2024, our borrowing base, as defined in the Credit Agreement, was approximately 89.9 million, and we had 39.5 million in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the borrowing availability to 50.4 million. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and were in compliance with all required covenants. 
 
 Other Matters 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no changes to the critical accounting policies reported in the Form 10-K that affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. Please refer to the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in commodity prices. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Risk 
 
 While we continue to be exposed to foreign currency exchange rates, we currently do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. When we believe it is prudent, we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we utilized an indirect foreign exchange mechanism known as a Blue Chip Swap. The transactions were completed at implied exchange rates that were approximately 63.0 higher than the official exchange rate, resulting in a loss of approximately 5.1 million during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Our revenues, profitability and future rate of growth significantly depend upon the market prices of oil and natural gas. Lower prices reduce the amount of oil and gas that can economically be produced. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation was carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
