 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the New Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the New Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate the proposed Business Combination with RET or any other Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period (November 25, 2024). These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The option to convert the Convertible Note into warrants qualifies as an embedded derivative under ASC 815 and is required to be recognized at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations each reporting period until the Convertible Note is repaid or converted. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the embedded conversion option had a de minimis value. The Company initially utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model for the initial valuation of the Public Warrants. The subsequent measurement of the Public Warrants was classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market under the ticker MITAW. In September 2023, the fair value measurements for Public Warrants were transferred to Level 2 due to low trading volume. The Company utilizes a modified Black-Scholes method to value the Private Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The estimated fair value of the Private Placement Warrants are determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its ordinary shares based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the date of valuation for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2, and 3 are recognized at the end of the reporting periods. The estimated fair value of the Public Warrants transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 1 fair value measurement after the Public Warrants were separately listed and traded in August 2021. Starting in September 2023, the fair value measurement for Public Warrants was transferred to Level 2 measurement due to low trading volume.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on February 5, 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination, involving one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial Business Combination . We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial Business Combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. The Company, RET, Holdco and the Merger Subs entered into the Business Combination Agreement on June 25, 2024, which was later amended on August 22, 2024, pursuant to which the parties will complete the SPAC Merger and the Company Merger, resulting in each of Merger Sub 1 and RET becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco. The transaction has a 10 million minimum cash condition among other material conditions to closing. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from February 5, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering described below and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of investment income on cash, cash equivalents and investments held after our Initial Public Offering and will recognize other income and expense related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 694,939, which resulted from general and administrative expenses of 1,059,346, loss that resulted from change in fair value of non-redemption agreement liabilities of 34,792, and change in fair value of deferred consulting fees of 6,069, and partially offset by interest income earned from cash and investments held in the Trust Account in the amount of 405,268.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 1,371,799, which resulted from general and administrative expenses of 2,478,245 (of which 1,780,733 was expenses relating to the proposed Business Combination with RET), loss which resulted from change in fair value of warrant liabilities of (82,250), change in fair value of non-redemption agreement liabilities of 23,600 and change in fair value of deferred consulting fees of 4,671, partially offset by interest income earned from cash held in the Trust Account in the amount of 1,216,967. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 632,719, which resulted from interest income earned from cash and investments held in the Trust Account in the amount of 759,910, and change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 246,750, and partially offset by general and administrative expenses of 373,941. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 2,692,821, which resulted from interest income earned from cash and investments held in the Trust Account in the amount of 4,288,824, and a gain from extinguishment of deferred underwriting fees allocated to warrant liabilities of 275,625, partially offset by a loss on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 658,000 and general and administrative expenses of 839,687. Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern Consideration For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 0, which was due to net loss of 1,371,799, non-cash adjustments to net loss related to losses from change in its fair value of non-redemption agreements of 23,600, change in fair value of deferred consulting fees of 4,671, change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 82,250, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2,478,245, partially offset by interest earned from cash held in Trust Account of 1,216,967. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 273,922, which was due to non-cash adjustments to net income related to a gain on investments held in the Trust Account of 4,288,824, and a gain from extinguishment of deferred underwriting fees allocated to warrant liabilities of 275,625, partially offset by net income of 2,692,821 and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 939,705, the non-cash adjustments to net income related to change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 658,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 12,131,639, which was the result of the cash withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay for redemptions of 12,181,639, partially offset by a 50,000 cash New Contribution deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Combination Period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was 94,296,372, which was due to cash withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay for redemptions, partially offset by 400,000 cash Contributions deposited into Trust Account in connection with the extensions of the Combination Period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 12,131,639, which was due to amount paid out to shareholders for redemptions of 12,181,639, partially offset by a 50,000 cash New Contribution deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Combination Period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 94,255,486, which was due to the amount paid out to shareholders for redemptions and the repayment of 9,114 in advances from the Previous Sponsor, partially offset by 400,000 cash Contributions deposited into the Trust Account received under the Convertible Note from related party in connection with the extensions of the Combination Period, and 50,000 in cash advanced by the Previous Sponsor. As of September 30, 2024, we had no cash held outside of the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of 4,797,417. We have incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. In addition, in order to provide the Contributions and New Contributions and to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, we issued a Convertible Note to the New Sponsor with a principal amount up to 1.5 million on June 22, 2023 as discussed above. As of September 30, 2024, we had 550,000 outstanding under the Convertible Note. On October 25, 2024, we borrowed an additional 50,000 under the Convertible Note to deposit in the Trust Account as a New Contribution in connection with the extension through November 25, 2024, increasing the aggregate outstanding balance under the Convertible Note to 600,000.

 In connection with the management s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 210-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, our management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the earlier of the liquidation date or the completion of the initial Business Combination. We plan to address this uncertainty through a consummating the proposed Business Combination with RET or another Business Combination. There is no assurance that our plans to consummate the proposed Business Combination with RET or another Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period (September 25, 2024). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Contractual Obligations Registration Rights The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Convertible Note or other working capital loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the conversion of the Class B ordinary shares or exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants issued upon conversion of the Convertible Note) are entitled to registration rights requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to Class A ordinary shares). The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggyback registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement We granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments at the Initial Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions, which the underwriter did not exercise and expired on August 6, 2021. The underwriter was paid a cash underwriting fee of 0.20 per unit, or 3,000,000 in the aggregate. In addition, 0.375 per unit, or 5,625,000 in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriter as a Deferred Underwriting Fee. The Deferred Underwriting Fee was to become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Effective as of June 12, 2023, the underwriter of our Initial Public Offering resigned and withdrew from its role in any Business Combination and waived its entitlement to the Deferred Underwriting Fee in the amount of 5,625,000. We recognized 5,349,375 of the Deferred Underwriting Fee waiver as a reduction to the carrying value of Public Shares subject to redemption with the remaining balance of 275,625 recognized as a gain from extinguishment of liability allocated to warrant liabilities in the statements of operations, which represents the original amount expensed in our Initial Public Offering. Convertible Promissory Note Related Parties In connection with the Contributions and New Contributions and advances our New Sponsor may make in the future to us for working capital expenses, on June 22, 2023, we issued a Convertible Note to our New Sponsor with a principal amount up to 1.5 million. The Convertible Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of our initial Business Combination, or (b) the date of our liquidation. If we do not consummate an initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, the Convertible Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of 1.50 per warrant, at the option of our New Sponsor. Such warrants will have terms identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 550,000 outstanding under the Convertible Note. On October 25, 2024, we borrowed an additional 50,000 under the Convertible Note to deposit in the Trust Account as a New Contribution in connection with the extension through November 25, 2024, increasing the aggregate outstanding balance under the Convertible Note to 600,000. The option to convert the Convertible Note into warrants qualifies as an embedded derivative under ASC 815 and is required to be recognized at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in our statements of operations each reporting period until the

Table of Contents 
 Convertible Note is repaid or converted. As of the funding date and September 30, 2024, the fair value of the embedded conversion option had a de minimis value. Non-Redemption Agreements In connection with the November Meeting, our Company and an affiliate of our New Sponsor, Harry L. You, entered into Non-Redemption Agreements with Non-Redeeming Shareholders, pursuant to which the Non-Redeeming Shareholders agreed not to redeem an aggregate of 2,023,236 Public Shares and to vote all of such shares in favor of the proposals brought before the November Meeting. In exchange for these commitments from the Non-Redeeming Shareholders, Mr. You agreed to forfeit at the closing of our initial Business Combination an aggregate of 606,971 Forfeited Shares, and we agreed to issue to the Non-Redeeming Shareholders a number of newly issued ordinary shares of our company in an amount equal to the Forfeited Shares. Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, the Previous Sponsor agreed that it would share in such forfeitures, pro rata. Our management determined that the contingent share forfeiture by Mr. You and the Previous Sponsor and contingent share issuance to the Non-Redeeming Shareholders is a single unit of account. The Contingent Forward is classified as a liability. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of the Contingent Forward was 218,277 and 194,677, respectively. We recognized a loss in change in the fair value of non-redemption agreements of 34,792 and 23,600 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Deferred Consulting Fee On November 22, 2023, the Company engaged a consultant who also holds the Company s Public Shares to provide the Company with consulting, advisory and related services with respect to the proxy statement that was approved in the November Meeting on November 27, 2023. The Company agreed to pay the consultant aggregate cash fees totaling 250,000 and a Deferred Consulting Fee at the closing of the Business Combination, following the satisfaction of redemption demands validly submitted by the consultant. At that time, we shall pay the consultant directly from the Trust Account the Share Consideration Payment in cash. In order for the consultant to receive the Share Consideration Payment, the consultant must not redeem 100,000 Public Shares at the time of the Business Combination redemption deadline. If the consultant does not hold 100,000 Public Shares through the redemption deadline for the Business Combination, the consultant will receive 100,000 Founder Shares at the closing of the Business Combination in lieu of the Share Consideration Payment. The obligation, which may be share-settled, is an equity-linked financial instrument that is required to be recognized as a liability at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the Company s statements of operations. We recognized the initial fair value of the Deferred Consulting Fee as a liability, upon execution of the consulting agreement in November 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Deferred Consulting Fee was 35,904 and 31,233, respectively. Loss resulted from change in fair value of such instrument of 6,069 and 4,671 was recognized in the Company s statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The estimated fair value of the Deferred Consulting Fee is determined using Level 3 inputs. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following accounting policies as those that require significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and that have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These policies are considered critical because they may result in fluctuations in our reported results from period to period due to the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and because the use of different judgments, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions.

 Derivative Financial Instruments We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. The assessment considers whether the financial instruments are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the financial instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the financial instruments are indexed to our own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and at each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the liability-classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The initial estimated fair value of the Public Warrants was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The initial and subsequent fair value estimates of the Private Placement Warrants and the subsequent fair value estimates of the Public Warrants when trading volume is low are measured using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model. The contingent share receipt and contingent share issuance called for in the Non-Redemption Agreements is a single unit of account, representing a Contingent Forward. Issuance of the Contingent Forward is liability-classified until exercise or expiration of the Optional Extension, at which time classification of the Contingent Forward will be re-assessed. The initial fair value of the Contingent Forward was recognized as a liability in the balance sheet with an offset to non-operating expenses. Subsequent changes in fair value of the liability are recognized in earnings until such time that the instrument ceases to be liability-classified or settles. The Deferred Consulting Fees, which may be share-settled, was an equity-linked financial instrument that was required to be recognized as a liability at fair value. The initial fair value of the Deferred Consulting Fees was recognized as a liability in the balance sheets with an offset to non-operating expenses. Subsequent changes in fair value of the liability are recognized in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Public Shares Subject to Possible Redemption The Public Shares issued in our Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with our liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the business combination and in connection with certain amendments to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480, redemption provisions not solely within our control require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, the carrying value of all Public Shares have been classified outside of permanent equity. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable Public Shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit. Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Remeasurement associated with the Class A ordinary shares is excluded from net income per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Therefore, the net income (loss) per share calculation allocates income shared pro rata between Public Shares and a combination of Class B and non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares. As a result, the calculated net income per ordinary share is the same for Public Shares and a combination of Class B and non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares. We have not considered the effect of the outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8,225,000 shares in the calculation of diluted net income per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share is the same as basic income per share for the periods presented.

 Recent Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. This item is not applicable as we are a smaller reporting company. ITEM 4. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Report are any of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 5, 2024 (the Annual Report ). Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Annual Report, except as set forth below. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. The Articles contravene Nasdaq rules, and as a result, could lead Nasdaq to suspend trading in the Company s securities or lead the Company to be delisted from Nasdaq. Nasdaq rule IM-5101-2 requires that a SPAC complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its Initial Public Offering registration statement, which, in the Company s case, was June 22, 2024. The Company has the ability to extend the Combination Period to up to December 25, 2024. As a result, the Articles do not comply with Nasdaq rule IM-5101-2. On June 25, 2024, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market stating that, due to the Company s non-compliance with Nasdaq Rule IM-5101-2, its securities would be subject to suspension and delisting at the opening of business on July 5, 2024, unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. The Company submitted a hearing request and the hearing was held on August 8, 2024. On August 14, 2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel notified the Company that it granted the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq and an exception to Nasdaq IM-5101-2. Specifically, the Company will now have 180 days from the date of the delisting notice, or until December 23, 2024, to complete its initial Business Combination, provided that the Company provides the Hearings Panel with certain progress updates relating to the status of the Business Combination. If Nasdaq delists the Company s securities from trading on its exchange and the Company is not able to list its securities on another national securities exchange, the Company expects such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, the Company could face significant material adverse consequences, including. inability to meet a condition to closing the Business Combination, as there can be no assurance that RET would waive the Nasdaq listing condition to closing set forth in the Business Combination Agreement; a determination that the Class A ordinary shares are a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in the Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for its securities, and being a penny stock issuer may prevent the Company from consummating a Business Combination pursuant to the Articles; a limited availability of market quotations for the Company s securities; reduced liquidity for the Company s securities; a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS On June 25, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 15,000,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 150,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 3,225,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Coliseum Acquisition Sponsor LLC, generating gross proceeds of 4,837,500. Prior to the Initial Public Offering, the Previous Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 4,312,500 Founder Shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000, or approximately 0.006 per share. In connection with the Transfer Transaction a portion of the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants were transferred from the Previous Sponsor to the New Sponsor. Transaction costs amounted to 9,176,463 consisting of 3,000,000 of underwriting fees, 5,625,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and 551,463 of other offering costs. We were reimbursed 750,000 by the underwriter for such transaction costs. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on June 25, 2021, an amount of 150,000,000 10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the Trust Account. Following redemptions in connection with the First Extension and the Second Extension, we currently have 31,781,457 held in the Trust Account. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our Initial Public Offering as described in our final prospectus dated June 22, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on June 24, 2021, though the amount available has decreased as a result of redemptions. On June 12, 2023, we received a formal letter from our underwriter in the Initial Public Offering advising that it had waived any entitlement it may have to the deferred underwriting fee of 5,625,000. The securities sold in our Initial Public Offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-254513). The SEC declared the registration statement effective on June 22, 2021. The issuance of the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants were made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5.
