These assets are currently reflected on our balance sheet as of the end of the current quarter. However, the Audit Committee subsequently determined that Quote Me Sdn. Bhd. was a dissolved entity which raises concerns over the legitimacy of the transaction. If the transaction is rescinded, it would impact the Company s balance sheet as of the December 31, 2024 fiscal year end, potentially requiring adjustments to reduce both asset and liability accounts related to this transaction. Additionally, any previously recognized expenses, capitalized assets, or amortization related to the acquired know-how and machinery would need to be reconsidered, which could affect the profit or loss statements for the affected periods.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the US Dollar. Therefore, any change in the relevant exchange rate would require us to recognize a transaction gain or loss on revaluation. For the nine-months period ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a foreign currency gain of 839,344 as compared with a foreign currency loss of 391,533 for the same period in 2023. 32 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 5,635,310 compared with working capital of 6,415,877 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in working capital as of September 30, 2024 was due principally to investments and expansion of operations. Our primary uses of cash had been for operations and strategic investments. The main sources of cash were generated from operational revenues, the private placement of our common stock, and the proceeds of our public offering. The following trends could result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to long term: Addition of administrative and marketing personnel as the business grows, Increases in advertising and marketing in order to attempt to generate more revenues, and The cost of being a public company. The Company believes that cash flow from operations together will be sufficient to sustain its current level of operations for at least the next 12 months of operations.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this item. 33 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information was accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Recent internal reviews of various transactions occurring subsequent to the end of the current reporting period (September 30, 2024) identified areas for improvement within Chemrex, particularly in relation to documentation, transaction approval processes, and related-party transaction oversight. This review was further necessary after the resignation of Mr. Wei Foong Lim on October 9, 2024. Mr. Lim served as a director of both BioNexus Gene Lab Corp. and Chemrex. This resignation has prompted a reassessment of governance controls at Chemrex. Management and the audit committee are implementing strengthened review and authorization procedures to address any potential control gaps, thereby reinforcing compliance with internal governance standards and regulatory expectations. These actions are expected to enhance the Company s internal controls going forward. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process, under the supervision of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i) Pertain to the maintenance of records that is in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; ii) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and the board of directors; and iii) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company s management had assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and this assessment identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting had shown improvement. A material weakness could create reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in annual or interim financial statements. The management considers its internal control over financial reporting required further improvement. This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting During the period ended September 30, 2024, there had been no change in internal control over financial reporting that had materially affected or was reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 34 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
