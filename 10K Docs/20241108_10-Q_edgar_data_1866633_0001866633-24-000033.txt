 and , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The decrease in the Company s effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the change in the geographical mix of income.

 The Company s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21 primarily as a result of state income taxes, nondeductible expenses for tax purposes, foreign rate differential, research and development credits and uncertain tax positions.

 Vested Restricted Stock 
 At the time of certain vesting events related to restricted stock units or restricted stock awards that are held by participants in Consensus Equity Incentive Plan, a portion of the awards subject to vesting are withheld by the Company to satisfy the employees tax withholding obligations that arise upon the vesting of restricted stock. As a result, the number of shares issued upon vesting for these awards is net of the statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays on behalf of its employees. Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common share repurchases in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These shares do not count against the authorized capacity under the Company s share repurchase program described above.

 The Company has awarded restricted stock and restricted stock units to its Board of Directors and certain employees pursuant to the 2021 Plan. Compensation expense resulting from restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants is measured at fair value on the date of grant and is recognized as share-based compensation expense over the applicable vesting period.

Key Performance Metrics 
 We use the following metrics to generally assess the operational and financial performance of our business, including the growth of our business, the value provided by customers to our business and our customer retention that provide insights that contribute to certain of our business planning decisions. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. 
 
 The following table sets forth certain key performance metrics for our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages and Average Revenue per Customer Account): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue

 (1) Consensus customers are defined as paying Corporate and SoHo customer accounts. 
 (2) Represents a monthly ARPA for the quarter or year-to-date period, calculated as follows: Monthly ARPA on a quarterly basis is calculated using our standard convention of dividing revenue for the quarter by the average of the quarter s beginning and ending customer base and dividing that amount by 3 months. Monthly ARPA on a year-to-date basis is calculated by dividing revenue for the year-to-date period by the average customer base for the applicable period and dividing that amount by the respective period. We believe ARPA provides investors an understanding of the average monthly revenues we recognize per account associated within Consensus customer base. As ARPA varies based on fixed subscription fee and variable usage components, we believe it can serve as a measure by which investors can evaluate trends in the types of services, levels of services and the usage levels of those services across Consensus customers. 
 (3) Paid Adds represents paying new Consensus customer accounts added during the periods presented. 
 -25- 

(4) Monthly churn represents paid monthly SoHo and Corporate customer accounts that were cancelled during each month of the quarter or year-to-date period divided by the average number of customers during each month of the same quarter or year-to-date period (including the paid adds). The period measured is the quarter or year-to-date and expressed as a monthly churn rate over the respective period. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 In the ordinary course of business, we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our critical accounting policies are described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The main strategic focus of our Consensus offerings is to enable our customers to securely and cooperatively access, exchange and use information across organizational, regional and national boundaries. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to enhance our existing offerings and offer new services to continue to satisfy the evolving needs of our customers. 
 
 We expect our business to primarily grow organically and inorganically through the use of capital for re-investment in the business and opportunistic acquisitions that expedite our product roadmap in the interoperability space should they arise.

 Revenues decreased by 2.8 million or 3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year comparable period. The decrease was due to a decline of 5.5 million or 14 in our SoHo business, partially offset by an increase of 2.7 million or 5 in our corporate business. 
 
 Revenues decreased by 11.4 million or 4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year comparable period. The decrease was due to a decline of 17.4 million or 14 in our SoHo business, partially offset by an increase of 6.0 million or 4 in our corporate business.

Our sales personnel consist of a combination of inside sales and outside sales professionals. 
 
 The decrease in sales and marketing expenses of 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year comparable period was primarily due to a reduction in third party advertising spend of 2.7 million, predominantly in SoHo.

 -27- 

The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year comparable period was primarily due to decreases of 1.5 million in personnel-related expenses and 1.4 million in professional fees. 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 The following table represents share-based compensation expense included in cost of revenues and operating expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cost of revenues 465 309 1,449 939 Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 592 375 1,856 1,134 Research, development and engineering 95 61 260 153 General and administrative 2,270 3,009 8,045 11,331 Total 3,422 3,754 11,610 13,557 
 Non-Operating Income and Expenses 
 Interest expense . Our interest expense is due to outstanding debt and is reduced by any capitalized interest. Interest expense was 9.8 million and 12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 24.6 million and 38.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease between periods was primarily due to the partial extinguishment of debt, resulting in a gain of 0.1 million and 6.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Interest income. Our interest income is generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalents. Interest income was 0.7 million and 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.2 million and 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the prior year comparable period as the Company decreased its investment in money market funds in order to repurchase long-term debt. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was consistent with the prior year comparable period. 
 
 Other (expense) income, net . Our other (expense) income, net is generated primarily from foreign currency and miscellaneous items. Other (expense) income, net was (2.1) million and 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.5 million and 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change between periods was primarily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany balances between periods in foreign subsidiaries that were in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. We believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Certain of these tax positions have, in the past been challenged, and this may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate if our tax reserves are insufficient. 
 
 Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax regulations and different tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax basis of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize. When necessary, we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. 
 
 The provision for income taxes was 6.1 million and 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 24.7 million and 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 -28- 

Our effective tax rate was 22.5 and 23.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 25.7 and 23.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the change in the geographical mix of income. The increase in our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the change in the geographical mix of income, an increase in the valuation allowance and an increase in state taxes on foreign earnings not permanently reinvested. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 54.6 million compared to 88.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from cash used for debt repurchases, capitalized expenditures and common stock repurchases, partially offset by cash provided by operations. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents held within domestic and foreign jurisdictions were 29.3 million and 25.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 On March 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with certain lenders party thereto (collectively, the Lenders and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as agent (the Agent ). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have provided Consensus with a revolving credit facility of 25.0 million (the Credit Facility with an option held by the Company to obtain an additional commitment of up to a maximum of 25.0 million. The final maturity of the Credit Facility will occur on March 4, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, no amount had been drawn down on the Credit Facility. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our long-term contractual obligations generally include our debt and related interest payments, noncancellable operating leases as well as other commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 618.2 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 7 - Long-Term Debt of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) and total minimum lease payments of 18.0 million, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.9 years. As of September 30, 2024, our liability for uncertain tax positions was 11.9 million. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments. 
 
 We currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, stock and debt repurchases, if any, for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 
 
 Debt Repurchase Program 
 On November 9, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a debt repurchase program, pursuant to which Consensus may reduce, through redemptions, open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated purchases or other retirements, a combination of the outstanding principal balance of the 2026 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes Debt Repurchase Program ). The authorization permits an aggregate principal amount reduction of up to 300.0 million and expires on November 9, 2026. The timing and amounts of purchases will be determined by the Company, depending on market conditions and other factors it deems relevant. Any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt are recognized in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had retired an aggregate of 186.8 million in principal of its senior notes under this program. In connection with the Company s Debt Repurchase Program (see Note 7 - Long-Term Debt), the Company paid 9.2 million, which includes accrued interest, to repurchase 9.1 million in principal of its senior notes subsequent to the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Common Stock Repurchase Program 
 On March 1, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share buyback program. Under this program, the Company may purchase in the public market or in off-market transactions up to 100.0 million worth of the Company s common stock through February 2025. The timing and amounts of purchases will be determined by the Company, depending on market conditions and other factors it deems relevant. The Company entered into Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 trading plans 
 -29- 

under this program. There were no shares repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 under this program. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 the Company repurchased 152,399 shares under this program at an aggregate cost of 3.8 million, inclusive of excise tax of 0.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 42,962 and 490,953 shares, respectively, at an aggregate cost of 0.7 million and 15.1 million, respectively, inclusive of excise tax of zero and 0.1 million, respectively. Cumulatively as of September 30, 2024, 1,071,624 shares have been repurchased under this program at an aggregate cost of 32.0 million (inclusive of excise tax of 0.2 million). The excise tax is assessed at 1 of the fair market value of net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. 
 Vested Restricted Stock 
 At the time of certain vesting events related to restricted stock units or restricted stock awards that are held by participants in Consensus Equity Incentive Plan, a portion of the awards subject to vesting are withheld by the Company to satisfy the employees tax withholding obligations that arise upon the vesting of restricted stock. As a result, the number of shares issued upon vesting for these awards is net of the statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays on behalf of its employees. Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common share repurchases in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These shares do not count against the authorized capacity under the Company s share repurchase program described above. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company withheld shares on its vested restricted stock units and restricted stock awards relating to its share-based compensation plans of 3,489 shares and 2,412 shares, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company withheld shares on its vested restricted stock units and restricted stock awards relating to its share-based compensation plans of 40,396 shares and 35,368 shares, respectively. 
 Cash Flows 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was 110.6 million and 112.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our operating cash flows resulted primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we made to third parties for their services and employee compensation. The decrease in our net cash provided by operating activities over the prior comparable period was primarily attributable to a decrease in our net working capital accounts of 3.4 million, partially offset by increased income of 1.9 million after excluding noncash items. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 25.5 million and 32.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment (including capitalized labor). The decrease in our net cash used in investing activities over the prior comparable period was primarily attributable to less cash used for investments and capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment (including capitalized labor). 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 116.8 million and 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to cash outlays the Company used to repurchase a portion of its outstanding senior notes debt facilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to cash used to repurchase common stock. The change in net cash used in financing activities over the prior comparable period was primarily attributable to an increase in cash outflows related to the repurchase of our debt in the current period, which was absent in the prior period, partially offset by a decrease in the repurchases of the Company s common stock. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The following discussion of the market risks we face contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof. Consensus undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Readers should carefully review the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form 8-K filed or to be filed by us in 2024. 
 
 -30- 

Interest Rate Risk 
 Our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value. Our return on these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalent investments, primarily in money market funds and cash held in foreign and domestic bank accounts, of 54.6 million and 88.7 million, respectively. We do not have interest rate risk on our outstanding long-term debt as these arrangements have fixed interest rates. 
 We cannot ensure that future interest rate movements will not have a material adverse effect on our future business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. To date, we have not entered into interest rate hedging transactions to control or minimize certain of these risks. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our principal exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investment and intercompany debt in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and the Japanese Yen. If we are unable to settle our short-term intercompany debts in a timely manner, we remain exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 
 As we expand our international presence, we become further exposed to foreign currency risk by entering new markets with additional foreign currencies. The economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies. 
 
 As currency exchange rates change, translation of the income statements of the international businesses into U.S. Dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results, the impact of which is immaterial to the comparisons set forth in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Historically, we have not hedged translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally; however, we may do so in the future. Our objective in managing foreign exchange risk is to minimize the potential exposure to changes that exchange rates might have on earnings, cash flows and our financial position. We currently do not have derivative financial instruments for hedging, speculative or trading purposes and therefore are not subject to such hedging risk. However, we may in the future engage in hedging transactions to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 Foreign exchange (loss) gain was (2.1) million and 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Foreign exchange gain was 2.5 million and 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in foreign exchange gain was primarily attributable to the translation of certain intra-entity balances in foreign currencies. 
 
 Cumulative translation adjustment gain (loss), included in other comprehensive income, was 6.1 million and (6.2) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cumulative translation adjustment loss, included in other comprehensive income, was 1.6 million and 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such 
 -31- 

term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which occurred during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
