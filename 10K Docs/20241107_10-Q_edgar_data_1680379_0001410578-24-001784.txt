The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC of the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and is a member of the FRB system and Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB system. (b) Proposed Sale of the Bank and Dissolution of the Company On September 15, 2024, the Company and the Bank entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement with EverBank Financial Corp, a Delaware corporation EverBank ), which provides for the Company to sell all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Bank to EverBank for a fixed purchase price of to be paid in cash to the Company (the Transaction ). Following the completion of the Transaction, EverBank will cause the Bank to merge with and into EverBank, National Association, the bank subsidiary of EverBank, with EverBank, National Association as the surviving bank and following the bank merger, the separate corporate existence of the Bank will cease.

In addition, EverBank s obligation to complete the Transaction is also subject to the following conditions: (i) the sale by the Bank of its portfolio of residential tenant-in-common loans (with an aggregate principal balance of approximately at September 30, 2024) and receipt by the Bank of the purchase price specified in such agreement and (ii) the average daily closing balance of the Bank s deposits for the monthly period ending on the last day of the month before closing is not less than of the average daily closing balance of such deposits for the monthly period ending on July 31, 2024. Simultaneously with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Bank entered into the mortgage loan purchase agreement (the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement with Bayview Acquisitions LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Bayview ). The Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement provides that Bayview will purchase the Bank s residential tenant-in-common loans for an aggregate purchase price equal to of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the loans on the agreed upon purchase date plus all accrued and unpaid interest. The Bank s obligation to consummate the sale contemplated by the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement is subject to certain conditions, including the receipt by the Bank of evidence of the shareholder and regulatory approvals required for the Transaction. As of September 30, 2024, the residential tenant-in-common loans were not held for sale as the Bank s intent to liquidate its tenant-in-common loan portfolio is based upon its ability to close the Transaction and receipt of the required approvals for the Transaction. The closing of the loan sale is to occur immediately prior to the closing of the Transaction.

These loans were collateralized by residential real estate property and the fair value of collateral on substantially all collateral-dependent loans were significantly in excess of their amortized cost basis. Modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may include interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness, forbearances, term extensions, and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Historically, the Company has provided loan forbearances to residential borrowers when mandated and modified construction loans by providing term extensions. The Company did not have any loans held for investment to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were modified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company did not have any loans held for investment to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were previously modified that subsequently defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate and other consumer loans, and non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans. This analysis is performed at least quarterly. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company s credit position at some future date. Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the loan. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above-described process are considered Pass-rated loans.

Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the items set forth under Part II, Item A. Risk Factors. Company Overview We are a unitary thrift holding company incorporated in 1989 and headquartered in Southfield, Michigan, and our primary business is the operation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Sterling Bank, which was formed in 1984. Through Sterling Bank, we currently originate commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, and provide deposit products, consisting primarily of checking, savings and term certificate accounts. The Bank also engages in mortgage banking activities and, as such, acquires, sells and services residential mortgage loans. The Bank operates through a network of 27 branches of which 25 branches are located in the San Francisco and Los Angeles, California metropolitan areas with the remaining branches located in New York, New York and Southfield, Michigan. Sale of the Bank and Dissolution of the Company On September 15, 2024, we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with EverBank, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, EverBank will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Bank from the Company for a fixed purchase price of 261.0 million to be paid in cash to the Company. Afterward, EverBank will cause the Bank to merge with and into EverBank, National Association, the bank subsidiary of EverBank, with EverBank, National Association as the surviving bank. At that time, the separate corporate existence of the Bank will cease. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from both EverBank and us, and we have agreed to customary covenants.

 The Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, among which include the approval of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Transaction and the Plan of Dissolution by the requisite vote of the Company s shareholders and the receipt of required regulatory approvals. In addition, EverBank s obligation to complete the Transaction is also subject to the following conditions: (i) the sale by the Bank of its portfolio of residential tenant-in-common loans (with an aggregate principal balance of approximately 359.6 million at September 30, 2024) and receipt by the Bank of the purchase price and (ii) the average daily closing balance of the Bank s deposits for the monthly period ending on the last day of the month before closing is not less than 85 of the average daily closing balance of such deposits for the monthly period ending on July 31, 2024. Simultaneously with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement for the Transaction, the Bank entered into the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement with Bayview. The Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement provides that Bayview will purchase the Bank s residential tenant-in-common mortgage loans. The Bank s obligation to consummate the sale contemplated by the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement is subject to certain conditions, including the receipt by the Bank of evidence of the shareholder and regulatory approvals required for the Transaction. Also on September 15, 2024, our board of directors unanimously approved the Plan of Dissolution, which provides for the dissolution of the Company under Michigan law, subject to shareholder approval. If the Plan of Dissolution is approved, we intend to file a certificate of dissolution with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs and distribute all remaining assets, expected to be all cash, to our shareholders according to their respective rights and interests. We expect to make an initial distribution shortly after the closing of the Transaction and filing of the certificate of dissolution, with the final distribution subject to first completing the wind down of the Company and paying or providing for the Company s creditors and existing and reasonably foreseeable debts, liabilities, and obligations in accordance with Michigan law and the Plan of Dissolution. Overview of Quarterly Performance Our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflect a net loss as we engaged in an extensive effort to negotiate and finalize the terms of the Transaction while continuing to work to protect both book value and liquidity. We believe our credit quality, liquidity and capital ratios are robust. Total assets increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, with cash and due from banks increasing primarily due to net cash inflows from growth in deposits and a decline in loans. Market interest rates continue to exert pressure on our net interest margin. Our net loss was (0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects a decline in net interest income from 16.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 13.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decline in our net interest income primarily reflects a significant increase in our deposit costs in the higher interest rate environment, which outpaced the increase in the yields we earned on our interest-earning assets. Our non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was essentially unchanged from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in non-interest expense of 2.1 million, or 12 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a 1.2 million decrease in professional fees, although results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included increased professional fees incurred in connection with the Transaction. Professional fees decreased substantially as the last of the government investigations against the Company and the Bank were resolved in 2023. Our credit quality remained strong overall, though nonperforming residential real estate loans have increased during 2024. Our nonperforming assets, consisting entirely of residential real estate loans, were 13.2 million, or 0.54 of total assets, at September 30, 2024 compared to 9.0 million, or 0.37 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. In addition, our provision for (recovery of) credit losses was (2.3) million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (1.9) million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Tier 1 capital to average total assets (leverage) ratios of both the Company and the Bank remained above the capital ratio requirements to be considered well capitalized under the applicable prompt corrective action requirements.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and with general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances. These assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent, objective sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our accounting policies that we believe are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, which critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. Balance Sheet and Capital Analysis Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated.

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 76 of our loan portfolio was based in California with 53 and 23 in the San Francisco and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, respectively. Residential Loans. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans. Our residential loans totaled 904.4 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 181.3 million, or 17 , from 1.1 billion at December 31, 2023. This decrease includes loan payoffs prior to maturity of 132.6 million that have occurred since December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, residential real estate loans accounted for 74 of total gross loans held for investment. Our residential real estate loans include a former loan product, consisting of one-, three-, five- or seven-year adjustable-rate mortgages that required a down payment of at least 35 , that was terminated in 2019, and continues to be the largest portion of our residential loans. This former loan product totaled 486.0 million, or 54 of gross residential loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 628.2 million, or 58 of gross residential loans at December 31, 2023. In early 2023, the Bank discontinued originating residential real estate loans. No new residential real estate loans were added to our residential loan portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Commercial Loans. We offer a variety of commercial loan products, consisting of commercial real estate loans, construction loans and commercial and industrial loans. These categories of commercial loans totaled 319.3 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 56.1 million from December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated commercial loans with an aggregate principal balance of 59.3 million and 125.0 million, respectively, at the time of origination. The majority of our commercial loans are secured by real estate or other business assets. Our commercial loans are almost exclusively recourse loans, as we generally obtain personal guarantees on each loan. Commercial real estate loans totaled 306.9 million at September 30, 2024, of which the largest portion of these loans, or 39 , are secured by multifamily properties. The repayment of commercial real estate loans is often more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general business climate and economy because it is dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved. In addition, the collateral for commercial real estate loans is generally less readily marketable than for residential real estate loans, and its value may be more difficult to determine. A primary repayment risk for commercial real estate loans is the interruption or discontinuation of operating cash flows from the properties or businesses involved, which may be influenced by economic events, changes in governmental regulations, vacancies or other events not under the control of the borrower. Additionally, with the higher interest rate environment and slowed transaction market, the commercial real estate sector may face increased risk of economic distress. The table below summarizes the commercial real estate loan portfolio, by property type, as of September 30, 2024: 

At September 30, 2024 Percent of Amount Total (Dollars in thousands) Commercial real estate: Retail 57,192 19 Multifamily 119,760 39 Office 38,882 13 Hotels/Single-room occupancy hotels 3,501 1 Industrial 54,243 18 Mixed-Use 10,723 3 Other 22,626 7 Total 306,927 100 Our construction loans decreased to 5.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 10.4 million at December 31, 2023 due to construction loans that matured and were paid in full during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our commercial and industrial loans totaled 7.2 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 8.7 million from December 31, 2023. The decrease is attributable to payments of loan principal of 14.0 million related to a shorter term loan which was partially offset by the addition of a new loan with a principal balance of 5.7 million at origination. Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates. The Company s loan portfolio includes adjustable-rate loans, primarily tied to Prime, U.S. Treasuries and the secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), and fixed-rate loans, for which the interest rate does not change through the original or remaining life of the loan. The following table sets forth the recorded investment by interest rate type in our loan portfolio at September 30, 2024:

 Across our loan portfolio, our adjustable-rate loans are typically based on a 30-year amortization schedule and generally interest rates and payments adjust annually after a one-, three-, five- or seven-year initial fixed period. Our prime-based loans, which typically are commercial and industrial loans, construction loans and home equity loans, adjust to an interest rate equal to Prime or up to 238 basis points above Prime. Our commercial real estate loans predominately adjust based on the U.S. Treasury five-year constant maturity Treasury rate. Interest rates on our adjustable-rate SOFR-based loans adjust to an interest rate typically equal to 350 to 450 basis points above the one-year SOFR. Our Treasury-based residential loans adjust to an interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury one- and five-year constant maturity Treasury rates. The following table sets forth the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio and sensitivities of those loans to changes in interest rates at September 30, 2024. Overdraft loans are reported as being due in one year or less. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments that could significantly shorten the average life of all loans and may cause our actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below.

Asset Quality Nonperforming Assets. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Other than nonperforming loans, we do not have any other nonperforming assets. Restructuring of loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are accounted for as a loan modification and further evaluated as to classification of a performing or nonperforming asset.

 In addition, a loan may be placed on nonaccrual at any other time management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest according to the contractual terms, even though the loan is currently performing or when a loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest. For nonaccrual loans, interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against income at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. The following table sets forth information regarding our nonperforming loans at the dates indicated. 

At September 30, At December 31, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Nonaccrual loans (1) : Residential real estate 13,187 8,942 Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest 27 31 Total nonperforming loans 13,214 8,973 Total loans (1) 1,223,737 1,348,972 Total assets 2,438,554 2,416,003 Nonaccrual loans to total loans 1.08 0.66 Nonperforming loans to total assets 0.54 0.37 

 (1) Loans are classified as held for investment and are presented before the allowance for credit losses. 
 As of September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets, comprised primarily of nonaccrual residential real estate loans, totaled 13.2 million, an increase of 4.2 million from December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to residential loans of 9.8 million added to nonaccrual status. This increase was partially offset by loans totaling 2.5 million that were returned to accrual status, loans paid in full totaling 2.1 million and other payments of loan principal totaling 1.0 million. As a result of the increase in nonaccrual loans, the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans increased to 1.08 at September 30, 2024 from 0.66 at December 31, 2023. Also, our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets increased to 0.54 at September 30, 2024 from 0.37 at December 31, 2023. The total amount of additional interest income on nonaccrual loans that would have been recorded if the interest on all such loans had been recorded based upon the original terms was 0.4 million and 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.8 million and 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans. Delinquent Loans . The following tables set forth our loan delinquencies, including nonaccrual loans, by type and amount at the dates indicated .

This decrease is primarily due to a 8.0 million, or 48 decrease of loans 30-59 days past due to 8.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 16.6 million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, loans 90 days or more past due increased 4.2 million, or 47 , which includes nonaccrual loans, from 9.0 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the change in nonperforming assets discussed in Nonperforming Assets above.

 Classified Loans. We categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate and other consumer loans, and non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans. This analysis is performed at least quarterly. The four risk categories utilized are Pass, Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Loans in the Pass category are considered of satisfactory quality, while the remaining three categories indicate varying levels of increasing credit risk. See Note 5 Loans Credit Quality to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information about our risk categories. Loans criticized as Special Mention or classified as Substandard or Doubtful were as follows at the dates indicated: 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Special Mention: Commercial real estate 10,335 21,516 Substandard: Residential real estate 13,214 8,973 Commercial real estate 21,802 18,678 Construction 5,203 8,776 Total Substandard 40,219 36,427 Total (1) 50,554 57,943 Total loans 1,223,737 1,348,972 Criticized and classified assets to total loans 4 4 

 (1) We did not have any loans classified as Doubtful at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Total Special Mention and Substandard loans were 50.6 million, or 4 of total gross loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 57.9 million, or 4 of total gross loans, at December 31, 2023. The decrease of 11.2 million in Special Mention loans was primarily attributable to loans that were upgraded from Special Mention to Pass totaling 12.9 million, as a result of five commercial real estate loans where the borrowers took actions to improve the debt service coverage ratios of their loans. Additionally, a loan in the amount of 4.4 million was downgraded from Special Mention to Substandard. In addition, 5.3 million of loans were downgraded from Pass to Special Mention, while 1.1 million of Substandard loans were upgraded to Special Mention. The increase of 3.8 million in Substandard loans was primarily attributable to loans downgraded to Substandard totaling 13.1 million which was partially offset by loans that were paid in full totaling 6.1 million, payments of loan principal totaling 0.8 million and loans that were upgraded from Substandard to Pass totaling 2.4 million. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance estimated at each condensed consolidated balance sheet date in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. When the Company deems all or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible the appropriate amount is written off and the allowance for credit losses is reduced by the same amount. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses when received. The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses on loans using a Probability of Default/Probability of Attrition model which incorporates probability of default, loss given default, exposure to default and probability of attrition attributes. The model considers relevant available information at both the portfolio and loan level from internal data that is supplemented by information sourced from a third party. The model also incorporates reasonable and supportable forecasts over an 8-quarter forecast period. We continued to consider the impact of inflation and the risk of a recession in our process for estimating expected credit losses along with the uncertainty related to the severity and duration of the economic consequences resulting from such events. Our methodology and framework include an 8-quarter forecast period and 2-quarter reversion period, which is the period where the macroeconomic variables are relaxed and revert to the average historical loss rates. 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 Also included in the allowance for credit losses on loans are qualitative amounts to cover risks that, in the Company s assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative analysis. Factors that the Company considers include, among other things, adjustments for imprecision inherent in the forecasts of macroeconomic variables, levels of criticized and classified loans and collection strategies management may employ to reduce these levels, portfolio dispersion and the unique characteristics of our Advantage Loan Program loans which could result in behavior different than our historic losses in a downside economic cycle. The following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

In addition, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 189 and 329 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses declined as a result of continued improvement in the credit quality of our commercial loan portfolio, which was somewhat mitigated by the increase in our nonperforming residential loans. Net charge off (recoveries) were (10) thousand and (1) thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net charge offs (recoveries) were (0.5) million and 6.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net charge offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects the 6.5 million in charge offs of our recorded investment on residential loans transferred to held for sale. The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses allocated by loan category at the dates indicated. The allowance for credit losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance for credit losses to absorb losses in other categories.

 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments to the allowance for credit losses may be necessary and our results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for credit losses in conformity with U.S. GAAP, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio, will not require us to increase our allowance for credit losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for credit losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate. Any material increase in the allowance for credit losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Collateral-Dependent Loans Collateral-dependent loans are those for which repayment (on the basis of the Company s assessment as of the reporting date) is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of collateral-dependent loans was 3.5 million and 4.0 million, respectively. These loans were collateralized by residential real estate property and the fair value of collateral on substantially all collateral-dependent loans were significantly in excess of their amortized cost basis loans. Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty Modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may include interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness, forbearances, term extensions, and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Historically, the Company has provided loan forbearances to residential borrowers when mandated and modified construction loans by providing term extensions. The Company did not have any loans held for investment made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were modified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company did not have any loans held for investment made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were previously modified that subsequently defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

We continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives and changing market conditions that could affect profitability and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities and change the composition of our investment securities portfolio. In this regard, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased Treasury and Agency securities of 104.6 million and collateralized mortgage obligations of 114.7 million to replace our maturing Treasury securities of 175.0 million to obtain higher rates of interest while still maintaining our targeted duration.

 For available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available for sale debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we evaluate at the individual security level whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. We review the debt securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine the cause and magnitude of declines in the fair value of each security. At September 30, 2024, gross unrealized losses on debt securities totaled 15.4 million. Our U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and the majority of the collateralized mortgage obligations are issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. The Company has a long history with no credit losses from issuers of U.S. government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. As a result, management does not expect any credit losses on its available for sale debt securities. Accordingly, we have not recorded an allowance for credit losses for our available for sale debt securities at September 30, 2024. Our equity securities consist of an investment in a qualified Community Reinvestment Act investment fund, which is a publicly-traded mutual fund, and an investment in the common equity of Pacific Coast Banker s Bank, a thinly traded restricted stock. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, equity securities totaled 4.8 million and 4.7 million, respectively. We are required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of our membership in the FHLB system. Our FHLB stock is considered a non-marketable equity security that is accounted for at cost, which equals its par value. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held 18.4 million and 18.9 million, respectively, in FHLB stock. We are also required to hold FRB stock as a condition of our membership in the Federal Reserve, which is required of us as a covered savings association. Our FRB stock is considered a non-marketable equity security that is accounted for at cost, which equals its par value. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held 9.2 million and 9.0 million, respectively, in FRB stock. Deposits Deposits are the primary source of funding for the Company. We regularly review the need to adjust our deposit offering rates on various deposit products in order to maintain a stable liquidity profile and a competitive cost of funds. We obtain funds from depositors by offering a range of deposit types, including demand, savings, money market and time. The following table sets forth the composition of our deposits by account type at the dates indicated. 

At September 30, At December 31, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Noninterest-bearing deposits 31,276 35,245 Money market, savings and NOW 1,063,746 1,095,521 Time deposits 972,171 873,220 Total deposits 2,067,193 2,003,986 Total deposits were 2.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 63.2 million from December 31, 2023. Our time deposits increased by 99.0 million, or 11 . Our money market, savings and NOW deposits decreased by 31.8 million, or 3 , and our noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased 4.0 million, or 11 , from December 31, 2023. We did not have any brokered deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our current strategy is to continue to offer competitive interest rates on our deposit products to maintain our existing customer deposit base and maintain our liquidity. Our estimated uninsured deposits were 461.1 million, or approximately 22 of total deposits, and 434.4 million, or 22 of total deposits, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank s regulatory reporting requirements.

 The portion of U.S. time deposit accounts that exceeded the FDIC insurance limit of 250,000 was 108.0 million at September 30, 2024. Borrowings In addition to deposits, we use short-term borrowings, such as FHLB advances and drawdowns on an overdraft credit line with the FHLB, as sources of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of our customers. Our short-term advances with the FHLB consist primarily of advances of funds for one- or two-week periods. On May 15, 2024, the FHLB exercised its call right to require repayment of our long-term fixed rate FHLB advance of 50.0 million with an original maturity date of May 2029. We repaid the FHLB advance with our existing cash funds. The FHLB advance required monthly interest-only payments at 1.96 per annum. At September 30, 2024, we had a borrowing capacity of 409.3 million from the FHLB, which included an available line of credit of 20.0 million. We also have available credit lines with other banks totaling 60.0 million. There were no borrowings outstanding on the lines of credit with other banks. Shareholders Equity Total shareholders equity was 334.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 327.7 million at December 31, 2023. Analysis of Results of Operations General. The Company had a net loss of (0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income was 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.4 million from 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates. The following table sets forth the average balance sheet, interest income or interest expense, average yields earned and interest rates paid for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin on average interest-earning assets. The average balances are daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and nonperforming balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.

 The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. The table distinguishes between: (1) changes attributable to volume (changes in volume multiplied by the prior period s rate), (2) changes attributable to rate (change in rate multiplied by the prior period s volume) and (3) total increase (decrease) (the sum of the previous columns). Changes attributable to both volume and rate are allocated ratably between the volume and rate categories.

Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned or paid. Our net interest income is significantly impacted by changes in interest rates and market yield curves and their related impact on cash flows. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net interest income was 13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.4 million, or 15 , from 16.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income reflects the impact of interest expense, primarily on interest-bearing deposits, increasing more than interest income on interest-earning assets during the higher interest rate environment. The prevailing interest rate environment combined with significant competition for deposits resulted in significant disparity between the impact on interest expense compared to interest income. In addition, the decline in net interest income partially reflects the continued reduction in the average balance of our residential mortgage loan portfolio.

Table of Contents 
 Interest income was 34.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.5 million, or 4 , from 32.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily due to the yield earned on the average balance of our interest-earning assets. The yield on the average balance of our loan portfolio increased 60 basis points primarily due to an 85 basis point increase in the yield on our residential real estate loans as the portfolio repriced higher in the higher interest rate environment. The yield on the average balance of our securities increased 106 basis points primarily due to the yield on our recently purchased securities being higher than the yield on the average balance of our securities for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Also contributing to the increase in interest income, the average balance of our securities portfolio of 476.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 75.7 million, or 19 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the average balance of our other interest-earning assets, which predominately consists of cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank which earns interest at the federal funds rate less 10 basis points, of 650.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 60.8 million, or 10 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting the increase in interest income was the decline in interest income earned on our loans since the average balance of our loans decreased 204.1 million, or 14 . Interest expense was 20.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.9 million, or 23 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023. Similar to our interest-earning assets, the increase in our interest expense was primarily driven by the change in interest rates. The rate paid on the average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased 84 basis points. We continued to competitively price our deposits in the higher interest rate environment and as competition for deposits significantly increased. Net interest margin was 2.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down 32 basis points from 2.62 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The interest rate spread was 1.71 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down 44 basis points from 2.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin and interest rate spread were negatively impacted during the three months ended September 30, 2024 by higher interest rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits than in the comparable period in 2023, which outpaced the increase in the yield we earned on our interest-earning assets over the same period. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net interest income was 42.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.9 million, or 14 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income primarily reflects interest expense on our interest-bearing deposits increasing more than interest income during this high interest rate environment. Interest income was 101.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.6 million, or 8 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 58 basis point increase in the yield earned on the average balance of our total interest-earning assets with the rates on residential real estate loans, securities and other interest-earning assets increasing 99 basis points, 110 basis points and 33 basis points, respectively, as these portfolios repriced upward significantly in the higher interest rate environment. Also contributing to the increase in interest income, the average balance of our securities portfolio of 459.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 78.7 million, or 21 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the average balance of our other interest-earning assets of 623.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 108.7 million, or 21 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting the increase in interest income was the decline in interest income earned on our loans since the average balance of our loans decreased 255.0 million, or 17 . Interest expense was 58.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 44.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Similar to our interest-bearing assets, the increase in our interest expense was primarily driven by the change in interest rates. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits of 120 basis points from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Specifically, the average rate paid on money market, savings and NOW accounts, and time deposits increased 112 basis points and 131 basis points, respectively, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as we continued to competitively price our deposits. Interest expense for the nine ended September 30, 2024 also reflected the elimination of interest expense from our Subordinated Notes, which were redeemed in the third quarter of 2023 and totaled 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin was 2.42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 31 basis points from 2.73 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The interest rate spread was 1.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 44 basis points from 2.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses . The following table presents the components of our provision for credit losses: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) Provision for (recovery of) credit losses: Loans (2,596) (1,887) (4,884) (3,917) Off-balance sheet credit exposures 258 (55) 508 (253) Total (2,338) (1,942) (4,376) (4,170) Our provision for (recovery of) credit losses was (2.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (1.9) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our provision for (recovery of) credit losses was (4.4) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (4.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The recovery of credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the reduction in the commercial real estate portfolio s allowance for credit losses reflecting the continued strong credit quality of the portfolio. In addition, the residential mortgage portfolio s allowance for credit losses declined primarily due to continued reduction in the aggregate principal balance of this portfolio while taking into account the increase in nonperforming residential mortgage loans. The recovery of credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the reduction in the commercial real estate portfolio previously discussed as well as a reduction in the allowance for credit losses on our residential loans due to a decline in this portfolio, lower future loss rates on one of our residential loan products and changing economic forecasts used in the model assumptions. Partially offsetting this recovery, we increased the provision for our unfunded commitments. The recovery for credit losses for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflected the improvement in our overall credit quality, along with the continued reduction of the residential loan portfolio. These factors were offset in part by the increase in substandard commercial real estate loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting overall weakness in the commercial real estate market due to the substantial increase in market interest rates and the potential impact on borrowers ability to make scheduled loan payments as these loans reprice or mature. Non-interest Income. The components of non-interest income were as follows: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Change September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent 2024 2023 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Service charges and fees 69 97 (28) (29) 248 269 (21) (8) Loss on the sale of investment securities N/M (2) 2 100 Gain on sale of loans held for sale N/M 1,695 (1,695) (100) Unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities 160 (137) 297 N/M 94 (137) 231 N/M Net servicing income 61 107 (46) (43) 182 268 (86) (32) Income earned on company owned life insurance 84 83 1 1 251 244 7 3 Other 5 234 (229) (98) 215 236 (21) (9) Total non interest income 379 384 (5) (1) 990 2,573 (1,583) (62) 

 N/M - not meaningful Non-interest income was 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The fair value of an equity security improved 0.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a decline of 0.1 million in the same period in the prior year. The three months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain on the extinguishment of our Subordinated Notes of 0.2 million which was recorded in other non-interest income. Non-interest income was 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.6 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 1.7 million gain recognized on the sale of loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Professional fees were 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.2 million, or 29 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Professional fees decreased as the government investigations against the Company and Bank have been resolved despite increased expenses related to the pending Transaction. The Company expects to incur significant expenses for professional fees through the closing of the Transaction. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 0.2 million, or 2 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to planned staff reductions in various support functions. Other non-interest expenses decreased 0.5 million or 32 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower insurance expense and advertising expenditures in 2024. Non-interest expense of 45.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflected a decrease of 7.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee benefits and professional fees. Professional fees were 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Professional fees decreased substantially as the government investigations against the Company and Bank have been resolved which was partially offset by increased expenses related to the pending Transaction. The Company expects to incur significant expenses for professional fees through the closing of the Transaction. In addition, professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was favorably impacted by reimbursements received from an insurance carrier of 2.2 million in the first quarter of 2023 for previously incurred legal fees, including advancement of legal expenses of third parties related to the government investigations. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to staff reductions in various support functions. Also favorably impacting the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a reversal of a liability in defered compensation no longer due to a former executive. Other non-interest expenses decreased 0.8 million or 16 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower advertising expenditures in 2024. Income Tax Expense. We recorded an income tax expense of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income tax expense of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded an income tax expense of 1.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 59.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income tax expense of 1.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 36.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes an additional 0.6 million of income tax expense to reverse a tax position previously taken on the deductibility of interest earned on U.S. government obligations under applicable state tax law. Our effective tax rate varies from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the additional income tax expense recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as previously discussed as well as the impact of non-deductible compensation-related expenses.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations when they come due. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans to ensure we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. Our primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, deposits, principal repayments on loans and maturities and principal receipts on our available for sale debt securities. Additional liquidity is provided by our ability to borrow from the FHLB, our ability to sell portions of our loan portfolio and access to the discount window of the Federal Reserve and brokered deposits. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and due from banks and interest-bearing time deposits with other banks. These funds offer substantial resources to meet either new loan demand or to help offset reductions in our deposit funding base. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and due from banks totaled 710.4 million and 578.0 million, respectively. Interest-bearing time deposits with other banks totaled 5.0 million and 5.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans and investment securities to access secured borrowings from the FHLB. Our available for sale debt securities totaled 436.4 million and 419.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased Treasury and Agency securities of 104.6 million and collateralized mortgage obligations of 114.7 million to replace our maturing Treasury securities of 175.0 million. We regularly review the need to adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. The Company s Asset Liability Management Committee monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change. Excess liquid assets are generally invested in interest-earning deposits and short-term securities. On May 15, 2024, the FHLB exercised its call right to require repayment of the Company s long-term fixed rate FHLB advance of 50.0 million with an original maturity date of May 2029. We repaid the FHLB advance with our existing cash funds. The FHLB advance required monthly interest-only payments at 1.96 per annum. Based on our collateral pledged to the FHLB, consisting of certain loans and investment securities, and holdings of FHLB stock, the Company had a borrowing capacity with the FHLB of 409.3 million at September 30, 2024. We also have available credit lines with other banks totaling 60.0 million. Cash flows from investing activities are primarily impacted by our loan and investment securities activity, as discussed above. The Company s goal is to obtain as much of its funding for loans held for investment and other earning assets as possible from customer deposits. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we originated loans with an aggregate principal balance of 125.0 million and 44.4 million, respectively. Cash flows provided by loan payoffs totaled 175.6 million and 186.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. From time to time, we also sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to third party investors. Often, the agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans may contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. The Company has outstanding commitments to repurchase pools of Advantage Loan Program loans sold with an unpaid principal balance of 13.2 million at September 30, 2024. These commitments expire in July 2025. We also have outstanding 11.1 million of Advantage Loan Program loans that could be subject to repurchase at the demand of the investors. In addition, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans, other than Advantage Loan Program loans, sold in the secondary market that were subject to potential repurchase obligations in the event of breach of representations and warranties totaled 4.7 million at September 30, 2024. Should additional secondary market investors require us to repurchase a substantial portion of such outstanding loans subject to potential purchase, the cash required to fund these purchases will reduce our liquidity.

 Cash flows from financing activities are primarily impacted by our deposits. Our total deposits were 2.1 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 63.2 million, from December 31, 2023. We generate deposits from local businesses and individuals through customer referrals and other relationships and through our retail presence. We obtain funds from depositors by offering a range of deposit types, including demand, savings, money market and time. We utilize borrowings and brokered deposits to supplement funding needs and manage our liquidity position though we have not used brokered deposits during the past four years. At September 30, 2024, time deposits due within one year were 903.8 million, or 44 of total deposits. At December 31, 2023, time deposits due within one year were 761.7 million, or 38 of total deposits. In addition, we estimated our total uninsured deposits were approximately 22 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. Also, cash flows from financing activities included the repayment of a FHLB advance of 50 million in May 2024 as discussed above. We are a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit that are not reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, as well as commitments on unused lines of credit that involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. At September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments to extend credit totaling 25.3 million and standby letters of credit outstanding of 24 thousand. The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank, and, on a parent company-only basis, the Company s primary source of funding is dividends received from the Bank. Federal banking regulations limit the dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Regulatory approval is required if the Bank s total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the Bank s net income for that year to date plus the Bank s retained net income for the preceding two years, or the Bank would not be at least adequately capitalized under applicable regulations following the distribution. Federal banking regulations also limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends under other circumstances. After receipt of the OCC approval, the Bank paid a cash dividend of 3.0 million to the Company during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a unitary thrift holding company, such as the Bank, must still file a notice with the FRB at least 30 days before its board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. The Company has the legal ability to access the debt and equity capital markets for funding, although the Company currently is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB in order to issue debt. The Company s ability to pay cash dividends is restricted by the terms of the applicable provisions of Michigan law and the rules and regulations of the OCC and the FRB. In addition, under Michigan law, the Company is prohibited from paying cash dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend, (i) it would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders with preferential rights on dissolution that are superior to those receiving the dividend, and we are currently required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB in order to pay any dividends to our shareholders. The Company and the Bank are subject to minimum capital adequacy requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. We manage our capital to comply with our internal planning targets and regulatory capital standards administered by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. We review capital levels on a quarterly basis. At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital requirements to which they were subject. The Company and Bank satisfied the requirements of the CBLR framework with leverage capital ratios of 14.18 and 13.72 , respectively, compared to the requirement for these ratios to be greater than 9 , and therefore are considered to have met the minimum capital requirements to be well capitalized under applicable prompt corrective action requirements. For further information regarding our regulatory capital requirements, refer to Note 12 Regulatory Capital Requirements to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements. The compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements is a tool used in assessing the Company s capital adequacy, but is not necessarily determinative of how the Company would fare under extreme stress. Factors that may affect the adequacy of the Company s capital include the inherent limitations of fair value estimates and the assumptions thereof, the inherent limitations of accounting classifications of certain investments and the effect on their measurement, external macroeconomic conditions and their effects on capital and the Company s ability to raise capital or refinance capital commitments, and extent of steps taken by state or federal governmental authorities in periods of extreme stress.

 As a result of the Company s guilty plea and criminal conviction in July 2023 pursuant to our Plea Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, we fall within the bad actor disqualification provisions of Regulation A and Regulation D under the Securities Act. These provisions prohibit an issuer from offering or selling securities in a private placement in reliance on Regulation A for certain small offerings and Regulation D for certain private placement transactions for a period of up to five years under certain circumstances. The SEC may waive such disqualification upon a showing of good cause that disqualification is not necessary under the circumstances for which the safe harbor exemptions are being denied. Absent a waiver, we will be restricted in our ability to raise capital in a private placement in reliance on the safe harbors provided by Regulation A or Regulation D. We have submitted to the SEC a waiver request from the bad actor disqualifications. If the SEC were to deny our waiver request, we will be limited in our ability to raise capital through a private placement under Regulation A or Regulation D, although we would remain eligible as an SEC registrant to access the equity capital markets through an SEC-registered offering or through another exemption from the registration requirements. Recently Issued Accounting Guidance See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting guidance and related impact on our financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK General . The principal objective of our asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk within the balance sheet and pursue a controlled assumption of interest rate risk while maximizing net income and preserving adequate levels of liquidity and capital. The Asset Liability Committee of our board of directors serves as oversight of our asset and liability management function, which is implemented and managed by our Management Asset Liability Committee. Our Management Asset Liability Committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to product offering rate changes, local and national market conditions and market interest rates. That group also reviews our liquidity, capital, deposit mix, loan mix and investment positions. We manage our exposure to interest rates primarily by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business based on a risk management infrastructure approved by our board of directors that outlines reporting and measurement requirements. In particular, this infrastructure sets limits, calculated quarterly, for various interest rate-related metrics, our economic value of equity EVE and net interest income simulations involving parallel shifts in interest rate curves. Steepening and flattening yield curves and various prepayment and deposit duration assumptions are prepared at least annually. Our interest rate management policies also require periodic review and documentation of all key assumptions used, such as identifying appropriate interest rate scenarios, setting loan prepayment rates and deposit durations based on historical analysis. We do not typically enter into derivative contracts for the purpose of managing interest rate risk, but we may do so in the future. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. Net Interest Income Simulation. We use an interest rate risk simulation model to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet. Instantaneous parallel rate shift scenarios are modeled and utilized to evaluate risk and establish exposure limits for acceptable changes in net interest income. These scenarios, known as rate shocks, simulate an instantaneous change in interest rates on a static balance sheet and use various assumptions, including, but not limited to, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates and pricing decisions on loans and deposits. Because these scenarios simulate instantaneous changes in interest rates on a static balance sheet that are subject to various assumptions, the scenarios below may not fully reflect our exposure to interest rate risk. For example, in the event of a significant decrease of the target federal funds rate by the Federal Open Market Committee we may not be able to lower our deposit rates at a similar pace in order to avoid significant deposit withdrawals as customers seek the highest yield possible for their funds. A significant, rapid decrease in interest rates could affect (i) the demand of our deposit products; (ii) our liquidity position if our depositors were to withdraw and move their funds to competing financial institutions; (iii) the expected yield of our loan portfolio and debt securities; (iv) the average duration of our loan portfolio and debt securities; (v) the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities; and (vi) our balance sheet mix and composition. In addition, the lack of robust loan originations will inhibit our ability to reinvest loan prepayments that occur as interest rates decline in interest earning assets at the higher end of the yield curve, thus either narrowing our interest rate spread and net interest margin or resulting in further significant decline in the size of our condensed consolidated balance sheet.

 The following table presents the estimated changes in net interest income of the Bank, calculated on a bank-only basis, which would result from changes in market interest rates over a 12-month period beginning September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The table below demonstrates that we are asset sensitive at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The base net interest income decreased primarily due to the asset mix of the balance sheet with the reduction of our loan portfolio, which was replaced with lower yielding cash. Sensitivity to rising interest rates increased as a result of the repricing of our residential loan and fixed-rate Treasury portfolios, and sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased due to the growth of our short-term time deposits. 

At September 30, At December 31, 2024 2023 Estimated Estimated 12-Months 12-Months Net Interest Net Interest Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) Income Change Income Change (Dollars in thousands) 200 63,915 8 62,356 1 100 61,926 4 62,560 1 0 59,411 61,652 100 57,908 (3) 60,057 (3) 200 56,863 (4) 57,636 (7) Economic Value of Equity Simulation. We also analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through an EVE model. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology. We estimate what our EVE would be as of a specific date. We then calculate what EVE would be as of the same date throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent parallel shifts in the yield curves. As described above, due to the nature of the EVE model and its underlying assumptions, the scenarios below may not fully reflect our exposure to interest rate risk. See Net Interest Income Simulation above for further discussion regarding how our exposure to interest rate risk may change, particularly upon a significant, rapid decrease in interest rates. The following table presents, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the impacts of immediate and permanent parallel hypothetical changes in market interest rates on EVE of the Bank, calculated on a bank-only basis. The base EVE increased from December 31, 2023 primarily from Residential loan valuation improvements related to the lower yield curve. The balance sheet was less sensitive to rising interest rates at September 30, 2024 due primarily to curve-related effects on residential loan values. Since EVE is a long-term measurement of value, the change in EVE is not indicative of the short term (12-months) effects on earnings.

 As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables. Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations. Actual results may be significantly different than our projections due to several factors, including the timing and frequency of rate changes, market conditions and the shape of the yield curve. The computations of interest rate risk shown above do not include actions that our management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates, and actual results may also differ due to any actions taken in response to the changing rates. Accordingly, the data presented in the tables in this section should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates and the resulting EVE and net interest income estimates are not intended to represent and should not be construed to represent our estimate of the underlying EVE or forecast of net interest income. Furthermore, the EVE presented in the foregoing table is not intended to present the fair market value of the Company, nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to shareholders in the event of the liquidation of the Company. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on these evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is required to evaluate, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, any changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during each quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Except as set forth below, we are not aware of any material developments to our pending legal proceedings as disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, nor are we involved in any pending legal proceedings other than routine legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. We believe that such routine legal proceedings, in the aggregate, are not material to our financial condition and results of operations. Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B. and Sterling Bancorp, Inc. vs. Scott Seligman, et al. On October 7, 2022, the Company and the Bank commenced an action against the Bank s founder and controlling shareholder, Scott Seligman, and other nominal defendants, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan styled Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B. and Sterling Bancorp, Inc. vs. Scott Seligman, et al., No. 2:22-cv-12398-SFC-DRG (E.D. Mich.). On September 25, 2024, the Company and the Bank entered into a Settlement Agreement and General Release with Scott Seligman, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company and the Bank agreed to dismiss their action, and Scott Seligman agreed to irrevocably discharge and release the Company and the Bank from any and all claims and covenanted not to sue the Company or the Bank on any and all claims, including claims with respect to the Company s entrance into, approval and adoption of the Stock Purchase Agreement and Plan of Dissolution. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Except as described herein, there are no material changes from the risk factors as disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. Risks Related to the Transaction The announcement and pendency of the Transaction may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Uncertainty about the effect of the Transaction on our associates, clients, and other parties may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations regardless of whether the Transaction is completed. These risks to our business include the following, among others, all of which may be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Transaction: (i) the impairment of our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our employees (ii) the diversion of significant management time and attention from ongoing business operations towards the completion of the Transaction (iii) difficulties maintaining relationships with clients, suppliers and other business partners (iv) delays or deferments of certain business decisions by our clients, suppliers and other business partners (v) the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to our business because the Transaction requires us to, subject to certain exceptions, conduct business in the ordinary course of business and to not engage in certain kinds of transactions prior to the completion of the Transaction without the prior written consent of EverBank, even if such actions could prove beneficial (vi) litigation relating to the Transaction and the costs and uncertainties related thereto and (vii) the incurrence of significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other Transaction costs in connection with the Transaction. Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated. The completion of the Transaction is conditioned on the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, the continuation of such regulatory approvals in full force and effect, the expiration of any applicable waiting periods relating to such regulatory approvals, and the absence of any material burdensome condition from such regulatory approvals. Even if the required regulatory approvals are received, the approvals may impose terms, conditions, limitations, obligations, or costs, may place restrictions on the conduct of our business or the conduct of EverBank s business after the closing, or may require changes to the terms of the Transaction. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such terms, conditions, limitations, obligations, restrictions or changes or that such terms, conditions, limitations, obligations, restrictions or changes will not have the effect of delaying the completion of the Transaction. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such terms, conditions, limitations, obligations, restrictions or changes will not result in the termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement and abandonment of the Transaction.

Table of Contents 
 The Federal Reserve and the OCC take into consideration a number of factors when reviewing bank merger and acquisition proposals under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Bank Merger Act, respectively. These factors include the effect of the transaction on competitiveness in affected banking markets, the financial and managerial resources of the companies and banks involved (including consideration of the capital adequacy, liquidity, and earnings performance, as well as the competence, experience and integrity of the officers, directors and principal shareholders, and the records of compliance with applicable laws and regulations) and future prospects of the combined organization. The Federal Reserve and the OCC also consider the effectiveness of the applicant in combatting money laundering, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, as well as the extent to which the proposal would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Neither the Federal Reserve nor the OCC may approve a proposal that would have significant adverse effects on competition or on the concentration of resources in any banking market. The Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms, and the Transaction may not be completed. The Stock Purchase Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Transaction. Those conditions include: (i) the approval of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Transaction and the Plan of Dissolution by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on such matters by holders of our common stock, (ii) the absence of any law, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling, injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or other order which has the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Transaction, and (iii) the receipt of the regulatory approvals with respect to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Transaction and the bank merger by the Federal Reserve and the OCC as described above. In addition, EverBank s obligation to complete the Transaction is also subject to the following conditions: (i) the sale by the Bank of its portfolio of residential tenant-in-common loans to Bayview and receipt by the Bank of the purchase price specified in such agreement and (ii) the average daily closing balance of the Bank s deposits for the monthly period ending on the last day of the month before closing is not less than 85 of the average daily closing balance of such deposits for the monthly period ending on July 31, 2024. Each party s obligation to complete the Transaction is also subject to certain additional conditions, including (a) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party and (b) performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement. These conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Transaction may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement at any time, before or after the shareholder approval. Also, either EverBank or we may elect unilaterally to terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement in certain circumstances. Failure to complete the Transaction could negatively impact us. If the Transaction is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our shareholders failing to approve the Transaction or as a result of the failure to obtain all needed regulatory approvals, there may be various adverse consequences and we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our clients and associates. For example, our business may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Transaction. Additionally, termination of the Transaction would likely have a negative effect on our market price. We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Transaction or to proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Transaction. If the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if the Company terminates the Stock Purchase Agreement to accept a superior proposal or if EverBank terminates the Stock Purchase Agreement after the board of directors changes its recommendation for shareholders to vote in favor of the Stock Purchase Agreement, we would be required to pay to EverBank a termination fee of up to 9,135,000. Additionally, we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of preparing, filing, printing, and mailing a proxy statement, and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the Transaction. If the Transaction is not completed, we would have to pay a large portion of these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Transaction.

 We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Transaction is pending. Uncertainty about the effect of the Transaction on associates and clients may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel pending completion of the Transaction, and could cause clients and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, we have agreed to operate our business in the ordinary course prior to the closing, and we are restricted from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of EverBank. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Transaction. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquiror that might be willing to pay more to acquire or merge with us. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to, among other things, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, inquiries or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to the exercise of fiduciary duties by our board of directors, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data relating to, any alternative acquisition proposals. These provisions, which include a termination fee of up to 9,135,000 payable by us under certain circumstances, might discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring the Company, the Bank or a significant part of the Bank s assets from considering or proposing that acquisition even if it were prepared to pay a consideration with a higher per share price to our shareholders than what is contemplated in the Transaction, or might result in a potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. Shareholder litigation could prevent or delay the completion of the Transaction or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations. One or more of our shareholders may file lawsuits against us and/or our directors and officers in connection with the Transaction. One of the conditions to the closing is the absence of any law, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling, injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or other order which has the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Transaction. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting us from completing the Transaction, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the Transaction and could result in significant costs to us, including any cost associated with the indemnification of our directors and officers. If a shareholder lawsuit is filed in connection with the Transaction, we may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of such lawsuit. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the completion of the Transaction. Risks Related to the Plan of Dissolution We cannot assure you as to the timing, amount, or number of distributions, if any, to be made to our shareholders. Our current intention is that, if our shareholders approve the Plan of Dissolution at the Special Meeting, the Company would file a certificate of dissolution with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs; however, the Company s board of directors would retain the discretion to determine not to proceed with the dissolution in its sole discretion and, if it does proceed with the dissolution, would have discretion as to the timing of the filing of the certificate of dissolution. No further shareholder approval would be required to effect the dissolution. However, if the board of directors determines prior to complete distribution of the Company s assets that the dissolution is not in the Company s best interest or in the best interest of our shareholders, the board of directors may, in its sole discretion, abandon the dissolution and terminate the Plan of Dissolution, subject to approval by the Company s shareholders. Revocation of the dissolution would require the board of directors to adopt a resolution revoking dissolution which would then require shareholder approval under Michigan law. Under the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the MBCA ), a dissolved corporation continues its existence after dissolution for such period as is necessary to complete the winding down of its affairs, including the payment of its debts, obligations and other liabilities and the distribution of its remaining assets to its shareholders. Any action, suit or proceeding begun by or against the corporation before or during the wind down period does not terminate by reason of the dissolution, and for the purpose of any such action, suit or proceeding, the corporation will continue beyond the dissolution until any related final judgments, orders or decrees are rendered, without the necessity for any special direction by the applicable court. A dissolved corporation must pay or make provision for the payment (or reservation of funds as security for payment) of its debts, obligations and liabilities and claims against the corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of the MBCA before the distribution of remaining assets to the corporation s shareholders.

 Any distribution to our shareholders will not occur until after the certificate of dissolution is filed, and we cannot predict with certainty the timing, amount, or number of any such distributions, or whether any such distributions will occur, as uncertainties as to the ultimate amount and scope of our liabilities, the operating costs and amounts to be set aside for claims, debts, obligations and provisions during the dissolution and wind down process, and the related timing to complete the wind down of our affairs, make it impossible to predict with certainty the actual net cash amount, if any, that will ultimately be available for distribution to shareholders or the timing of any such distributions. Among other things, our potential liabilities that may require provision could include those relating to indemnification obligations, if any, to third parties or to our current and former officers and directors, and to resolve any shareholder or other litigation that may emerge, even though none is now pending or to our knowledge threatened. Examples of uncertainties that could reduce the value of distributions to our shareholders include: the incurrence by the Company of expenses relating to the dissolution being different than estimated unanticipated costs relating to the defense, satisfaction or settlement of lawsuits or other claims that may be threatened against us or our current or former directors or officers amounts necessary to resolve claims of any creditors or other third parties and delays in the dissolution and wind down process. If it was determined by a court that we failed to make adequate provision for expenses, debts, obligations and liabilities or if the amount required to be paid in respect of such expenses, debts, obligations and liabilities exceeded the amount available from the reserve, a creditor could seek an injunction against the making of liquidating distributions under the Plan of Dissolution on the grounds that the amounts to be distributed were needed to provide for the payment of expenses and liabilities. Any such action could delay, substantially diminish or negate the cash distributions contemplated to be made to shareholders under the Plan of Dissolution. In addition, as we wind down, we will continue to incur expenses from operations, including directors and officers insurance, severance payments, payments to service providers and any continuing employees or consultants, taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees, costs associated with maintaining the listing of our common stock, and/or its delisting, and expenses related to our filing obligations with the SEC and/or others, which will reduce any amounts available for distribution to our shareholders. As a result, we cannot assure you as to the amounts, if any, that may ultimately be distributable or distributed to our shareholders if the Transaction is completed and the board of directors proceeds with the dissolution. If our shareholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution, we will not be able to proceed with the dissolution and no liquidating distributions will be made in connection therewith. It is the current intent of the board of directors, assuming approval of the dissolution and the Plan of Dissolution, that any cash will first be used to pay our outstanding current liabilities and obligations (including all transaction expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and consummation of the Stock Purchase Agreement and any claims or demands received by the Company on behalf of any of its shareholders), and then will be retained to pay ongoing corporate and administrative costs and expenses associated with winding down the Company, liabilities and potential liabilities relating to or arising out of any litigation matters and potential liabilities relating to our indemnification obligations, if any, to our service providers, or to our current and former officers and directors, before such cash, if any remains, will be available for distribution to shareholders. The board of directors will determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and number of the distributions of the remaining amounts, if any, to our shareholders in the dissolution. We can provide no assurance as to if or when any such distributions will be made, and we cannot provide any assurance as to the amounts, if any, that may ultimately be distributable or distributed to our shareholders in any such distributions, if any are to be made. Shareholders may receive substantially less than the amount that we currently estimate that they may receive, or they may receive no distribution at all. Our shareholders may be liable to third parties for part or all of the amount received from us in our liquidating distributions if cash reserves are inadequate. If the dissolution becomes effective, we are required to establish a cash reserve designed to satisfy any additional claims and obligations that may arise. Any reserve may not be adequate to cover all of our claims and obligations. Under the MBCA, in the event we fail to create an adequate reserve for the payment of expenses and liabilities and amounts have been distributed to the shareholders under the Plan of Dissolution, creditors may be able to pursue claims against shareholders directly to the extent that they have claims co-extensive with such shareholders receipt of liquidating distributions. Accordingly, in such event, a shareholder could be required to return part or all of the distributions previously made to such shareholder, and a shareholder could ultimately receive nothing from us under the Plan of Dissolution. Moreover, if a shareholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received, a repayment of all or a portion of such amount could result in a situation in which a shareholder may incur a net tax cost if the repayment of the amount previously distributed does not cause a commensurate reduction in taxes payable in an amount equal to the amount of the taxes paid on amounts previously distributed.

 Our shareholders of record will not be able to buy or sell shares of our common stock after we close our stock transfer books at the effective time of the dissolution. If the board of directors determines to proceed with the dissolution, we intend to close our stock transfer books and discontinue recording transfers of our common stock at the effective time of the dissolution. After we close our stock transfer books, we will not record any further transfers of our common stock on our books except at our sole discretion by will, intestate succession, or operation of law. Therefore, shares of our common stock will not be freely transferable after the effective time. As a result of the closing of the stock transfer books, all liquidating distributions in the dissolution will likely be made to the same shareholders of record as the shareholders of record as of the effective time. We plan to initiate steps to exit from certain reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, which may substantially reduce publicly available information about us. If the exit process is protracted, we will continue to bear the expense of being a public reporting company despite having no source of revenue. Our common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, which requires that we, and our officers and directors with respect to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, comply with certain public reporting and proxy statement requirements thereunder. Compliance with these requirements is costly and time consuming. We plan to initiate steps to exit from such reporting requirements in order to curtail expenses however, such process may be protracted and we may continue to be required to file Current Reports on Form 8-K to disclose material events, including those related to the dissolution, and other reports, including an Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, we may continue to incur expenses that will reduce any amount available for distribution, including expenses of complying with public company reporting requirements and paying our service providers, among others. If our reporting obligations cease, publicly available information about us will be substantially reduced. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to efficiently dissolve, delist, liquidate, and wind down. We intend to rely on a few individuals in key management roles and contractor support to dissolve, delist from Nasdaq, liquidate our remaining assets, and wind down operations. Loss of one or more of these key individuals, or inability to contract with essential personnel, could hamper the efficiency or effectiveness of these processes, and may substantially increase the cost of the dissolution as we may need to rely on the services of third party restructuring and consulting firms to assist with the wind down and dissolution. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer Withholding of Vested Restricted Stock Awards During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company withheld shares of common stock representing a portion of the restricted stock awards that vested during the period under our employee stock benefit plans in order to pay employee tax liabilities associated with such vesting. These withheld shares are treated the same as repurchased shares for accounting purposes. The following table provides certain information with respect to our purchases of shares of the Company s common stock, as of the settlement date, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, all of which represent tax withholding of restricted stock awards: 

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Total Number of Approximate Dollar Shares Purchased as Value of Shares that Total Number Average Part of Publicly May Yet Be Purchased of Shares Price Paid Announced Plans or Under the Period Purchased (1) per Share Programs Plans or Programs (2) July 1 - 31, 2024 43,883 5.23 19,568,117 August 1 - 31, 2024 19,568,117 September 1 - 30, 2024 383 5.75 19,568,117 Total 44,266 5.23 

 (1) These shares were acquired from employees to satisfy income tax withholding requirements in connection with vesting share awards during the three months ended September 30, 2024. (2) In 2018, the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to 50 million of its outstanding stock. At September 30, 2024, 19.6 million remains of the 50 million authorized repurchase amount. In March 2020, the Company suspended the stock repurchase program. 
 We are currently required to obtain approval of the FRB prior to engaging in a repurchase of our common stock other than a purchase of shares to satisfy income tax withholding requirements.

Exhibit 10.4 CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT This CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT (the Agreement is made and entered into as of June 21, 2023 between Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B. (the Bank and Eleni Willis (the Officer ). INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT The Officer is an employee of the Bank, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sterling Bancorp, Inc. (the Company ). The Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank have concluded that it is in the best interests of the Company, the Bank and their shareholders to establish a working environment for the Officer which minimizes the personal distractions that might result from possible changes in control in which the Company or the Bank might be involved. The Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank have concluded that it is in the best interests of the Bank and the Company to provide the Officer with assurance that he or she will receive payment equal to one year s salary if his or her employment is terminated for certain specified reasons within one (1) year after a Change of Control or Pending Change of Control as defined herein on the terms set forth herein. The terms and conditions which the Bank and the Officer have agreed to are as follows. AGREEMENT Section 1. Term; Change of Control and Pending Change of Control Defined . (a) This Agreement shall be in effect during the period (the Term beginning on the date first above written (the Effective Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Effective Date or, if earlier, the first anniversary of the Change of Control as defined below. (b) A Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following events: (i) the consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company with one or more other persons, other than a transaction following which: (A) at least 51 of the equity ownership interests of the entity resulting from such transaction are beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act in substantially the same relative proportions by persons who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51 of the outstanding equity ownership interests in the Company; and 

(B) at least 51 of the securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the entity resulting from such transaction are beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) in substantially the same relative proportions by persons who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51 of the securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company; (ii) the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 25 or more of the outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors by any person or by any persons acting in concert; (iii) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or (iv) any event which would be described in sections (i), (ii) or (iii) if the term Bank were substituted for the term Company therein. In no event, however, shall a Change of Control be deemed to have occurred as a result of any acquisition of securities or assets of the Company, the Bank, or a subsidiary of either of them, by the Company, the Bank, or any subsidiary of either of them, or by any employee benefit plan maintained by any of them, or as a result of any recapitalization or other stock issuance initiated by the Company or the Bank. For purposes of this section 1(b), the term person shall have the meaning assigned to it under sections 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act. (c) For purposes of this Agreement, a Pending Change of Control shall mean: (i) the signing of a definitive agreement for a transaction which, if consummated, would result in a Change of Control; or (ii) the commencement of a tender offer which, if successful, would result in a Change of Control. In the event that such transaction or tender offer which constituted a Pending Change of Control is terminated before a Change of Control occurs, the Pending Change of Control shall be treated as if it had not occurred following such termination. Section 2. Discharge Prior to a Pending Change of Control . The Bank or the Company may discharge the Officer at any time prior to the occurrence of a Pending Change of Control for any reason or for no reason. In such event: (a) The Bank shall pay to the Officer (or, in the event of the Officer s death before payment, the Officer s estate) the Officer s earned but unpaid compensation (including, without limitation, salary and all other items which constitute wages under applicable law) as of the date of the Officer s termination of employment. This payment shall be made at the time and 
 Page 2 of 15 

in the manner prescribed by law applicable to the payment of wages but in no event later than 30 days after the date of the Officer s termination of employment. (b) The Bank shall provide the benefits, if any, due to the Officer, the Officer s estate, surviving dependents or designated beneficiaries under the employee benefit plans and programs and compensation plans and programs maintained for the benefit of the officers and employees of the Bank, including the annual and long-term bonuses (if any) to which the Officer is entitled under any cash-based annual bonus or performance compensation plan in effect for the year in which his or her termination occurs, to be paid at the same time and on the terms and conditions (including but not limited to achievement of performance goals) applicable under the relevant plan. The time and manner of payment or other delivery of these benefits and the recipients of such benefits shall be determined according to the terms and conditions of the applicable plans and programs. The Bank shall also provide any continuation rights required by Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985 COBRA or similar state law, at the expense of the Officer. The payments and benefits described in sections 2 (a) and (b) shall be referred to in this Agreement as the Standard Termination Entitlements. Section 3. Termination of Employment Due to Death . The Officer s employment with the Bank shall terminate, automatically and without any further action on the part of any party to this Agreement, on the date of the Officer s death. In such event, the Bank shall pay and deliver to the Officer s estate and surviving dependents and beneficiaries, as applicable, the Standard Termination Entitlements. Section 4. Termination Due to Disability after a Pending Change of Control. The Bank or the Company may terminate the Officer s employment during the Term and after the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Pending Change of Control upon a determination, by vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Bank or the Company, acting in reliance on the written advice of a medical professional acceptable to them and reasonably acceptable to Officer or his or her guardian, that the Officer is suffering from a Disability, which shall mean a physical or mental impairment which, at the date of the determination, has prevented the Officer from performing his or her assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least sixty (60) days during the period of six (6) months ending with the date of the determination or is likely to result in death or prevent the Officer from performing his or her assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least sixty (60) days during the period of six (6) months beginning with the date of the determination. As a condition to any benefits, the Board of Directors may require the Officer to submit to such physical or mental evaluations and tests as it deems reasonably appropriate. In such event: 
 Page 3 of 15 

(a) The Bank shall pay and deliver to the Officer (or in the event of his or her death before payment, to the Officer s estate and surviving dependents and beneficiaries, as applicable) the Standard Termination Entitlements. (b) In addition to the Standard Termination Entitlements, in the event that the Officer s employment terminates during the Term and after the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Pending Change of Control, the Bank shall continue to pay the Officer his or her base salary, at the annual rate in effect for him or her immediately prior to the termination of his or her employment, during a period ending on the earliest of: (i) the expiration of one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of termination of his or her employment; (ii) the date on which long-term disability insurance benefits are first payable to him or her under any long-term disability insurance plan covering employees of the Bank; and (iii) the date of his or her death. Section 5. Discharge with Cause after a Pending Change of Control. (a) The Bank or the Company may terminate the Officer s employment with Cause during the Term and after the occurrence of a Change of Control or Pending Change of Control, but a termination shall be deemed to have occurred with Cause only if the Officer: (i) has willfully failed or refused to perform his or her assigned duties in any material respect (including, for these purposes, the Officer s inability to perform such duties as a result of drug or alcohol dependency); (ii) has committed gross negligence in the performance of, or is guilty of continual neglect of, his or her assigned duties; (iii) has been convicted or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, the commission of a felony or any other crime involving dishonesty, personal profit or other circumstance likely, in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the Bank, to have a material adverse effect on the Bank and the Company or their business, operations or reputation taken as a whole; (iv) has willfully violated, in any material respect, any law, rule, regulation, written agreement or final cease-and-desist order applicable to the Bank or the Company in his or her performance of services for the Bank or the Company or the Company s or the Bank s code of conduct; or (v) has willfully and intentionally breached the material terms of this Agreement in any material respect. For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act on the part of Officer shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Officer in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Officer s action or omission was in the best interests of the Bank and the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Bank or the Executive Committee of either board or based upon the written advice of counsel for the Bank shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by Officer in good faith and in the best interests of the Bank and the Company. Any such determination must be made by a majority vote of the entire membership of the Board of Directors of the Bank at a meeting of the Board of Directors called and held for that purpose, finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, the Officer s conduct satisfies the requirements for termination for Cause. Termination for Cause shall be effected by written Notice of Termination (as described below) to the Officer setting forth with particularity the grounds for termination. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, 
 Page 4 of 15 

other than with respect to earned but unpaid salary and such other vested benefits as are set forth in this Agreement and in any other agreement or plan, the Officer shall not have the right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, a Notice of Termination shall mean a written notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon to provide a basis for termination of Officer s employment. (b) In the event the Officer s employment is terminated with Cause, as provided in this Section 5, the Bank shall pay and deliver to the Officer the Standard Termination Entitlements. Section 6. Discharge without Cause . The Bank or the Company may discharge the Officer without Cause at any time after the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Pending Change of Control, and in such event: (a) The Bank shall pay and deliver to the Officer (or in the event of the Officer s death before payment, to the Officer s estate and surviving dependents and beneficiaries, as applicable) the Standard Termination Entitlements. (b) In addition to the Standard Termination Entitlements, in the event of a discharge of the Officer without Cause after the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Pending Change of Control and during the Term, the Bank shall pay to the Officer (or in the event of death before payment, to the Officer s estate) an amount equal to 12 months base salary, which will be paid in a lump sum on the sixtieth (60 th day after termination of employment if the requirements of section 8(b) are met. In the event that such discharge occurs later than one year after the Change of Control, no additional amounts will be paid. (c) The payment described in section 6(b) is referred to in this Agreement as the Additional Termination Entitlements . Section 7. Resignation . (a) The Officer may resign from his or her employment with the Bank at any time. A resignation under this section 7 shall be effected by notice of resignation given by the Officer to the Bank and shall take effect on the later of the effective date of termination specified in such notice or the date on which the notice of termination is deemed given to the Bank. The Officer s resignation of any of the positions within the Bank or the Company to which he or she has been assigned shall be deemed a resignation from all such positions. (b) With respect to termination of the Officer s employment, Good Reason shall be considered to exist upon the occurrence of any of the following events without the Officer s consent: 
 Page 5 of 15 

(i) the assignment to duties materially inconsistent with the Officer s position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control; (ii) a material diminution in the authorities, duties or responsibilities of the person to whom the Officer is required to report; (iii) a material reduction in the Officer s annual base salary; (iv) the Company s or the Bank s requiring the Officer to be based at any office or location resulting in a material increase in the Officer s commute to and from the Officer s primary residence in or near Southfield, Michigan (for this purpose an increase in the Officer s commute by 50 miles or more shall be deemed material); or (v) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Bank of this Agreement; provided that, within ninety (90) days after the initial existence of such event, the Bank shall be given notice and an opportunity, of not less than thirty (30) days, to remedy in good faith the condition constituting such Good Reason as asserted by the Officer. The Officer s employment shall continue in effect during such time so long as the Bank or the Company make diligent efforts during such time to cure the asserted Good Reason event or condition. In the event that the Bank or the Company shall remedy in good faith the event or condition constituting Good Reason, then the Officer s notice of termination for Good Reason shall be null and void, and, as a result of such event, the Officer shall not be entitled to resign with Good Reason. The Bank s or the Company s remedy of any Good Reason event or condition with or without notice from the Officer shall not relieve the Bank from any obligations to the Officer under this Agreement or otherwise and shall not affect the Officer s rights upon the reoccurrence of the same, or the occurrence of any other, Good Reason event or condition. The Officer s resignation hereunder for Good Reason shall not occur later than one hundred fifty (150) days following the initial date on which the event the Officer claims constitutes Good Reason occurred. In all other cases, a resignation by the Officer shall be deemed to be without Good Reason. In the event of resignation, the Officer shall state in his or her notice of resignation whether he or she considers his or her resignation to be a resignation with Good Reason, and if he or she does, he or she shall state in such notice the grounds which constitute Good Reason. The Officer s determination of the existence of Good Reason shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud, bad faith or manifest error. (c) In the event of the Officer s resignation for any reason, the Bank shall pay and deliver the Standard Termination Entitlements. In the event of the Officer s resignation with Good Reason after the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Pending Change of Control and 
 Page 6 of 15 

during the Term, the Bank shall also pay and deliver the Additional Termination Entitlements. In the event that such discharge occurs later than one year after the Change of Control, no Additional Termination Entitlements will be paid. Section 8. Terms and Conditions of the Additional Termination Entitlements . (a) The Bank and the Officer hereby stipulate that the damages which may be incurred by the Officer following any termination of employment are not capable of accurate measurement as of the date first above written and that the Additional Termination Entitlements constitute reasonable damages under the circumstances and shall be payable without any requirement of proof of actual damage and without regard to the Officer s efforts, if any, to mitigate damages. (b) The Bank and the Officer further agree that the Bank may condition the payment and delivery of the Additional Termination Entitlements on the receipt of: (i) the Officer s resignation from any and all positions which the Officer holds as an officer, director or committee member with respect to the Bank or the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of either of them; and (ii) a release of the Bank, the Company and their officers, directors, shareholders, subsidiaries and affiliates, in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank, of any liability to the Officer, whether for compensation or damages, in connection with his or her employment with the Bank or the Company and the termination of such employment except for the Standard Termination Entitlements and the Additional Termination Entitlements, that becomes effective on its terms, if at all, no later than the sixtieth (60th) day immediately following the Officer s termination of employment. Section 9. Post-Termination Obligations . The Officer shall, upon reasonable notice, furnish such information and assistance to the Bank as may reasonably be required by the Bank in connection with any litigation to which it or any of its affiliates is, or may become, a party, other than any litigation between the Officer and the Bank or its affiliates. The Bank shall reimburse the Officer for reasonable costs incurred by the Officer in providing such information and assistance. Section 10. Non- Disparagement; Non-Disclosure and Non-Compete . (a) The Officer shall not make any statements that disparage the Company, the Bank, or any subsidiary of such entities or the business practices of the Company, the Bank, or any subsidiary of such entities, except to the extent required (i) by law or by a court or other governmental agency of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) to exercise any legally protected whistleblower rights (including pursuant to Rule 21F under the Exchange Act.) The Company and the Bank shall not knowingly or intentionally make any statements that disparage the Officer, and the Company and the Bank shall each instruct its directors and officers not to make any statements that disparage the Officer. The provisions of this Section 10(a) shall survive the expiration of this Agreement. 
 Page 7 of 15 

(b) The Officer acknowledges that during his or her employment he or she will learn and have access to confidential information regarding the Company and the Bank and its customers and businesses Confidential Information ). The Officer agrees and covenants not to disclose or use for the Officer s own benefit, or the benefit of any other person or entity, any such Confidential Information, unless or until the Company or the Bank consents to such disclosure or use, or such information becomes common knowledge in the industry or is otherwise legally in the public domain.

The Officer understands and acknowledges that he or she will not be entitled to receive payments under the Sterling Bank Trust, FSB Severance Benefits Plan. Section 12. Successors and Assigns .

Failure of the Bank to obtain from any successor its express written assumption of the Bank s obligations hereunder at least 60 days in advance of the scheduled effective date of any such succession shall, if such succession constitutes a Change of Control, constitute Good Reason for the Officer s resignation on or at any time during the Term following the occurrence of such succession.

Section 21. Income Tax Withholding All payments required to be made by the Bank hereunder to the Officer shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Bank may reasonably determine should be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. Section 22. Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code . The Officer and the Bank acknowledge that each of the payments and benefits promised to the Officer under this Agreement must either comply with the requirements of Section 409A or qualify for an exception from compliance. To that end, the Officer and the Bank agree that: (a) the payment described in section 2(a) is intended to be excepted from compliance with Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(3) as payment made pursuant to the Bank s and the Bank s customary payment timing arrangement; and (b) the benefits and payments described in section 2(b) are expected to comply with or be excepted from compliance with Section 409A on their own terms. In the case of a payment that is not excepted from compliance with Section 409A, and that is not otherwise designated to be paid immediately upon a permissible payment event within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(a), the payment shall not be made prior to, and shall, if necessary, be deferred to and paid on the later of (i) the day five (5) days after the Officer s earliest separation from service (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h)) and, (ii) if the Officer is a specified employee (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i)) on the date of his or her separation from service, the earlier of the first day of the seventh month following the Officer s separation from service and the Officer s death.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any payment of compensation to or for the benefit of the Officer, whether or not made under the terms of this Agreement, either alone or together with any other payments and benefits which the Officer has received or has a right to receive, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the Code, such payments and/or benefits shall be reduced by the amount, if any, which is the minimum necessary to result in no portion of such payments or benefits being subject to the excise tax imposed under section 4999 of the Code. The amount of any required reduction shall be determined and applied in a manner calculated to maximize the after-tax value of the remaining payments and benefits. All calculations required to be made in order to determine whether 
 Page 13 of 15 

payments would be subject to the excise tax imposed under section 4999 of the Code, including the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination and the amount and application of any required reduction, shall be made by independent counsel retained by the Bank for this purpose prior to the event or the closing of the transaction which results in the application of section 4999 of the Code or such other independent counsel or independent firm of certified public accountants as the Bank may designate with the consent of the Officer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the Tax Advisor ), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Bank and the Officer within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of demand from the Officer, or such earlier time as is requested by the Bank. All fees and expenses of the Tax Advisor shall be borne solely by the Bank. Any determination by the Tax Advisor shall be binding upon the Bank and the Officer and all other interested parties in the absence of manifest error. Section 24. Recoupment of Payments . All payments and obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to the terms and conditions, if applicable, of any recoupment policy adopted by the Bank or the Company from time to time or any recoupment requirement imposed under applicable laws, rules or regulations, including but not limited to the Sterling Bancorp, Inc. Clawback Policy. In addition, the Officer covenants and agrees that the Company and the Bank and their successors and assigns shall have the right to demand the return of any golden parachute payments (as defined in FDIC regulation 12 C.F.R. Part 359) in the event that any of them obtain information indicating that the Officer committed, is substantially responsible for, or has violated, the respective acts or omissions, conditions, or offenses contained in FDIC regulation 12 C.F.R. 359.4(a)(4), and the Officer shall promptly return any such golden parachute payment upon such demand.
