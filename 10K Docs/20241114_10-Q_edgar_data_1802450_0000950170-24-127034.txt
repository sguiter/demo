 2023 Form 10-K means the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024; 
 Algorithm refers to a set of instructions that perform a particular action. Our team of data scientists and medical professionals create proprietary instruction sets, or Algorithms, to identify recovery opportunities within our Assignors data sets. Our proprietary Algorithms incorporate various data points within our Assignors data sets, which may include, but are not limited to, medical coding classification systems such as diagnosis codes (e.g., ICD-8/ICD-9/ICD-10 codes), procedure codes (e.g., CPT codes), and drug codes (e.g., NDC codes); non-medical data such as demographics and date ranges; and data from public sources such as crash reports, offense incident reports, and other reports that provide details as to an occurrence. These Algorithms are then applied to aggregated Assignor data sets, filtering through the billions of lines of data provided by our Assignors to identify recovery opportunities consistent with a given Algorithm s criteria. Identified potential recoveries are then further quality reviewed by our medical team; 
 Amended and Restated Bylaws means the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company; 
 Assignor means a healthcare payer, provider, or other entity that irrevocably assigned Claims to the Company or a subsidiary thereof; 
 ASC means Accounting Standards Codification;

The Billed Amount for a specific procedure code is based on the provider and may vary from location to location. Where a Billed Amount is not provided in the data received from the Assignor, the Company uses Paid Amount or paid adjusted values, where available, to extrapolate an approximate Billed Amount value. Where we have to extrapolate a Billed Amount to establish damages, the calculated amount may be contested by opposing parties. 
 Board of Directors or Board means the board of directors of the Company; 
 Business Combination means the transactions consummated on May 23, 2022, pursuant to the MIPA (as defined below), as described in more detail in Note 3, Business Combination , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report;

The term Claim typically includes but is not limited to: (i) claims arising under consumer protection statutes and laws; (ii) claims arising under the Medicare and Medicare Advantage secondary payer statutes, whether based in contract, tort, statutory right, or otherwise, in connection with the payment to provide healthcare services or supplies; (iii) claims arising under any state statutes and common laws, irrespective of the rights that are conferred to the Company through assignment or otherwise; and (iv) all right, title, and interest to any recovery rights that may exist for any potential cause of action where a responsible party or primary payer is liable, even where it has not been established because liability is not yet proven as of the date that the Claim is identified or discovered, together with all receivables, general intangibles, payment intangibles, and other rights to payment now existing or hereafter arising and all products and proceeds of the foregoing;

 Nomura Note refers to the promissory note issued to Nomura on May 27, 2022, as amended and restated from time to time; 
 Opco means Lionheart II Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; 
 Paid Amount (a/k/a Medicare Paid Rate or wholesale price) means the amount paid to the provider from the health plan or insurer. This amount varies based on the party making payment. For example, Medicare typically pays a lower fee for service rate than commercial insurers. The Paid Amount is derived from the Claims data we receive from our Assignors. In the limited instances where 
 2 

the data received lacks a paid value, our team calculates the Paid Amount with a formula. The formula used provides rates for outpatient services and is derived from the customary rate at the 95th percentile as it appears from standard industry commercial rates or, where that data is unavailable, the Billed Amount if present in the data. These amounts are then adjusted to account for the customary Medicare adjustment to arrive at the calculated Paid Amount. Management believes that this formula provides a conservative estimate for the Medicare paid amount rate, based on industry studies which show the range of differences between private insurers and Medicare rates for outpatient services. We periodically update this formula to enhance the calculated paid amount where that information is not provided in the data received from our Assignors. Management believes this measure provides a useful baseline for potential recoveries, but it is not a measure of the total amount that may be recovered in respect of potentially recoverable Claims, which in turn may be influenced by any applicable potential statutory recoveries such as double damages or fines, as described below. This calculation accounts for an approximate 6.86 increase in the total Paid Amount. Where we have to extrapolate a Paid Amount to establish damages, the calculated amount may be contested by opposing parties; 
 Palantir means Palantir Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation; 
 Public Warrants means warrants exercisable on a cashless basis only to purchase 1/25 of one share of Class A Common Stock (but only exercisable in lots of 25 to purchase whole shares), in accordance with its terms, as described in more detail in Note 3, Business Combination , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report; 
 PVPRC means the cumulative Paid Amount value of potentially recoverable Claims. We analyze our Claims portfolio and identify potentially recoverable Claims using Algorithms. PVPRC is a measure of the Paid Amount in respect of those potentially recoverable Claims. In the limited instances where the data received from our Assignors lacks a paid value, the adjustment formula described in the definition of Paid Amount is applied and increases PVPRC by approximately 6.33 ; 
 Recovery Proceeds means, with respect to any Claim, any and all gross proceeds recovered, including compensation, interest, penalties, and fees which may be paid or payable with respect to such Claim (including any and all cash, securities, instruments or other property which may be paid or issued by defendants or third parties in litigation proceedings in satisfaction of such Claim); 
 SEC means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission;

 VRM means Virage Recovery Master LP, a Delaware limited partnership and affiliate of Virage;

 The Initial Virage Warrant, as amended, was issued effective January 1, 2024 in an amount equal to the quotient of 1 of each calendar month end balance of the Unpaid Base Amount (calculated on a cumulative basis) and the VWAP of a share of Class A Common Stock for the five-day period prior to the issuance, beginning with May 24, 2023 and ending December 31, 2023, thus entitling Virage to purchase 28,298,329 shares of Class A Common Stock, with an expiration date of January 1, 2026. 
 The Monthly Virage Warrants may be issued each calendar month, beginning with January 31, 2024 until the obligations to Virage are paid in full, in an amount equal to the quotient of 1.0 of each calendar month-end balance (which month-end balance shall be increased daily up to 20 per annum based on a formula set forth in the Virage MTA Amendment) of the amount owing to Virage as of each preceding calendar month end and the VWAP of a share of our Class A Common Stock.

 million. The Company has the right to terminate the Yorkville SEPA at no cost or penalty upon five (5) trading days prior written notice to Yorkville, provided that there are no outstanding Advance Notices for which shares of common stock need to be issued and the Company has paid all amounts owed to Yorkville pursuant to the Convertible Notes.

The Company expects that any proceeds received from such sales to Yorkville will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Yorkville SEPA Embedded Derivative Certain features of the Yorkville SEPA have been identified and classified as an embedded derivative, which are classified as a liability in accordance with ASC 815 and valued in accordance with ASC 470, Debt.

The fair value of the combined embedded derivative was thousand as of September 30, 2024.

The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows since inception and has an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used approximately million of cash in operations. The Company s liquidity will depend on the ability to generate substantial revenue in the near future, the timing and amount of which is uncertain, as well as its ability to secure funding from additional third-party capital sources. The Company s principal liquidity needs have been working capital, debt service, and Claims financing obligations. The Company anticipates sources of liquidity to include the Working Capital Credit Facility and the Yorkville SEPA as disclosed in Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable , in the notes to the financial statements included within this Quarterly Report, and has taken several actions to address liquidity concerns, including the actions enumerated below. However, as discussed further below, the Company has concluded management s plans were not sufficient to alleviate the substantial doubt: 1. On March 29, 2023, the Company s subsidiary, Subrogation Holdings and its parent, MSP Recovery, entered into the Working Capital Credit Facility consisting of commitments to fund up to million in proceeds. Certain terms were amended to the Working Capital Credit Facility, which were memorialized in the Second Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement dated November 10, 2023. See summary in Hazel Working Capital Credit Facility and Hazel Purchase Money Loan in Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable . On August 2, 2024, HPH agreed to, among other things, (i) extend the period for the Company draw up to million for working capital, accessible in tranches of million, that can be drawn at least one month apart, until September 2025 and (ii) provide for a million loan to be funded by August 31, 2024 for the purpose of acquiring the New Claims . The parties memorialized this agreement in

 million of remaining capacity for working capital under the Operational Collection Floor as of the date of this filing. 

 2. On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into the MTA Amendment No. 2 and Amendment to the Amended and Restated Security Agreement Second Virage MTA Amendment ), which extended the due date for the payment obligations to Virage to December 31, 2024. See summary in Note 4, Asset Acquisitions . On April 1, 2024, the Company entered into the MTA Amendment No. 3 and Amendment No. 2 to the Amended and Restated Security Agreement Third Virage MTA Amendment ), which: (i) extended the VRM Full Return payment due date to September 30, 2025, subject to acceleration upon certain triggering events; (ii) the Company agreed that, after the Convertible Notes are fully satisfied, of the Company s portion of any net proceeds from the Yorkville SEPA would be used to pay down the VRM Full Return; and (iii) commence the sale of certain reserved shares of Messrs. John H. Ruiz and Frank C. Quesada, and the delivery of the resulting net cash proceeds thereof to VRM. The VRM Full Return guaranty obligation became current on September 30, 2024, and the Company does not currently have available liquidity to satisfy said obligation. 

 3. On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Nomura Note, which extended the maturity date of the Nomura Note to December 31, 2024. See summary in Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable . On March 26, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Nomura Note (defined in Note 3, Business Combination ), which extended the maturity date of the Nomura Note to . The note became current on September 30, 2024, and the Company does not currently have available liquidity to satisfy said obligation. 

 4. On November 14, 2023, the Company entered into the Yorkville SEPA, which included the issuance of Convertible Notes to Yorkville having aggregate principal amounts of up to million in connection with the purchase of Class A Common Stock. See summary in Committed Equity Facility within Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable . On April 8, 2024, the maturity date of the Convertible Notes was extended to . The Convertible Notes became current on September 30, 2024, and the Company does not currently have available liquidity to satisfy said obligations. 

 The Company has concluded that, despite the aforementioned financing arrangements, there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Unless we are successful in raising additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, we have concluded it is probable we will be unable to continue to operate as a going concern beyond the next twelve months. In the event that the Company receives an audit report from its independent registered public accounting firm with an emphasis of matter paragraph as to going concern in connection with the Company s audited annual financial statements, such event would result in an event of default in the aforementioned debt agreements, which would result in the debt becoming immediately due; however, the Company has received waivers from (i) Virage and VRM and (ii) HPH and Hazel if such an event were to occur for the year ending December 31, 2024.

, of the Company Class V Common Stock and non-voting economic Class B Units of Opco Class B Units, and each pair consisting of one share of Class V Common Stock and one Class B Unit, an Up-C Unit (such transaction, the Business Combination ). The Up-C Units are convertible into Class A Common Stock of the Company at the discretion of the holder of the Up-C Unit. Subsequent to the Closing Date, the Company s sole asset is its equity interest in MSP Recovery, LLC. The Company is the managing member and therefore consolidates Legacy MSP. As a result of the closing of the Business Combination (the Closing ), the Company is organized in an Up-C structure in which all of the business of Legacy MSP and its subsidiaries is held directly or indirectly by the Company, the Company is the managing member, consolidates Legacy MSP and the Company owns all of the voting economic Class A Units and the Members and their designees own all of the non-voting economic Class B Units in accordance with the terms of the first amended and restated limited liability company agreement of the Company. Each Up-C Unit may be exchanged for either, at the Company s option, (a) cash or (b) one share of Class A Common Stock, subject to the provisions set forth in the LLC Agreement. The aggregate consideration paid to the Members (or their designees) at the Closing consisted of: (i) Units and (ii) rights to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement TRA ). Of the Units, Units were issued in connection with the Closing and Units were designated to the Company and Opco for cancellation Canceled Units ). Since the Closing, the Company has issued Up-C Units to certain designated persons and intends to further issue shares of Class A Common Stock in respect of transaction-related bonuses or certain other designated persons, which together with the Up-C Units, would be equivalent in number to the Canceled Units. In connection with the Closing, the Company changed its name from Lionheart Acquisition Corporation II to MSP Recovery, Inc. The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, the Company is treated as the acquired for financial statement reporting purposes. The reverse recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of Legacy MSP issuing stock for the net assets of LCAP, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of LCAP are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The Company received net proceeds in the Business Combination transaction of approximately million. The Company incurred direct and incremental costs of approximately million related to the Business Combination, which consisted primarily of

 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Existing Warrant Agreement, and after giving effect to the issuance of the New Warrants, as defined below, the exercise price of the Public Warrants decreased to per share of Class A Common Stock. During the per iod from the Closing Date to September 30, 2024 , approximately million warrants of the original million warrants had been exercised. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of the remaining unexercised warrants decreased resulting in other income of thousand and thousand , respectively, which is recorded within change in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Following anti-dilution adjustments made in connection with the Business Combination, the Public Warrants have an exercise price of per share, which are exercisable on a cashless basis in lots of 25. Additionally, in connection with the Business Combination, the Company declared a dividend of approximately million New Warrants payable to the holders of record of the Class A Common Stock as of the close of business on the Closing Date, after giving effect to the waiver of the right, title, and interest in, to or under, participation in any such dividend by the Members, on behalf of themselves and any of their designees. The New Warrants are exercisable until their expiration date, which will be the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date or earlier redemption. The record date for the determination of the holders of record of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock entitled to receive the New Warrant Dividend was the close of business on the Closing Date. Pursuant to the terms of the LLC Agreement, at least twice a month, to the extent any New Warrants have been exercised in accordance with their terms, the Company is required to purchase from the MSP Principals, proportionately, the number of Up-C Units or shares of Class A Common Stock owned by such MSP Principal equal to the Aggregate Exercise Price divided by the Warrant Exercise price in exchange for the Aggregate Exercise Price. The Company determined that the New Warrants instruments meet the equity scope exception in ASC 815 to be classified in stockholders equity, and as the repurchase right noted above has a mirrored value designed to offset the New Warrants, if exercised would be an equity only transaction. The New Warrants are each exercisable in lots of 25 for one whole share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of per whole share. The New Warrants must be exercised in lots of 25, as no fractional shares will be issued as a result of their exercise. The New Warrants are subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. Public Warrants and New Warrants are currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbols LIFWZ and LIFWW, respectively. Tax Receivable Agreement In connection with the Business Combination, the Company also entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the TRA ). Pursuant to the TRA, the Company is required to pay the sellers of the amount of tax benefits that the Company actually realizes as a result of: (i) the Company s direct and indirect allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in the Business Combination, (ii) increases in the Company s allocable share of existing tax basis and tax basis adjustments that will increase the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company as a result of the Business Combination and as a result of sales or exchanges of Up-C Units for cash or shares of Class A Common Stock, and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s TRA liability associated with the allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in the Business Combination would give rise to a TRA liability of million . The Company has not recognized such liabilities under the TRA after concluding it was not probable that the Company will be able to realize the tax benefits based on estimates of future taxable income. No payments were made to the Continuing Equity Owners and Blocker Shareholders (as defined in the TRA) pursuant to the TRA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The estimation of liability under the TRA is, by its nature, imprecise and subject to significant assumptions regarding the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income of MSP Recovery, Inc. in the future. We may incur additional liabilities under the TRA when Class B Units are exchanged in the future. If the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets applicable to the tax attributes subject to the TRA is released in a future period, the relating TRA liability may be considered probable at that time and recorded within earnings. The Company has assessed the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and in that analysis, has considered the relevant positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024, which will be maintained until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. As the tax benefits associated with the TRA have not been recognized, based on estimates of future taxable income, the Company has concluded it is not probable to recognize any tax receivable agreement liability. If the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets is released in a future period, the TRA liability may be considered probable at that time and recorded within earnings.

The Claims are included as intangible assets , net in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Claims are held at cost, which was determined using the opening market price of the Company s Class A Common Stock as of the day subsequent to the Closing Date discounted by for lack of marketability due to timing before shares are sellable. The Company determined the appropriate measurement date was the opening of the first trading day of the Class A Common Stock after the Closing Date as this reflects the equivalent value of the Up-C Units provided to the sellers. The Up-C Units provided to the sellers did not include New Warrants, and as such, the Class A Common Stock value excluding the New Warrants was reflected at the Close of the first trading day after the Closing Date. The Claims are treated as finite life intangible a ssets similar to other Claims that the Company has acquired, and have a useful life of . For further details on the intangible assets resulting from Claims acquisitions, see Note 7, Intangible Assets, Net. VRM The Company acquired the rights to receive the distributable net proceeds (the Proceeds of a portfolio of Claims owned by VRM MSP, a Delaware limited liability company and joint investment vehicle of VRM and Series MRCS, in exchange for approximately million Up-C Units. Under this asset acquisition structure, the Company determined that the arrangements to acquire the rights to proceeds from certain Claims recovery rights along with the guarantee of the VRM Full Return (noted and defined below) result in the Company consolidating the Series. Upon consolidation, the Company included the value of the Up-C Units provided and the value of the guarantee as intangible assets, net in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. These are held at cost and treated as finite life intangible assets similar to other CCRAs that the Company has acquired, and have a useful life of . In connection with such transaction, the Company agreed to pay Virage an amount equal to the contributions by Virage to VRM MSP plus an annual rate of return of (the VRM Full Return ). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement with Virage, such amount is payable exclusively by any of the following means (or any combination thereof): (a) the Proceeds, net of expenses related to claim settlement, (b) a sale of certain reserved shares of Messrs.

 million as of September 30, 2024. As the Company incurred debt related to the VRM Full Return as included in the guaranty obligation within the condensed consolidated balance sheet, this value was included in the purchase price and is included in intangible assets, net, in the condensed consolidated balance sheet for the full value of the VRM Full Return at the acquisition date. Any subsequent interest accrual is reflected within interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. On April 12, 2023, the Company and Messrs. Quesada and Ruiz entered into an amendment (the Virage MTA Amendment to the agreement with Virage and the related Guaranty pursuant to which the payment date for the VRM Full Return was extended from May 23, 2023 until September 30, 2024, subject to acceleration upon certain triggering events. On November 14, 2023, the maturity date was extended to December 31, 2024. In addition, the Virage MTA Amendment changed the payment methods to Virage to exclusively be, in the following order of priority: (a) the Proceeds and any other sources of revenue or liquidity of the Company (and its subsidiaries) that are not encumbered by a lien of a party other than Virage and to the extent such revenues and liquidity exceed the amount of net of revenues necessary to establish and maintain an operating reserve of million (reduced to million on July 24, 2023) for certain Company expenses, (b) a sale of certain reserved shares of Messrs. John H. Ruiz and Frank C. Quesada, and the delivery of the resulting net cash proceeds thereof to VRM, (c) Parent s sale of additional shares and delivery of proceeds to Virage, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions, (d) if not satisfied by the foregoing, a sale of other shares of the Company by Messrs.

Quesada, and the delivery of the resulting net cash proceeds thereof to VRM; provided that if the VRM Full Return is not fully paid by September 30, 2024 the VRM Full Return shall be payable by any of such payment methods in any order of priority. The VRM Full Return became current on September 30, 2024, and the Company does not currently have available liquidity to satisfy said obligation. On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Virage MTA Amendment that extended the final payment date of the VRM Full Return to December 31, 2024, subject to acceleration upon certain triggering events. In addition, the Second Virage MTA Amendment (a) changed the minimum operating reserve from million to the budget of the Company (plus applicable taxes) plus and (b) required Virage and the Company negotiate and agree on a form of initial warrant and monthly warrant by no later than December 1, 2023. Pursuant to the Second Virage MTA Amendment, on January 1, 2024, the Company was required to make a one-time, lump sum payment to Virage for the period starting May 24, 2023 and ending December 31, 2023, in one or a combination of: (a) and/or (b) per share, in an amount equal to the quotient of 1.0 of each calendar month-end balance (which month-end balance shall be increased daily up to 20 per annum based on a formula set forth in the Virage MTA Amendment) of the amount owing to Virage as of each preceding calendar month end and the volume weighted average price of a share of our Class A common stock for the five day period prior to the issuance, each expiring from the date of issuance. Accordingly, the Company issued the VRM Warrants. The Initial Virage Warrant, as amended, was issued effective January 1, 2024 and entitles Virage to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock, with an expiration date of . The Virage Warrants are recorded as warrant liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Monthly Virage Warrants with effective dates prior to July 1, 2024 were issued, entitling Virage to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock. Monthly Virage Warrants with effective dates falling within the quarter ending September 30, 2024 were issued, entitling Virage to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock to settle interest payable for the months of June, July, and August, 2024. For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, the issuance of VRM Warrants settled million and million of interest, respectively. A Monthly Virage Warrant with an effective date of October 1, 2024 was issued after quarter end, entitling Virage to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock to settle interest payable for the month of September 2024. Until our obligations to Virage are paid in full, the Company has the option every month to continue to pay Virage an additional amount, in one or a combination of: (a) cash, in an amount equal to 1.0 of each calendar month-end balance (which month-end balance shall be increased daily up to 20 per annum based on a formula set forth in the Virage MTA Amendment) of the amount owing to Virage as of each preceding calendar month end and/or (b) the issuance of subsequent Monthly Virage Warrants. On April 1, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Virage MTA Amendment which: (i) extended the VRM Full Return payment due date to September 30, 2025, subject to acceleration upon certain triggering events, including the receipt of a going concern opinion by the Company s independent auditor; (ii) of the Company s portion of any net proceeds from the Yorkville SEPA would be used to pay down the VRM Full Return ; and (iii) commence the sale of certain reserved shares of Messrs. John H. Ruiz and Frank C. Quesada, and the delivery of the resulting net cash proceeds thereof to VRM. The VRM Full Return became current on September 30, 2024, and the Company does not currently have available liquidity to satisfy said obligation.

 The contribution of certain Series (holding certain CCRAs) by MSP Recovery into VRM MSP is considered a common control transaction, given that the Company consolidates Series before and after such transfers. In addition, the Company analyzed being admitted as a member of VRM MSP and concluded to apply Investments in Equity Method guidance under ASC 323. The Company initially measured and recorded its equity method investment in VRM MSP using a cost accumulation model; however, in consolidation, the investment in VRM MSP is eliminated, with the CCRA intangible assets remaining on the balance sheet under the Intangible assets line item. The investment in VRM MSP will reflect a zero balance. In addition, given VRM MSP s primary assets are the CCRAs, VRM MSP s ability to generate any earnings (not already reported via MSP Recovery consolidation of Series), is negligible; therefore, MSP Recovery does not expect any significant earnings from VRM MSP. Hazel Transactions Claims Transactions and Purchase Money Loan On March 29, 2023, the Company acquired a controlling interest in nine legal entities, whose sole assets are CCRAs, from Hazel. This is referred to as the Claims Purchase. The purchase price for the Claims Purchase was funded by: (i) a purchase money loan between Hazel, as a lender, and the Company, as a borrower, in the amount of million (the Purchase Money Loan and (ii) proceeds from the sale of certain, separate CCRAs in the Claims Sale (as defined below). Also, on , the Company sold a controlling interest in three legal entities whose sole assets are CCRAs to Hazel. The agreement provided that the Company and Hazel would share in the Recovery Proceeds therefrom, in accordance with an agreed waterfall after Hazel had realized the first million in Claim recoveries. This transaction is referred to as the Claims Sale, and together with the Claims Purchase, the Claims Transactions. As the Claims Transactions were negotiated together in contemplation of one another, they have been combined for accounting purposes. The Company analyzed the Claims Sale and determined that this transaction would be treated as the sale of in-substance non-financial assets, in exchange for noncash consideration in the form of the CCRAs from the Claims Purchase measured at fair value. The variable consideration related to future recoveries is fully constrained, because, at this time, it is not probable that any amounts will be owed above the million recovery threshold that would trigger additional payments. The Company analyzed the Claims Purchase and determined it results in the initial consolidation of variable interest entities that are not businesses. The acquired CCRAs held by those entities are recognized at fair value. The fair value of the assets sold in the Claims Sale was determined to be million. The Company s carrying value of those CCRAs surrendered was million. Because there are no other observable prices for such transactions, the Company determined the fair value by reference to the purchase price for those CCRAs in a recent transaction. The fair value of the acquired CCRAs was determined to be million, and the Company recognized the Purchase Money Loan recognized at million, as any implicit discount or premium to current market rates at the time of issuance were insignificant. This resulted in a gain on the Claims Transactions of million, which largely corresponds to the previously recognized amortization of the CCRAs that were sold in the Claims Sale. On August 2, 2024, Subrogation Holdings entered into a letter agreement to amend the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the HPH Letter Agreement with HPH, which, among other things, provides for a million loan (with a original issue discount) to be funded by August 31, 2024 for the purpose of acquiring additional Claims (the New Claims that will further collateralize the Working Capital Credit Facility. On August 29, 2024, the Company received funding of million under the Operational Collection Floor for the purpose of acquiring the New Claims from an existing Assignor. On August 30, 2024, the Company acquired recovery rights associated with the New Claims for million. The parties formalized the terms of the HPH Letter Agreement in Amendment No. 3 to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 1, 2024. Amounts borrowed and obligations under the Purchase Money Loan and the Working Capital Credit Facility (See Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable are secured by a pledge of proceeds from specific Claims in the Company s Claims portfolio,

Series PMPI is a series of MAO-MSO Recovery II LLC. The Company exercises significant influence over the operating and financial activities of Series PMPI, but does not exercise control of the entity. In accordance with Series PMPI s operating agreement, the controlling member is entitled to a preferred return of per annum (the Preferred Return ). Once the Preferred Return has been met, the controlling member is entitled to of Claims recoveries by PMPI. The non-controlling member is allocated of the costs of PMPI. Since the Preferred Return exceeds the total members equity of PMPI as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the value of the equity method investment in the condensed consolidated balance sheet is . The MAO-MSO Entities are Delaware limited liability companies formed as master Series entities whose central operations are to form other Series legal entities that will hold and pursue Claims recovery rights. The MAO-MSO Entities are not designed to hold or pursue Claims recoveries themselves. The Company holds a economic interest in both entities, and has significant influence through its equity investment, but does not control either entity. As equity method investments, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of net earnings or losses as equity earnings in Other income. The activity of these entities has been insignificant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Since the Company did not make a contribution to the MAO-MSO Entities, and the entities have recorded losses, the value of the equity method investment in the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

In 2023, in connection with an amendment to the VRM MSP structure, the Company became a direct investor in VRM MSP, which controls MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC, and recognizes this investment as an equity method investment. However, the Company previously consolidated and continues to consolidate the underlying Series of MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC, which hold investments in CCRAs that the Company controls as primary beneficiary under the VIE model. As such, other than the Series, which were already consolidated, the investment in VRM MSP includes only administrative activities that are not otherwise consolidated, and any costs are allocable to the other investors. As a result, the Company has no significant equity earnings or exposure to losses or obligations to fund this investment.

The Company monitors intangible assets for potential impairment indicators, including, but not limited to, assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future collections derived from its CCRAs. The Company continues to pursue recoveries from various parties under rights held through its CCRAs; however, extended delays may result in future impairment of the Company s intangible assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company updated the recoverability analysis on the definite-lived CCRA intangible assets performed as of December 31, 2023. The Company did not identify any new impairment indicators outside of the ones already disclosed in its evaluation of its definite-lived intangible assets in the 2023 Form 10-K. There are inherent risks in our business which could impact the recoverability analysis. As a result, factors may change in the future that could negatively impact our recoverability of the CCRAs, and may result in an impairment charge. Based on the analysis, the carrying value of the Company s CCRA intangible assets was deemed to be recoverable as of September 30, 2024.

Investments in Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities The Company has equity investments in VIEs, but does not consolidate them because it has no power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus is not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities. Those VIEs are reflected as equity method investments. Total assets and liabilities for these VIEs were million and million , respectively, at September 30, 2024 and million and million , respectively, at December 31, 2023. Generally, the Company s exposure is limited to its investment in those VIEs (see Note 5, Investment in Equity Method Investees ). For MAO-MSO Recovery II, LLC and Series PMPI, the Company may be exposed to providing additional recovery services at its own cost if recovery proceeds allocated to it are insufficient to recover the costs of those services. The Company does not have any other exposure or any obligation to provide additional funding to the VIEs that it has equity investments in. VRM MSP The Company became a member of VRM MSP through the contribution of certain Series (holding certain CCRAs) by MSP Recovery into VRM MSP. The Company determined, based on analysis of the rights to cash flows from the Series and the related guaranty obligation, that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the Series entities, and therefore should consolidate as of the transaction date. The contribution is considered a common control transaction, as the Company controls and consolidates the Series before and after such contribution. The Company consolidates the Series held within VRM MSP, however does not consolidate VRM MSP itself. Refer to Note 5, Investment in Equity Method Investees , for additional information on this VRM MSP transaction.

Item 2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Unless the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise noted, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Quarterly Report to LifeWallet, the Company, we, us, or our are to MSP Recovery, Inc., d/b/a LifeWallet, a Delaware corporation. The following discussion and analysis provides information that the Company s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company s condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read together with our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2023 and our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon the Company s current expectations, estimates, and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to, among other considerations, the matters discussed under Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." 
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain of the statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of words such as anticipate, believe, could, expect, intend, plan, predict, may, should, and will or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts, including, for example, guidance for portfolio recoverability. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. As a result, these statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and actual events may differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our industry, business, and operations, we cannot guarantee that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations. In evaluating such forward-looking statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks outlined under Risk Factors. Any forward-looking statement made by the Company herein speaks only as of the date made. The discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth in this Form 10-Q is not necessarily a complete or exhaustive list of all risks facing the Company at any particular point in time. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict or identify all such events or to assess either the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any individual risk factor, combination of factors, or new or altered factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. The Company has no obligation, and does not intend, to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future, except as required by federal securities laws. Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to, the Company s ability to capitalize on its assignment agreements and recover monies that were paid by the Assignors; the inherent uncertainty surrounding settlement negotiations and/or litigation, including with respect to both the amount and timing of any such results; the validity of the assignments of Claims to the Company; the ability to successfully expand the scope of our Claims or obtain new data and Claims from the Company s existing Assignor base or otherwise; the Company s ability to innovate and develop new solutions, and whether those solutions will be adopted by the Company s existing and potential Assignors; negative publicity concerning healthcare data analytics and payment accuracy; compliance with the listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market; and those other factors listed under Risk Factors below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and other reports filed by the Company with the SEC. 
 Our Business 
 We are a leading healthcare recovery and data analytics company. We focus on the Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance spaces. We are disrupting the antiquated healthcare reimbursement system, using data and analytics to identify and recover improper payments made by Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health insurers. 
 Medicare and Medicaid are payers of last resort. Too often, they end up being the first and only payers, because the responsible payer is not identified or billed. As Medicare and Medicaid pay a far lower rate than what other insurers are often billed, this costs the healthcare system (and the supporting taxpayers) tens of billions of dollars a year in improper billing and lost recoveries. By discovering, quantifying, and settling the billed-to-paid gap on a large-scale basis, the Company is positioned to generate meaningful annual recovery revenue at high profit margins. 
 Our access to large volumes of data, sophisticated data analytics, and a leading technology platform provide a unique opportunity to discover and recover on Claims. We have developed Algorithms to identify waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health insurance segments. Our team of experienced data scientists and medical professionals analyze historical medical Claims data to identify recoverable opportunities. Once potential recoveries are reviewed by our team, they are aggregated and pursued. Through statutory law and case law, we believe we have an established basis for future recoveries. 
 We differ from our competitors as we receive our recovery rights through irrevocable assignments of Claims. Rather than provide services under a third-party vendor services contract, we receive the rights to certain Recovery Proceeds from our Assignors. As assignees, we have control over the direction of the litigation and take on a risk that our competitors do not. We, or our affiliated entities, are the plaintiff in any action filed and have control over the direction of the lawsuit. By receiving Claims through assignment, we can pursue additional recoveries under numerous legal theories that our competitors cannot. Although we typically own assigned Claims, 
 34 

for a significant portion of assigned Claims, our ability to pursue recoveries depends on our ongoing access to data through data access rights granted to us. In these cases, termination of such data access would substantially impair our ability to generate recoveries on those Claims. 
 Our current Claims portfolio has scaled significantly. We are entitled to a portion of any recovery rights associated with approximately 1,591 billion in Billed Amount (and approximately 380 billion in Paid Amount), which contains approximately 87.8 billion in Paid Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims, as of September 30, 2024. We believe it would take any competitor significant time to amass the portfolio of Claims rights currently owned by us due to, among things, the volume of our Claims data retained and strength of our data analytics, which we believe are key to attracting new clients that are willing to assign Claims to us. 
 Healthcare Industry 
 Our business is directly related to the healthcare industry and is affected by healthcare spending and complexity in the healthcare industry. We estimate that our total potentially serviceable market is over 150 billion annually. Our primary focus is on the Medicare and Medicaid market segments. Medicare is the second largest government program, with annual expenditures during 2022 of approximately 944 billion for approximately 65.7 million enrollees. Medicaid has a combined estimated annual expenditure during 2022 of approximately 805 billion for approximately 88.4 million enrollees. Of the billions spent yearly by Medicare on medical expenses for its beneficiaries, we estimate that at least 10 of this was improperly paid by private Medicare plans. 
 Our potentially serviceable market is impacted by the expansion or contraction of healthcare coverage and spending, which directly affects the number of Claims available. The Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS has projected that health spending will continue to grow at an average rate of 5.4 a year between 2022 and 2031. We also believe reimbursement models may become more complex as healthcare payers accommodate new markets and lines of business and as advancements in medical care increase the number of testing and treatment options available. As reimbursement models grow more complex and healthcare coverage increases, the complexity and number of Claims may also increase, which could impact the demand for our solutions. Such changes could have a further impact on our results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 95.8 of our expected recoveries arise from Claims being brought under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act. While we believe the MSP Act has bipartisan support, changes to the laws on which we base our recoveries, particularly the MSP Act, can adversely affect our business. Our ability to generate future revenue is therefore significantly dependent on factors outside our control. 
 Our Business Model 
 Recovery Model 
 In our current business model, we receive irrevocable assignments of health Claim recovery rights through CCRAs from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, MAOs, MSOs, HMOs, hospitals, and other at-risk entities. Prior to executing a CCRA, we utilize our proprietary internal data analytics platform to review the set of Claims and identify Claims with possible recovery paths. 
 Once Claims have been assigned, our data analysts use our proprietary Algorithms to identify potential recoveries. Results are then quality checked by our internal medical team. We contract with the Law Firm and various other law firms across the country to pursue recoveries through the legal system. Where appropriate, Law Firm reaches out to the liable parties to demand payment of amounts that are owed. Prior to litigation, there may be an incentive for the primary insurer to settle. If legal action is required to pursue recovery from primary insurers, we seek double damages under the MSP Act. 
 We engage with each Assignor independently. We are typically entitled to 100 of recoveries pursuant to our CCRA. From those recoveries, we are typically contractually obligated to pay 50 of Net Proceeds to the Assignor. In certain cases, we have purchased the Assignor s rights to Recovery Proceeds in advance of any collection; therefore, entitling the Company to retain 100 of the Net Proceeds. The Net Proceeds of any assigned Claim is defined as the gross amount recovered on an assigned Claim, minus any costs directly traceable to such assigned Claim(s) for which recovery was made. In some instances, we may purchase outright an Assignor s recovery rights; in such instances, we are entitled to the entire recovery. In some cases, we have entered into arrangements to transfer CCRAs or rights to proceeds from CCRAs to other parties. Such sales include variable consideration in the form of payments that will be made only upon achievement of certain recoveries or based on a percentage of actual recoveries. We have not yet generated substantial revenue from the recovery model. 
 MSP Recovery Clearinghouse 
 We developed the MSP Recovery Clearinghouse, formerly known as MSP Lien Resolver, to identify, quantify, and resolve outstanding liens. By law, Medicare and MA Plans are payers of last resort, making no-fault insurers the primary payers, responsible to exhaust their policy limits to pay for accident-related claims before Medicare bears any responsibility. Healthcare providers often submit Claims for the payment of medical services rendered after an accident to the patient s health insurer, either seeking conditional payments, pending reimbursement by a primary payer, or entirely unaware that a primary payer has payment obligations. Medicare is unable to effectively verify if and how much is owed for any particular claimant if they are not aware that there is a Primary Payer involved. 
 35 

Federal law requires primary payers to maintain and report the key identifiers for all claimants (such as their name, Social Security number, address, etc.) that are used to determine Medicare status on a regular basis and determine all claimant s Medicare status before settling any injury claim. These steps are required to ensure that Medicare is alerted to primary payer obligations and to seek reimbursement. Primary payers routinely fail to fulfill these two duties, leaving Medicare in the dark and footing the bill. The result is a loophole for insurers, as Medicare relies on primary payer reporting to identify payment or reimbursement obligations. The Company has proved that in some instances primary payers have as little as a 2 reporting rate, thus failing to comply with the law 98 of the time. 
 The Company developed MSP Recovery Clearinghouse in an effort to reduce or eliminate this problem. MA Plans have and continue to provide claims data to the Company, including lists of beneficiaries along with diagnosis and treatment codes, and payment data. The Company aggregates this data into the MSP Recovery Clearinghouse, which compares the information with other publicly available sources. Proprietary algorithms then analyze these unique data sets against the list of beneficiaries to discover compensable Claims. The MSP Recovery Clearinghouse s three-step data comparison claim identification process reveals the full universe of beneficiaries and both reported and unreported Claims. 
 Step One: Gather the Data Sets. Through a simple electronic query, primary payers can provide to the MSP Recovery Clearinghouse a report with key identifiers for all insureds who have made and/or settled claims. 

Step Two: Discover Reimbursable Claims. The MSP Recovery Clearinghouse applies algorithms and data matching protocols to identify any claimant matches between the primary payer and Medicare Advantage plans, generating a report of what the Primary Payer owes for unreimbursed conditional payments. 

Step Three: Quality Control. The parties engage in quality-control procedures to ensure the validity of the generated report. 

The amount owed is calculated and a demand to settle is made. If no agreement can be reached, the litigation moves forward. The MSP Recovery Clearinghouse model may also be used by primary payers to proactively resolve liens and ensure future compliance with federal law. 
 Chase to Pay 
 Over time, the Company believes that a large part of the flaws that exist in the marketplace can be significantly improved by the solutions that can be achieved by our Chase to Pay model. Chase to Pay is a near real-time analytics driven platform that identifies the proper primary insurer at the point of care or close enough in proximity for payers to determine primary and secondary payers. Chase to Pay is intended to plug into near real-time medical utilization platforms used by providers at the points of care. Rather than allow an MAO to make a wrongful payment whereby the payer needs to chase down the primary payer and collect a reimbursement for the MAO, Chase to Pay is intended to prevent the MAO from making a wrongful payment and ensure that the correct payer pays in the first instance. Furthermore, the primary payer typically will make payments at a higher multiple than the MAO would have paid, and MSP will be entitled to receive its portion of the Recovery Proceeds on the amounts paid by the primary payer. Chase to Pay is powered, in part, by Palantir s Foundry platform utilizing LifeWallet s industry knowledge. 
 As Chase to Pay was designed to work at or around the point of care, it is expected to substantially decrease legal costs of recovery. As a result, when implemented, Chase to Pay is expected to improve the net recovery margin as the recovery multiple grows and variable legal costs to recover decline. As a result of having already received data from insurance carriers we've settled with for historical claims, and based on the agreement with said carriers to receive data daily therefrom for one year from the date of the settlement, the Chase to Pay model can be utilized to the extent that we can match the insurance carrier with Claims data received from our Assignors. 
 Although we have not yet generated revenue from this model, some customers send data to LifeWallet on a monthly or quarterly basis. The Company is working to increase the number of customers that provide daily data outputs. We are currently in the process of determining the pricing and form of these arrangements. As part of our Chase to Pay model, we launched LifeWallet in January 2022, a platform powered by our sophisticated data analytics, designed to locate and organize users medical records, facilitating efficient access to enable informed decision-making and improved patient care. 
 Claims Recovery Services 
 We may also recognize Claims recovery service revenue from our services to customers to assist those entities with the pursuit of Claims recovery rights. We provide services to other parties to identify recoverable Claims and provide data matching and legal services. Under our Claims recovery services model, we do not own the rights to Claims but provide our services for a fee based on budgeted expenses for the month with an adjustment for the variance between budget and actual expense from the prior month. 
 We were a party to that certain Recovery Services Agreement (the MSP RH Series 01 Recovery Services Agreement ), dated as of October 23, 2020, by and between MSP Recovery Holdings Series 01, LLC MSP RH Series 01 and MSP Recovery, pursuant to which MSP Recovery provided services including identifying, processing, prosecuting, and recovering money for certain Claims of MSP RH Series 01. On March 29, 2023, this service fee agreement was terminated in connection with the series of agreements discussed in further detail in the Hazel Transactions section of Note 4, Asset Acquisitions . 
 36 

The fees received pursuant to this agreement are related to expenses incurred and are not tied to the Billed Amount or potential recovery amounts. Although we believe our future business to be highly tied to the recovery model and Chase to Pay, we will continue to enter into these contracts as the market dictates. 
 Recent Updates 
 Recent Settlements 
 On July 16, 2024, the Company reached a comprehensive settlement (the July 2024 Settlement with a group of affiliated property and casualty insurers P C Insurers ). The terms of the confidential settlement agreements include: 
 The P C Insurers agreement to provide ten years of historical data (identifying all claims processed from January 1, 2014, through the effective date) and data sharing of future claims, extending out for one year, assisting LifeWallet in reconciling its current and future assigned Medicare claims to be able to collect on owned claims that are owed as a result of failure to pay or reimburse; 

The P C Insurers Implementation of LifeWallet s coordination of benefits clearinghouse solution; 

A 10-year agreement to resolve cooperatively, or through binding mediation, relevant Medicare claims (liens) that LifeWallet owns today and in the future; 

The P C Insurers agreement that they are primary payers for any unreimbursed Medicare lien that the Company identifies from data sharing, and the P C Insurers agreement to assign all rights to collect against other third parties that either failed to pay liens or collected twice from Medicare funds and the P C Insurers; and 

A confidential cash payment to settle historical Claims. 

On August 19, 2024, the Company announced a 3.1 million cash settlement (the August 2024 Settlement with a pharmaceutical manufacturer in a case where the Company alleged that the manufacturer increased the price of a drug in violation of antitrust laws. 
 The revenue generated from the July 2024 Settlement and the August 2024 Settlement is included within the Claims recovery income in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Notice of Non-Compliance with Nasdaq Listing Requirements 
 On June 7, 2024, the Company was notified by Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff (the Staff that the Company was non-compliant with Nasdaq s Bid Price Requirement as the closing bid price for the Company s Class A Common Stock had fallen below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days (April 25, 2024 through June 6, 2024). Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company is provided with a compliance cure period of 180 calendar days, or until December 4, 2024, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. On September 25, 2024, stockholders holding at least a majority of our outstanding voting capital stock, including our Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock, approved by written consent a resolution authorizing the Board of Directors to amend the Company s Charter, to effect a reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of the Company s Common Stock at a reverse stock split ratio ranging from 1:3 to 1:30, and to authorize the Company s Board of Directors to determine, at its discretion, the timing of the amendment and the specific ratio of the Reverse Stock Split. As announced on November 12, 2024, the Board determined to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split at a ratio of 1:25, which it expects to be effectuated by the open of business on November 18, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split would cause the amounts of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock of 30,975,324 and 124,067,498, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, to result in 1,239,013 and 4,962,700 after giving effect to the Reserve Stock Split. 
 If the Company does not regain compliance during such 180-day compliance period, the Company may be eligible to transfer its listing to the Nasdaq Capital Market, so as to take advantage of the additional 180-day compliance period offered on that market, provided that the Company meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable initial listing standards for Nasdaq, and provides a written notice of its intention to cure this deficiency during the second compliance period. If it appears to the Staff that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, it will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a hearings panel pursuant to the procedures set forth in the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules.

Key Factors Affecting Our Results 
 Our Claims Portfolio 
 We differ from some of our competitors because we obtain our recovery rights through irrevocable assignments. When we are assigned these rights, we take on the risk that such Claims may not be recoverable. We are entitled to pursue a portion of any recovery rights associated with approximately 1,591 billion in Billed Amount (and approximately 380 billion in Paid Amount), which contained approximately 87.8 billion in Paid Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims, as of September 30, 2024. We are typically entitled to 100 of recovery rights pursuant to our CCRAs, but contractually obligated to pay 50 of gross recoveries to the Assignor. In certain cases, we have purchased from our Assignors the rights to 100 of the recovery. By discovering, quantifying, and settling the gap between Billed Amount and Paid Amount on a large scale, we believe we are positioned to generate substantial annual recovery revenue at high profit margins for our assigned Claims. In litigation, our experienced management and legal teams provide us with a competitive advantage. While our model of being assigned the Claim rights allows us the flexibility to direct the litigation and potentially generate higher margins, we have, on an opportunistic basis, paid the Assignor an upfront purchase price for these rights. 
 To date, we have not generated substantial revenue from our Claims portfolio, and our business model is dependent on achieving revenue from this model in the future. If we are unable to recover the upfront purchase price from the assigned Claims or the investments we have made in pursuing recoveries, it would have an adverse effect on our profitability and business. 
 Our potential Claims recovery income in a given period will be impacted by the amount of Claims we review and ultimately pursue. The number of Claims that we review is driven by the Claims we receive through assignment. As we are assigned more Claims, we can review the Claims and identify additional recoveries. To expand our Assignor base and obtain more Claims, we plan to implement new strategies to secure new Assignors. These strategies will include a platform to educate potential Assignors about our company, making strategic business partnerships, potential mergers, as well as other marketing strategies. Our Assignors have grown from 32 in 2015, to 105 in 2018, to 123 in 2019, to 134 in 2020 and over 160 Assignors to date. If we are unable to continue to attract new Assignors to our platform, this could adversely affect future profitability. 
 In addition to obtaining new Claims, our ability to collect on identified Claims at our estimated multiples is key to our future profitability. Pursuant to the MSP Act, we believe we are entitled to pursue reasonable and customary rates. Under existing statutory and case law, the private cause of action under the MSP Act permits the pursuit of double damages when a primary plan fails to provide for primary payment or appropriate reimbursement. In addition to double damages, federal law provides express authority to pursue statutory interest from primary payers on any amounts owed. 
 As a result, we may pursue double damages and statutory interest in our MSP Act-related recoveries. We seek to recover these amounts under either the recovery model or the Chase to Pay model. Federal law also expressly provides MAOs with the right to charge providers for the Billed Amount when accident-related liability exists. Per the terms of various legal services agreements that MSP Recovery has with the Law Firm, for legal services provided, the Law Firm would receive a percentage of the total Claim recovery which would include double damages and additional penalties. Our ability to pursue double damages may be impacted by the RAMP Act as disclosed in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies . 
 Our Claims recovery revenue is typically recognized upon reaching a binding settlement or arbitration with a counterparty or when the legal proceedings, including any appellate process, are resolved. A decrease in the willingness of courts to grant these judgments, a change in the requirements for filing these cases or obtaining these judgments, or a decrease in our ability to collect on these judgments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Of the Claims identified as potentially recoverable, relating to our accident-related cases as of September 30, 2024, approximately 86.8 of claims are already in the recovery process, which are claims where either the recovery process has been initiated, data has been collected and matched, or resolution discussions are in process. 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 To evaluate our business, key trends, risks and opportunities, prepare projections, make strategic decisions, and measure our performance, we track several key performance indicators KPIs ). As our company has yet to achieve significant revenues and the drivers of expected revenues require significant lead time before revenue can be generated, management utilizes KPIs to assist in tracking progress, and believes such KPIs are useful in evaluating the performance of our business, in addition to our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The KPIs are Total Paid Amount, Paid Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims, Billed Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims, Recovery Multiple, and Penetration Status of Portfolio. 
 Total Paid Amount : The term Paid Amount is defined in the Definitions section above. As we continue to expand, we anticipate our revenue growth will be greatly dependent on our ability to increase the total Paid Amount and, correspondingly, the Paid Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims, in our portfolio. The Company s Paid Amount may increase or decrease over time based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, receiving new data from existing or new Assignors, and changes to our data processing procedures. Management believes this metric is a useful measure to investors and is useful in managing or monitoring company performance because we view an increase in Paid Amount as a positive indicator as it should provide the Company with the ability to increase the Paid Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims. Conversely, a decrease would produce a diminishing expectation of the Paid Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims. 
 38 

Paid Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims PVPRC : The term PVPRC is defined in the Definitions section above. We analyze our Claims portfolio and identify potentially recoverable Claims using our Algorithms to comb through historical paid Claims data and search for potential recoveries. The Company s PVPRC may increase or decrease over time based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, receiving new data from existing or new Assignors, changes to our data processing procedures, changes, developments, improvements or the elimination of Algorithms that identify potentially recoverable Claims, a decision by management not to litigate certain potentially recoverable Claims, or litigation updates affecting the viability of certain potentially recoverable Claims. PVPRC is a measure of the Paid Amount that has been paid to providers in respect of those potentially recoverable Claims. Management believes this measure provides a useful metric for potential recoveries, but it is not a measure of the actual amount that may be recovered with respect to potentially recoverable Claims, which in turn may be higher or lower based on a variety of factors. As non-compliance with Section 111 reporting requirements is commonplace, responsible reporting entities (RRE) routinely fail to report their responsibility to make primary payments; for this reason, data matching is often required to determine which reporting entity is responsible to reimburse a given potentially recoverable Claim. Our ability to generate future Claims recovery income is largely dependent on our ability to accurately identify potentially recoverable Claims through our data analytics and ultimately recover on these Claims. Management believes this metric is a useful measure to investors and in managing or monitoring company performance because we view an increase in PVPRC as a positive indicator as it should provide the Company with the ability to increase Claims recovery income and otherwise shows growth. 
 Billed Value of Potentially Recoverable Claims BVPRC : BVPRC represents the cumulative Billed Amount of potentially recoverable Claims. We analyze our Claims portfolio and identify potentially recoverable Claims using Algorithms to comb through historical paid Claims data and search for potential recoveries. The Company s BVPRC may increase or decrease over time based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, receiving new data from existing or new Assignors, changes to our data processing procedures, changes, developments or the elimination of Algorithms that identify potentially recoverable Claims, a decision by management not to litigate certain potentially recoverable Claims, or litigation updates affecting the viability of certain potentially recoverable Claims. For a majority of our Claims, the Company believes it has the ability to recover in excess of the Paid Amount by pursuing the Billed Amount plus interest plus double damages under applicable law. Under existing statutory and case law, the private cause of action under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act permits an award of double damages when a primary plan fails to provide for primary payment or appropriate reimbursement. We believe federal law expressly provides MAOs with the right to charge, or authorize the provider of such services to charge, in accordance with the charges allowed under a law, plan, or primary plan policy. We believe our ability to generate future Claim recovery income is largely dependent on our ability to accurately identify potentially recoverable Claims through our data analytics and ultimately recover on these Claims. Management believes this metric is a useful measure to investors and in managing or monitoring company performance because we view an increase in BVPRC as a positive indicator as it should provide the Company with the ability to increase Claims recovery income and otherwise shows growth. 
 Recovery Multiple : The vast majority of our recoveries are sought pursuant to the MSP Laws; however, some recoveries are sought under product liability, antitrust, and other various causes of action. For recoveries sought pursuant to the MSP Laws, we generally pursue amounts in excess of the Paid Amount; in other cases, the cause of action will dictate the amount pursued. The Recovery Multiple is the amount of any generated Claims recovery income obtained by the Company in respect to any Claims as compared to the Paid Amount of those Claims (e.g., if a given Claim had a Paid Amount of 100, a 600 recovery would represent a Recovery Multiple of 6x). For these purposes, we record values under the Recovery Multiple once we have recorded Claims recovery income, either through the receipt of cash or recognition of accounts receivable on the Claims. Management believes this metric is useful to investors to manage or monitor the Company s performance because the Recovery Multiple provides a measure of our ability to recover on Claims recovery rights. A Recovery Multiple above 1x would illustrate the Company s ability to recover amounts in excess of the Paid Amount. As actual recoveries have been limited to date, this measure has limited utility for historical periods. However, management believes this measure will become more meaningful during the next 12 months and beyond to the extent the Company begins to report actual increases in recoveries during those periods. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has obtained settlements where the Recovery Multiple was or would be in excess of the Paid Amount, and settlements at or below the paid amount. However, these settlements do not provide a large enough sample to be statistically significant and are therefore not shown in the table. As the Recovery Multiple is based on actual recoveries, this measure is not based on the Penetration Status of Portfolio, as described below. 
 Penetration Status of Portfolio : Penetration Status of Portfolio provides a measure of the Company s recovery efforts by taking into account the current stages of recovery of Claims in the portfolio and tying it in with the estimated market share of the related primary payers. The total percentage represents the estimated aggregate market share for the respective primary payers in which the Company is in some stage of recovery. As the Company initiates additional recovery efforts against additional primary payers, the Company expects this number to increase. These stages of recovery include where (1) the recovery process has been initiated, (2) data has been collected and matched, or (3) potential resolution discussions are in process. The Company uses third-party sources to estimate the aggregate market share of those primary payers in the property and casualty auto insurance market with whom the Company is engaged in one of these stages of recovery. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and in managing or monitoring company performance because it provides insight as to the estimated share of the market that is covered by existing recovery efforts. We estimate that cases that are in the potential resolution discussions and/or data matching are closer to generating potential future Claims recovery income.

(1) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has received total recoveries of 9.9 million. However, the settlement amounts do not provide a large enough sample to be statistically significant, and are therefore not shown in the table. 

(2) On August 10, 2022, the United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit held that a four-year statute of limitations period applies to certain claims brought under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act s private cause of action, and that the limitations period begins to run on the date that the cause of action accrued. This opinion may render certain Claims held by the Company unrecoverable and may substantially reduce PVPRC and BVPRC as calculated. As our cases were filed at different times and in various jurisdictions, and prior to data matching with a defendant we are not able to accurately calculate the entirety of damages specific to a given defendant, we cannot calculate with certainty the impact of this ruling at this time. However, the Company has deployed several legal strategies (including but not limited to seeking to amend existing lawsuits in a manner that could allow claims to relate back to the filing date as well as asserting tolling arguments based on theories of fraudulent concealment) that would apply to tolling the applicable limitations period and minimizing any material effect on the overall collectability of its claim rights. In addition, the Eleventh Circuit decision applies only to district courts in the Eleventh Circuit. Many courts in other jurisdictions have applied other statutes of limitations to the private cause of action, including borrowing the three-year statute of limitations applicable to the government s cause of action; and borrowing from the False Claims Act s six-year period. The most recent decision on the issue from the District Court of Massachusetts, for example, applies the same statute of limitations as Eleventh Circuit, but expressly disagrees with the Eleventh Circuit s application of the accrual rule and instead adopted the notice-based trigger that the company has always argued should apply. This would mean that the limitations period for unreported claims has not even begun to accrue. This is a complex legal issue that will continue to evolve in jurisdictions across the country. Nevertheless, if the application of the statute of limitations as determined by the Eleventh Circuit was applied to all Claims assigned to us, we estimate that the effect would be a reduction of PVPRC by approximately 9.9 billion. As set forth in our Risk Factors, PVPRC is based on a variety of factors. As such, this estimate is subject to change based on the variety of legal claims being litigated and statute of limitations tolling theories that apply. 

Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 The following represent the components of our results of operations. 
 Revenue 
 Claims recovery income 
 Our primary income-producing activities are associated with the pursuit and recovery of proceeds related to Claims recovery rights that the Company obtains through CCRAs, which are irrevocably assigned to us. As such, this income is not generated from the transfer of control of goods or services to customers, but through the proceeds realized from perfection of Claims recoveries from rights we own. We recognize Claims recovery income based on a gain contingency model; that is, when the amounts are reasonably certain of collection. This typically occurs upon reaching a binding settlement or arbitration with the counterparty or when the legal proceedings, including any appellate process, are resolved. 
 In some cases, we would owe an additional payment to the original Assignor in connection with the realized value of the recovery right. Claims recovery income is recognized on a gross basis, as we are entitled to the full value of recovery proceeds and make payment to the original Assignor similar to a royalty arrangement. Such payments to our Assignors are recognized as cost of Claims recovery in the same period the Claims recovery income is recognized. 
 Claims recovery service income 
 In the past, we have recognized Claims recovery service income for our services to a related party and a third party to assist those entities with pursuit of Claims recovery rights. We have determined we have a single performance obligation for the series of daily activities that comprise Claims recovery services, which are recognized over time using a time-based progress measure. We enter into Claims recovery service contracts with third parties. Amounts payable for services to third parties are typically based on budgeted expenses for the current month with an adjustment for the variance between budget and actual expenses from the prior month. 
 The Company did not recognize any claims recovery service income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other revenue 
 Other revenue consists of fee revenue generated by the Company s new electronic health records EHR platform, which went live in the second quarter of 2024. Other revenue was not significant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Costs of revenue 
 Costs of revenue consist of all directly attributable costs specifically associated with Claims processing activities, including contingent payments payable to Assignors (i.e., settlement expenses) and any other revenue generating activity. 
 Claims amortization expense 
 Claims Amortization Expense consists of the amortization of CCRA intangible assets for those CCRAs in which we made upfront payments or commitments in order to acquire Claims recovery rights. 
 40 

General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for employees involved in general corporate, sales, and marketing functions, including executive management and administration, legal, human resources, accounting, finance, tax, and information technology. Personnel-related expenses primarily include wages and bonuses. General and administrative expenses also consist of rent, IT costs, insurance, and other office expenses. 
 As we continue to grow as a company and build our team, we expect that our general and administrative costs will increase. 
 Allowance for credit losses 
 Allowance for credit losses consists of a specific reserve for a receivable amount due from Cano. Due to its material nature, it is included separately in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 Professional fees 
 Professional fees consist of consulting, accounting, and other professional fees that are charged for services provided by third-party vendors. 
 Professional fees legal 
 Professional fees legal consists of payments for the expenses of the Law Firm covered by a certain Legal Services Agreement and other legal professional services from third-party providers, including payments to co-counsel. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense consist of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment related to our investments in leasehold improvements, office and computer equipment, and internally generated capitalized software development costs. We provide for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets over their estimated useful lives. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense includes interest paid on the Nomura Note, Hazel Working Capital Credit Facility and Purchase Money Loan, Virage transactions (see Note 4, Assets Acquisitions ), Yorkville Advances, and Loans from related parties. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income consists of equity investment earnings, some affiliate related income, mark-to-market gain (loss) for payments due in stock, invoice cancellations, settlement income, and interest income. Other expenses consist of bank service charges, airing fees, tax penalties, settlement expense, political contributions and donations, and some affiliate related expenses. 
 Changes in Fair Value of Warrant and Derivative Liabilities 
 Changes in fair value of warrants and derivative liabilities consists of the mark-to-market of warrant liabilities due to Public Warrants and Virage Warrants as noted in Note 3, Business Combination . 
 Income Tax Benefit 
 As a result of the Business Combination, the Company became the sole managing member of MSP Recovery, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, MSP Recovery is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by MSP Recovery is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its partners, including MSP Recovery, Inc. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to the Company s allocable share of income of MSP Recovery. The Company s deferred tax balances reflect the impact of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the Company s tax basis. The balances are stated at the tax rates in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company reviewed the anticipated future realization of the tax benefit of the Company s existing deferred tax assets and concluded that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future.

Claims recovery income. Claims recovery income increased by 3.1 million to 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by increased settlements during the period. 
 Other revenue. Other revenue was 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is related to a new service introduced in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased by 1.1 million to 1.7 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by Assignor and law firm costs, which are directly correlated to the increase in claims recovery income. 
 Claims amortization expense. Claims amortization expense remained constant in three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.8 million to 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by decreases in marketing and promotions of 0.5 million, rent expense of 0.1 million, dues subscriptions and licenses of 0.1 million, and insurance expenses of 0.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 0.1 million in salaries, benefits and payroll expenses. 
 Professional fees. Professional fees increased by 0.8 million to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase of 1.5 million in corporate legal fees and 0.4 million in consulting fees, offset by a 0.7 million reduction in accounting fees, and a 0.5 reduction in other professional fees. 
 Professional fees legal. Professional fees legal decreased by 4.7 million to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to fees to outsourced law firms being managed by the Law Firm. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense increased by 18.4 million to 106.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase due to the guaranty obligation, the new Hazel Working Credit Facility and Purchase Money Loan, as well as increases in the basis for which interest is incurred on our Claims financing obligations and accrued interest on the related party loan. 
 Other income (expense), net. Other income, net increased by 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 0.4 million gain on debt extinguishment.

The change in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities increased 45.0 million to 45.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 45.3 million gain related to a mark-to-market adjustment to the fair value of Public Warrants and Virage Warrants. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the 0.3 million gain related to a mark-to-market adjustment to the fair value of Public Warrants.

Claims recovery income. Claims recovery income increased by 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by increased settlements during the period. 
 Claims recovery service income. Claims recovery service income decreased by 0.5 million to 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by third-party service fees related to a contract that expired during 2023 and did not renew. 
 Other revenue. Other revenue was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is related to a new service introduced in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased by 1.5 million to 3.5 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by assignor and law firm costs, which are directly correlated to the increase in claims recovery income. 
 Claims amortization expense. Claims amortization expense increased by 7.5 million to 363.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by increased amortization due to the acquisition of CCRAs. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by 3.5 million to 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in marketing and promotions of 3.3 million, salaries, benefits and payroll expenses and taxes of 0.2 million, and insurance of 0.3 million, offset primarily by an increase in rent expense of 0.2 million and information technology expenses of 0.2 million, mainly data storage, among others. 
 Professional fees. Professional fees decreased by 3.6 million to 12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a 4.1 million reduction in consulting fees, 3.0 million management fees in 2023 that did not reoccur in 2024, and 1.2 million reduction in other professional fees, offset by an increase of 4.7 million in corporate legal fees. 
 Professional fees legal. Professional fees legal decreased by 16.7 million to 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to fees to outsourced law firms being managed by the Law Firm.

Allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 5.0 million, entirely related to an amount due from Cano which has been reserved considering their public filings which included a substantial doubt about Cano s ability to continue as a going concern.

 Interest expense. Interest expense increased by 102.3 million to 306.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase due to the guaranty obligation, the new Hazel Working 
 43 

Credit Facility and Purchase Money Loan, as well as increases in the basis for which interest is incurred on our Claims financing obligations and accrued interest on the related party loan. 
 Other income (expense), net. Other income, net decreased by 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 4.6 million gain on sale of CCRAs during 2023 that did not reoccur in 2024, and a 3.4 million reduction in the mark-to-market gain on liability payable in stock, which were partially offset by 0.4 million gain on debt extinguishment.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the 4.4 million gain in 2023 related to a mark to market adjustment to the fair value of Public Warrants. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, this Quarterly Report also contains non-GAAP financial measures. We consider adjusted net loss and adjusted operating loss as non-GAAP financial measures and important indicators of performance and useful metrics for management and investors to evaluate the Company s ongoing operating performance on a consistent basis across reporting periods. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors. Adjusted net loss represents net loss adjusted for certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, and adjusted operating loss items represent operating loss adjusted for certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most relevant GAAP measure is included below:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Going Concern 
 As an early-stage growth company, the Company has incurred substantial net losses since inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash totaling 4.7 million, and as of October 31, 2024, the company had unrestricted cash totaling 5.6 million. The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows since inception and has an accumulated deficit of 159.4 million as of September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used approximately 17.9 million of cash in operations. The Company s liquidity will depend on the ability to generate substantial revenue in the near future, the timing and amount of which is uncertain, as well as its ability to secure funding from additional third-party capital sources. The Company s principal liquidity needs have been working capital, debt service, and Claims financing obligations. 
 The Company anticipates sources of liquidity to include the Working Capital Credit Facility and the Yorkville SEPA as disclosed in Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable , and has taken several actions to address liquidity concerns, including actions enumerated below. However, as discussed further below, the Company has concluded management s plans were not sufficient to alleviate the substantial doubt: 
 1. On March 29, 2023, the Company s subsidiary, Subrogation Holdings, LLC and its parent, MSP Recovery, entered into the Working Capital Credit Facility consisting of commitments to fund up to 48 million in proceeds. Certain terms were amended to the Working Capital Credit Facility, which were memorialized in the Second Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement dated November 10, 2023. See summary in Hazel Working Capital Credit Facility and Hazel Purchase Money Loan in Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable . On August 2, 2024, HPH agreed to, among other things, (i) extend the period for the Company draw up to 14 million for working capital, accessible in eight tranches 

44 

of 1.75 million, that can be drawn at least one month apart, until September 2025 and (ii) provide for a 2.0 million loan to be funded by August 31, 2024 for the purpose of acquiring the New Claims. The Company has 5.25 million of remaining capacity for working capital under the Operational Collection Floor as of the date of this filing. 

2. On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into the MTA Amendment No. 2 and Amendment to the Amended and Restated Security Agreement Second Virage MTA Amendment ), which extended the due date for the payment obligations to Virage to December 31, 2024. See summary in Note 4, Asset Acquisitions . On April 1, 2024, the Company entered into the MTA Amendment No. 3 and Amendment No. 2 to the Amended and Restated Security Agreement Third Virage MTA Amendment ), which: (i) extended the VRM Full Return payment due date to September 30, 2025, subject to acceleration upon certain triggering events; (ii) the Company agreed that, after the Convertible Notes are fully satisfied, 25 of the Company s portion of any net proceeds from the Yorkville SEPA would be used to pay down the VRM Full Return; and (iii) commence the sale of certain reserved shares of Messrs. John H. Ruiz and Frank C. Quesada, and the delivery of the resulting net cash proceeds thereof to VRM. The VRM Full Return guaranty obligation became current on September 30, 2024, and the Company does not currently have available liquidity to satisfy said obligation. 

3. On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Nomura Note (defined in Note 3, Business Combination ), which extended the maturity date of the Nomura Note to December 31, 2024. See summary in Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable . On March 26, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Nomura Promissory Note, which extended the maturity date of the Nomura Note to September 30, 2025. The note became current on September 30, 2024, and the Company does not currently have available liquidity to satisfy said obligation. 

4. On November 14, 2023, the Company entered into the Yorkville SEPA, which included the issuance of Convertible Notes to Yorkville having aggregate principal amounts of up to 15.0 million in connection with the purchase of Class A Common Stock. See summary in Committed Equity Facility within Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable . On April 8, 2024, the maturity date of the Convertible Notes was extended to September 30, 2025. The Convertible Notes became current on September 30, 2024, and the Company does not currently have available liquidity to satisfy said obligations. 

The Company has concluded that, despite the aforementioned financing arrangements, there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Unless we are successful in raising additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, we have concluded it is probable we will be unable to continue to operate as a going concern beyond the next twelve months. In the event that the Company receives an audit report from its independent registered public accounting firm with an emphasis of matter paragraph as to going concern in connection with the Company s audited annual financial statements, such event would result in an event of default in the aforementioned debt agreements, which would result in the debt becoming immediately due; however, the Company has received waivers from (i) Virage and VRM and (ii) HPH and Hazel if such an event were to occur for the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash totaling 4.7 million. Over the next twelve months, the Company anticipates that its sources of liquidity will be its current cash on hand, the Working Capital Credit Facility and the Yorkville SEPA, as disclosed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 4.7 million of cash on hand, and 8.75 million of available capacity under the Working Capital Credit Facility. The Company has 5.25 million of remaining capacity for working capital under the Operational Collection Floor as of the date of this filing. 
 Hazel Working Capital Credit Facility 
 On March 29, 2023, Subrogation Holdings entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Working Capital Credit Facility with Hazel Partners Holdings LLC HPH ), an affiliate of Hazel, as the lender and administrative agent, which provides for up to 80 million (with a 40 original issue discount), consisting of a Term Loan A commitment to fund up to 30 million in proceeds (in multiple installments), and a Term Loan B Commitment to fund up to 18 million in proceeds (in multiple installments), the funding of each conditioned on certain milestones. The amended terms to the Working Capital Credit Facility were memorialized in the Second Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement dated November 10, 2023 (as further amended by the amendments thereto dated December 15, 2023, December 22, 2023, and October 1, 2024, the Hazel Credit Agreement ). 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received funding with an aggregate amount of 20.5 million under Term Loan A, which was terminated in 2023. The parties agreed to increase the Term Loan B commitment from 18 million to 27.5 million, after giving effect to the original issue discount on the Working Capital Credit Facility, which would be funded in multiple installments and in accordance with the terms of the Working Capital Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company received funding with an aggregate amount of 20.8 million under Term Loan B. 
 On August 2, 2024, Subrogation Holdings entered into a letter agreement to amend the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the HPH Letter Agreement with HPH, which, among other things, provides for a 3.3 million loan (with a 40 original issue discount) to be funded by August 31, 2024 for the purpose of acquiring additional Claims (the New Claims that will further collateralize the Working Capital Credit Facility. On August 29, 2024, the Company received funding of 2.0 million under the 
 45 

Operational Collection Floor for the purpose of acquiring the New Claims from an existing Assignor, and on August 30, 2024, the Company acquired recovery rights associated with the New Claims for 2.0 million. The parties formalized the terms of the HPH Letter Agreement in Amendment No. 3 to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 1, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received under the Operational Collection Floor: (i) on August 2, 2024, 3.5 million of working capital for July and August 2024; (ii) on September 3, 2024, 1.75 million of working capital for September 2024; (iii) on October 2, 2024, 1.75 million of working capital for October 2024; and (iv) on October 24, 2024, 1.75 million of working capital for November 2024. The Company has 5.25 million of remaining capacity for working capital under the Operational Collection Floor as of the date of this filing. 
 Amounts borrowed and obligations under the Working Capital Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of proceeds from certain Claims in the Company s Claims portfolio, with the lien securing the Purchase Money Loan being subordinated and junior to the lien securing the Working Capital Credit Facility. Pursuant to Amendment No. 3 to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, Term Loan A and Term Loan B of the Working Capital Credit Facility are subordinated to the Operational Collection Floor and collateralized by the New Claims. 
 MSP Principals Promissory Note 
 On June 16, 2022, the MSP Principals provided cash to the Company to finance operations in an aggregate amount of 112.8 million. The Company issued the MSP Principals Promissory Note to the MSP Principals in an aggregate principal amount of 112.8 million that has an annual interest rate of 4 , payable in kind, and matures on the day that is the four-year anniversary of the issuance. On the maturity date, the Company is required to pay the MSP Principals an amount in cash equal to the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The promissory note is prepayable by the Company at any time, without prepayment penalties, fees or other expenses. In addition to the amounts in the Promissory Note, at the merger date with LCAP, the MSP Principals contributed 13.0 million through funds that had been loaned to VRM MSP to cover related service fees. A portion of the proceeds under the MSP Principals Promissory Note in an amount equal to 36.5 million was advanced to the Law Firm for certain operating expenses as contemplated by the Legal Services Agreement. The MSP Principals Promissory Note contains customary events of default that would allow the MSP Principals to declare the MSP Principals Promissory Note immediately due and payable or the MSP Principals Promissory Note will immediately and automatically become due and payable without notice, presentment, demand, protest or other request of any kind. In addition, the MSP Principals Promissory Note may be accelerated by the MSP Principals if the Board of Directors of the Company (excluding the MSP Principals) terminates the Legal Services Agreement. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received a 4.95 million loan from the Law Firm, evidenced by an unsecured promissory note, to provide general operational funding. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of this promissory note is due 24 months from the date of the last advance from the Working Capital Credit Facility is made. This promissory note is payable by the Company at any time, without prepayment penalties, fees, or other expenses. The note does not carry any interest and can be repaid at any time or from time to time without a prepayment penalty. On March 4, 2024, the Board authorized the partial repayment of the Law Firm Loan in the amount of 0.4 million, which funds were to be used for the express purpose of paying property taxes on real property owned and pledged by the MSP Principals to HPH as collateral in connection with the Working Capital Credit Facility. 
 Virage Amendments 
 On April 12, 2023, we entered into an amendment (the Virage MTA Amendment to the Virage MTA and Virage Guaranty pursuant to which the VRM Full Return payment due date was extended from May 23, 2023 until September 30, 2024, subject to acceleration upon certain triggering events. The Virage MTA Amendment changed the payment methods to Virage to exclusively be, in the following order of priority: (a) a first priority lien on all sources of revenue of the Company not otherwise encumbered as of the date of the Virage MTA Amendment to the extent such revenues and liquidity exceed the amount of net of revenues necessary to establish and maintain an operating reserve Operating Reserve of 70 million (the Operating Reserve was reduced to 47.5 million on July 24, 2023) for certain Company expenses, (b) a sale of certain reserved shares of Messrs. John H. Ruiz and Frank C. Quesada, and the delivery of the resulting net cash proceeds thereof to VRM, (c) Parent s sale of additional shares and delivery of proceeds to Virage, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions, (d) if not satisfied by the foregoing, a sale by Messrs. Ruiz and Quesada other shares of Messrs. Ruiz and Quesada, and the delivery of the resulting net cash proceeds thereof to VRM; provided that if the VRM Full Return is not fully paid by September 30, 2024 the VRM Full Return shall be payable by any of such payment methods in any order of priority. In addition, in connection therewith, Messrs. Quesada and Ruiz agreed to certain transfer restrictions applicable to their common stock, and agreed to effectuate sales of Company common stock in certain circumstances. 
 On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Virage MTA Amendment that extended the VRM Full Return payment due date to December 31, 2024, subject to acceleration upon certain triggering events. The Second Virage MTA Amendment also: (a) changed the Operating Reserve from 47.5 million to the budget of the Company (plus applicable taxes) plus 10 , and (b) required Virage and the Company negotiate and agree on a form of initial warrant and monthly warrant by no later than December 31, 2023. In addition, pursuant to the Second Virage MTA Amendment, on January 1, 2024, the Company was required to make a one-time, lump sum payment to Virage for the period starting May 24, 2023 and ending December 31, 2023, in one or a combination of: (a) cash, in an amount equal to 1.0 of each calendar month-end balance (which month-end balance shall be increased daily up to 20 per annum based on a formula set forth in the Virage MTA Amendment) of the amount owing to Virage as of each preceding calendar month end and/or (b) warrants to purchase Class A common stock at 0.0001 per share, in an amount equal to the quotient of 1.0 of each calendar month-end balance (which month-end balance shall be increased daily up to 20 per annum based on a formula set forth 
 46 

in the Virage MTA Amendment) of the amount owing to Virage as of each preceding calendar month end and the volume weighted average price of a share of our Class A common stock for the five day period prior to the issuance. 
 Accordingly, the Company issued the VRM Warrants. The Initial Virage Warrant, as amended, was issued effective January 1, 2024 and entitles Virage to purchase 28,298,329 shares of Class A Common Stock, with an expiration date of January 1, 2026. The Virage Warrants are recorded as warrant liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Monthly Virage Warrants with effective dates prior to July 1, 2024 were issued, entitling Virage to purchase 58,129,012 shares of Class A Common Stock. Monthly Virage Warrants with effective dates falling within the quarter ending September 30, 2024 were issued, entitling Virage to purchase 91,033,992 shares of Class A Common Stock to settle interest payable for the months of June, July, and August, 2024. For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, the issuance of VRM Warrants settled 31.4 million and 145.9 million of interest, respectively. A Monthly Virage Warrant with an effective date of October 1, 2024 was issued after quarter end, entitling Virage to purchase 66,322,033 shares of Class A Common Stock to settle interest payable for the month of September 2024. 
 Until our obligations to Virage are paid in full, the Company has the option every month to continue to pay Virage in one or a combination of: (a) cash, in an amount equal to 1.0 of each calendar month-end balance (which month-end balance shall be increased daily up to 20 per annum based on a formula set forth in the Virage MTA Amendment) of the amount owing to Virage as of each preceding calendar month end and/or (b) the issuance of subsequent Monthly Virage Warrants.

 Yorkville SEPA 
 On January 6, 2023, we entered into a purchase agreement with YA II PN, Ltd., a Cayman Island exempted company Yorkville ), pursuant to which Yorkville committed to purchase up to 1 billion in shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth therein. On November 14, 2023, we entered into the Yorkville SEPA, which fully amended and restated the January 6, 2023 agreement. 
 Pursuant to the Yorkville SEPA, the Company has the right to sell to Yorkville up to 250.0 million of its Class A Common Stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Yorkville SEPA, from time to time during the term of the Yorkville SEPA. Sales of Class A Common Stock to Yorkville under the Yorkville SEPA, and the timing of any such sales, are at the Company s option, and the Company is under no obligation to sell any shares of Class A Common Stock to Yorkville under the Yorkville SEPA except in connection with notices that may be submitted by Yorkville, in certain circumstances as described below. 
 Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Yorkville SEPA, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, from time to time at its discretion until the Yorkville SEPA is terminated to direct Yorkville to purchase a specified number of shares of Class A Common Stock Advance by delivering written notice to Yorkville Advance Notice ). While there is no mandatory minimum amount for any Advance, it may not exceed an amount equal to 100 of the average of the daily traded amount during the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding an Advance Notice. 
 The shares of Class A Common Stock purchased pursuant to an Advance Notice delivered by the Company will be purchased at a price equal to (i) 98 of the VWAP of the shares of Class A Common Stock on the applicable date of delivery of the Advance Notice 
 47 

during regular trading hours on such date or (ii) 97 of the lowest daily VWAP of the shares of Class A Common Stock during the three consecutive trading days commencing on the date of the delivery of the Advance Notice, other than the daily VWAP on a day in which the daily VWAP is less than a minimum acceptable price as stated by the Company in the Advance Notice or there is no VWAP on the subject trading day. The Company may establish a minimum acceptable price in each Advance Notice below which the Company will not be obligated to make any sales to Yorkville. VWAP is defined as the daily volume weighted average price of the shares of Class A Common Stock for such trading day on the Nasdaq Stock Market during regular trading hours as reported by Bloomberg L.P. 
 In connection with the Yorkville SEPA, and subject to the condition set forth therein, Yorkville agreed to advance to the Company in the form of convertible promissory notes (the Convertible Notes an aggregate principal amount of 15.0 million. On November 14, 2023, we issued a Convertible Note to Yorkville in the principal amount of 5.0 million, resulting in proceeds to us of 4.73 million on November 16, 2023. On December 11, 2023, we issued a Convertible Note to Yorkville in the principal amount of 5.0 million, resulting in proceeds to us of 4.75 million. On April 8, 2024, we issued a third Convertible Note to Yorkville in the principal amount of 5.0 million, resulting in net proceeds to us of 4.75 million. 
 As required pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Nomura Promissory Note, 50 of the aggregate proceeds under the Yorkville SEPA will be used to repay amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Nomura Promissory Note (first towards accrued and unpaid interest, if any, then towards principal) and the remaining 50 of such proceeds will be used to repay amounts due under the Convertible Notes, if any, or be paid to the Company after the Convertible Notes are fully repaid. Pursuant to the Third Virage MTA Amendment, 25 of the Company s portion of any net proceeds from the Yorkville SEPA would be used to pay down the VRM Full Return after the Convertible Notes are fully satisfied. 
 Pursuant to the Convertible Notes, Yorkville has the option, subject to certain limitations, of exchanging on one or more occasions all or part of the then outstanding balance under the note for shares of our Class A Common Stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of: (i) a fixed price equaling 120 of VWAP the day prior to the date of the closing of each tranche (the Fixed Price or (ii) a variable price equaling 95 of the lowest daily VWAP during the seven consecutive trading days immediately preceding the exchange (the Variable Price ), but in no event may the variable price be lower than 0.15 per share (the Floor Price as lowered pursuant to the Yorkville Letter Agreement). With respect to the initial Convertible Note issued on November 15, 2023, the Fixed Price equals 8.0225 per share, with respect to the second Convertible Note issued on December 11, 2023, the Fixed Price equals 3.7136 per share, and with respect to the third Convertible Note issued on April 8, 2024, the Fixed Price equals 1.5050 per share. 
 Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, the Convertible Notes shall become immediately due and payable, and the Company shall pay to Yorkville the principal and interest due thereunder. Events of default include, among others: (i) the Class A Common Stock shall cease to be quoted or listed for trading, as applicable, on any primary market for a period of ten (10) consecutive trading days (the Company is currently quoted and listed for trading on the NASDAQ) and (ii) failure to timely file with the SEC any periodic report on or before the due date of such filing as established by the SEC, including extensions under Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act. In no event shall Yorkville be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Yorkville and its affiliates would exceed 9.99 of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company. If any time on or after November 14, 2023: (i) the daily VWAP is less than the Floor Price for ten consecutive trading days Floor Price Trigger ), (ii) the Company has issued substantially all of the shares available under the Exchange Cap (as defined below) Exchange Cap Trigger ), or (iii) the Parent is in material breach of the Registration Rights Agreement, and such breach remains uncured for a period of twenty trading days, or the occurrence of an Event (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) Registration Event Trigger and collectively with the Floor Price Trigger and the Exchange Cap Trigger, the Trigger ), then the Company shall make monthly payments to Yorkville beginning on the seventh trading day after the Trigger and continuing monthly in the amount of 1.5 million plus a 5.0 premium and accrued and unpaid interest. The Exchange Cap Trigger will not apply in the event the Company has obtained the approval from its stockholders in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq Stock Market for the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated in the Convertible Note and the Yorkville SEPA in excess of 19.99 of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the effective date of the Yorkville SEPA (the Exchange Cap ). 
 Yorkville, at its discretion and providing that there is a balance remaining outstanding under the Convertible Notes, may deliver a notice under the Yorkville SEPA requiring the issuance and sale of shares of Class A Common Stock to Yorkville at the Conversion Price in consideration of an offset of the Convertible Notes Yorkville Advance ). Yorkville, in its sole discretion, may select the amount of any Yorkville Advance, provided that the number of shares issued does not cause Yorkville to exceed the 9.99 ownership limitation, does not exceed the Exchange Cap or the amount of shares of Class A Common Stock that are registered. As a result of a Yorkville Advance, the amounts payable under the Convertible Notes will be offset by such amount subject to each Yorkville Advance. 
 The Company will control the timing and amount of any sales of shares of Class A Common Stock to Yorkville, except with respect to the conversion of the Convertible Notes. Actual sales of shares of Class A Common Stock to Yorkville as an Advance under the Yorkville SEPA will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, which may include, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the Company s Class A Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for our business and operations. 
 The Yorkville SEPA will automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of: (i) the first day of the month following the 36-month anniversary of the date of the Yorkville SEPA, or (ii) the date on which Yorkville shall have made payment of Advances pursuant to the Yorkville SEPA for shares of Class A Common Stock equal to 250.0 million. The Company has the right to terminate the Yorkville SEPA at no cost or penalty upon five (5) trading days prior written notice to Yorkville, provided that there are no outstanding Advance 
 48 

Notices for which shares of Class A Common Stock need to be issued and the Company has paid all amounts owed to Yorkville pursuant to the Convertible Notes. The Company and Yorkville may also agree to terminate the Yorkville SEPA by mutual written consent. Neither the Company nor Yorkville may assign or transfer the Company s respective rights and obligations under the Yorkville SEPA, and no provision of the Yorkville SEPA may be modified or waived by the Company or Yorkville other than by an instrument in writing signed by both parties. 
 The Yorkville SEPA contains customary representations, warranties, conditions and indemnification obligations of the parties. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in such agreements were made only for purposes of such agreements and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. 
 The net proceeds under the Yorkville SEPA to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells its shares of Class A Common Stock to Yorkville. The Company expects that any proceeds received from such sales to Yorkville will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 On April 8, 2024, the Company and Yorkville entered into the Yorkville Letter Agreement to: (1) reduce the Floor Price from 1.28 to 1.00; (2) waive the first monthly payment due to the Floor Price Trigger, thereby curing the Floor Price Trigger; and (3) extend the maturity date of the Convertible Notes to September 30, 2025. On April 12, 2024, Yorkville further agreed that, to the extent that it holds Class A Common Stock in such quantities that would prevent the Company from utilizing the SEPA solely due to the Ownership Limitation, Yorkville commits to fund an additional advance in the principal amount of 13.0 million on the same terms and conditions as the previous advances pursuant to the Yorkville SEPA. On May 2, 2024, the Company and Yorkville reached an agreement to: (i) reduce the Floor Price under the Yorkville SEPA from 1.00 to 0.50. On July 11, 2024, the daily VWAP for our Class A Common Stock had been below the Floor Price for ten consecutive trading days, resulting in a Floor Price Trigger. On July 12, 2024, Yorkville agreed to extend the due date for the first Monthly Payment, due as a result of a Floor Price Trigger, to September 11, 2024. On August 13, 2024, the Company and Yorkville reached an agreement to reduce the Floor Price under the Yorkville SEPA from 0.50 to 0.15, thereby curing the Floor Price Trigger pursuant to the terms of the Yorkville SEPA. At the close of trading on October 18, 2024, the daily VWAP for the Company s Class A Common Stock was below the Floor Price for ten consecutive trading days, resulting in a Floor Price Trigger, as defined in the Convertible Notes. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated November 7, 2024, Yorkville has agreed that the first Monthly Payment, as defined in the Convertible Notes, would be due from the Company no sooner than December 18, 2024. The Convertible Notes became current on September 30, 2024, and the Company does not currently have available liquidity to satisfy said obligations. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 10,049,967 and 11,859,069 shares to Yorkville, respectively, pursuant to investor notices delivered under the Yorkville SEPA at prices between 0.15 and 0.84 per share, and the proceeds were used to: (i) reduce amounts owed under Yorkville Note #1 by 1.3 million and 53.6 thousand of principal and interest, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 1.8 million and 0.2 million of principal and interest, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and (ii) 1.4 million and 2.0 million of payment to reduce amounts owed under the Amended and Restated Nomura Promissory Note for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Assignment and Sale of Proceeds Agreement 
 On June 30, 2022, the Company entered into an Assignment and Sale of Proceeds Agreement (the Assignment Agreement and a Recovery Services Agreement (the Services Agreement and collectively, the Agreements with the Prudent Group Prudent in order to monetize up to 250.0 million of the value of the Company s net recovery interest in Claim demand letters that the Company has commenced sending to insurers who admitted they had primary payer responsibility for the underlying accidents to the federal government Net Recovery Proceeds ). Pursuant to the Agreements, at the Company s sole and absolute discretion, the Company has the right to direct Prudent to acquire, on a non-recourse basis, a percentage of Net Recovery Proceeds, up to an aggregate of 250.0 million, at a purchase price of 90 of Net Recovery Proceeds of such Claim. 
 Under the Services Agreement, the Company will service and recover on the demand letters and will retain any revenues generated in excess of the amount received from Prudent, plus up to an 18 annual return on the amount Prudent paid for Net Recovery Proceeds. Prudent may terminate the Services Agreement upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to the Company. The Company plans to utilize the Assignment Agreement as funding is needed. To date, the Company has not exercised its rights pursuant to the Services Agreement and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. 
 Actual results, including sources and uses of cash, may differ from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates and any such differences may impact the Company s ability to continue as a going concern in the future. The expenditures associated with the development and launch of our additional recovery services and the anticipated increase in Claims recovery capacity are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which may affect the timing and magnitude of these anticipated expenditures. These risks and uncertainties are described in more detail in the Risk Factors section in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The Agreements that the Company entered into on June 30, 2022 with Prudent have been terminated effective August 13, 2024.

Investment Capacity Agreement 
 On September 27, 2021, the Company entered into an Investment Capacity Agreement (the ICA providing for potential future transactions regarding select healthcare Claims recovery interests with its investment partner, Virage, which transactions may include the sale of Claims by MSP. The ICA provides that the maximum value of such Claims will be 3.0 billion. 
 When the Company takes an assignment, the Company takes an assignment of the entire recovery but often has a contractual obligation to pay the Assignor 50 of any recoveries. This 50 interest typically is retained by the Assignor (the Retained Interest ), although in some cases, the Company has acquired all of the recoveries, and the applicable Assignor has not kept any Retained Interest. The Retained Interest is not an asset of the Company, but an obligation to pay these Assignors, with the Company keeping the other 50 interest on any recoveries. Virage s funding in connection with future transactions generally will be used to purchase Retained Interests from existing Assignors or new MSP Assignors, although its funds can also be used to buy 50 of the recoveries from the Company, in the event the applicable Assignor did not retain any Retained Interest. In connection with transactions consummated under the ICA, the Company may receive certain fees, including a finder s fee for identifying the recoveries and a servicing fee for servicing the Claims. 
 Pursuant to the ICA, the Company will assist Virage in acquiring these Retained Interests for a cash price. Virage will be paid the recovery generated from the purchased Retained Interests when received through litigation or settlements. The ICA is separate and distinct from the equity investment in the Company by VRM MSP (an affiliate of Virage). 
 The ICA has been terminated effective November 12, 2024. 
 Claims Financing Obligations 
 On March 29, 2023, the Company acquired a controlling interest in nine legal entities, whose sole assets are CCRAs, from Hazel. This is referred to as the Claims Purchase. The purchase price for the Claims Purchase was funded by (i) a purchase money loan between Hazel, as a lender, and the Company, as a borrower, in the amount of 250.0 million (the Purchase Money Loan and (ii) proceeds from the sale of certain, separate CCRAs in the Claims Sale. See Note 4, Asset Acquisitions . 
 On February 20, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a Claims Proceeds Investment Agreement CPIA with a third-party investor to invest directly and indirectly in Claims, disputes, and litigation and arbitration Claims. For such investment, the Company assigned to the investor a portion of the future proceeds of certain Claims, albeit the Company remained the sole owner and assignee of rights to Claims because the investor was only acquiring rights to a portion of the proceeds of the Claims. The investor return was based on its investment 23 million between the original and amended agreements) and an internal rate of return of 30 calculated from the Closing Date. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company finalized an Amendment to the CPIA and a Warrant Agreement with the third-party, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to amend the original CPIA and required payment terms. See Brickell Key Investmen ts within Note 10, Claims Financing Obligations and Notes Payable , for a description of the Claims financing obligations as amended. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement

The term of the TRA will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the TRA for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits under the TRA or certain other acceleration events occur. Any payments made by us under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us, and, to the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us.

 Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Contingencies 
 Based on claims financing obligations and notes payable agreements, as of September 30, 2024, the present value of amounts owed under these obligations were 638.3 million, including capitalized interest to date.

The Company is expected to repay these obligations from cash flows from claim recovery income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the minimum required payments on these agreements are 787.8 million. Certain of these agreements have priority of payment regarding any proceeds until full payment of the balance due is satisfied. The maturity of the commitments range from the date sufficient claims recoveries are received to cover the required return or in some cases by 2031. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 1,077.1 million of guaranty obligations. On April 12, 2023, we entered into the Virage MTA Amendment pursuant to which the payment date was extended from May 23, 2023 until September 30, 2024, subject to acceleration upon certain triggering events. On November 13, 2023, the maturity date was extended to December 31, 2024.

John H. Ruiz and Frank C. Quesada, and the delivery of the resulting net cash proceeds thereof to VRM. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates and any such differences may be material. 
 Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates are disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K, and there have been no material changes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 51 

Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to lack of completion of remediation of the material weaknesses identified in the 2023 Form 10-K related to human resources processes including the design and operation of controls over user access, IT change management over systems implementations, and the approval of payroll entries, and also material weaknesses over accounting for contract terminations, including accounting for the termination of vendor service contracts. Remediation of the aforementioned material weaknesses is in progress. 
 Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
 Investigations 
 As previously disclosed, on August 11, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC initiated an investigation of the Company, and requested documents relating to, among other matters, the Business Combination transaction with Lionheart Acquisition Corporation II consummated on May 23, 2022, certain historical and projected financial results, investor agreements, and data analytic platforms and Algorithms. The Company received a subpoena dated March 1, 2023 from the SEC regarding the aforementioned subject matter, and subsequently received a subpoena on May 10, 2023, in connection with the investigation relating to, among other matters, the Company s projections and the accounting and valuation of certain assets that were the basis for the Company s determination that its quarterly financial statements for the periods ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 require restatements and should no longer be relied upon, as disclosed in the Company s Form 8-K on April 14, 2023. On August 16, 2023, the Company received an additional subpoena from the SEC regarding certain funding sources of the Company prior to the Business Combination, various statements and disclosures by the Company in connection with, and following, the Business Combination, certain historical and projected financial results, and data analytic platforms and Algorithms used to identify potential recoveries. The Company intends to fully cooperate with the SEC in responding to the subpoenas. 
 In addition, on March 10, 2023, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney s Office USAO in connection with a grand jury investigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida requesting certain information concerning the Company, which subpoena requests documents relating to, among other matters, the Company s proprietary Algorithms and other software used to identify potentially recoverable claims, the drop in the price of the Company s common stock following the Business Combination, and certain marketing materials and investment agreements presented to potential investors. On July 18, 2024, the Company received an additional subpoena from the USAO, requesting documents related to a Company press release. To the best of the Company s knowledge, the Department of Justice has not issued any target letters to anyone associated with the Company as a result of this investigation (the United States Attorney s Manual states that a target is a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant). 
 The Company has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, fully with these inquiries. In connection with its review of the matters related to the preparation and filing of the 2022 Form 10-K, the Special Committee, along with external advisors retained thereby, also reviewed the subject matter of information requests related to the foregoing subpoenas received prior to June 2023. Based on that review, and the nature of the documents requested in the subsequent subpoena, the Company believes that the investigations will be resolved without any material developments; however, there can be no assurance as to the outcome or future direction thereof.

The Company has a 5.0 million receivable outstanding from Cano; however, due to Cano s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filings for the periods ending June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, which include a substantial doubt about Cano s ability to continue as a going concern, and Cano s subsequent filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on February 4, 2024, the Company established a reserve for the balance due under such receivable during 2023. These matters were automatically stayed as a result of Cano s bankruptcy filing. As of July 2024, the Debtors Plan has been confirmed and declared effective. The automatic stay of litigation has been lifted and the parties anticipate the ongoing litigation to re-commence under a new scheduling order. 
 On January 4, 2024, Cano sued Simply Healthcare Plans, Inc. Simply and the Company and affiliated entities seeking a declaratory judgment to determine whether the Cano Purchase Agreement should be rescinded, and whether Cano or the Company have standing to recover on claims assigned to the Company against Simply under the Cano Purchase Agreement. Cano also seeks damages 
 53 

from Simply relating to the claims assigned to the Company under the Cano Purchase Agreement. The Company intends to vigorously assert its position in all Cano related litigation.

 Attention: David Fine, Esq. 
 Re:	MSP Recovery, Inc. Pre-Paid Advance Monthly Payments 
 Dear Mr. Fine: 
 At the close of Primary Market 1 trading on October 18, 2024, the daily VWAP for MSP Recovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: LIFW) was below the Floor Price as defined in the Exchangeable Promissory Notes Notes issued to YA II PN, Ltd. Yorkville pursuant to the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement dated November 14, 2023 (the SEPA by and between Yorkville and MSP Recovery, Inc. MSP ), for ten consecutive Trading Days, resulting in a Floor Price Trigger pursuant to the Notes. 
 Pursuant my call with Matthew Beckman, this letter serves to memorialize Yorkville s agreement that the Monthly Payment, as set forth in Section (1)(c) of the Notes, would be due from MSP no sooner than the Trading Day that occurs two months after the Trigger Event, or for the sake of clarity, December 18, 2024. In addition, Yorkville acknowledges that, pursuant to Section 12(t) of the Notes, that MSP may reduce the Floor Price to any amount, as set forth in a written notice to Yorkville; provided that such reduction shall be irrevocable and shall not be subject to increase thereafter. 
 	Thank you for your flexibility. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. 
 Sincerely, 

1 All capitalized terms adopt the definitions as set forth in the SEPA and the Notes.
