of cash from operating activities, compared to for the same period in 2023. The debt under the
Current Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, amounted to approximately , reflecting an increase of since December
31, 2023. The Company received a Waiver and entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement under the Current Credit
Facility on May 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is in compliance with the terms of the Current Credit Facility. See Note
5. Debt for the terms of the Seventh Amendment. As of September 30, 2024, total outstanding debt was , with the nature and
terms of such debt further discussed in Note 5. Debt. 

Management s plans expect net sales to increase
in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 with increasing amounts into fiscal 2025 and thereafter. The Company believes that these plans
are supported by the Company s existing backlog, which increased from million as of December 31, 2023 to million at
September 30, 2024. Further, it anticipates receiving additional funded orders during 2024 and 2025 pursuant to Long-Term Agreements LTA agreements from its key customers as well as from new customers. With this visibility, the Company expects that it will generate sufficient
cash flow to make required principal payments (exclusive of any potential debt payment acceleration should the lender under the Current
Credit Facility choose to accelerate it) pursuant to the Current Credit Facility of approximately over the next twelve months.

in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 470-10-45, Debt Other Presentation
Matters , related to the classification of callable debt. The Company is required to maintain a collection account with its lender
into which substantially all cash receipts are remitted. If it were to default under the Current Credit Facility, the Company s
lender could choose to increase the rate of interest or refuse to make loans under the revolving portion of the Current Credit Facility
and keep the funds remitted to the collection account. If the lender were to raise the rate of interest, it would adversely impact the
Company s operating results. If the lender were to cease making new loans under the revolving facility, the Company would lack the
funds to continue operations. The rights granted to the lender under the Current Credit Facility combined with the reasonable possibility
that the Company might fail to meet covenants in the future raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for
the one year commencing as of the date of filing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

for the Company s alleged violation of the
terms of the subject sublease, specifically the failure to make the entire premises available by the Sublease commencement date. The validity
of the action is extremely suspect in that the subject sublease had no specific commencement date and Contract Pharmacal ultimately received
all the space. Discovery was conducted and the Plaintiff moved for summary judgement and to amend its complaint to add a new cause of
action all of which the company opposed. On July 8, 2021, the Court denied Contract Phamacal s motion for summary judgement
and to add an additional cause of action. In the Order, the Court granted Contract Pharmacal s Motions to drop its claim for specific
performance and to amend its Complaint to reduce its claim for damages to both of which benefit the Company. Following the Court s
decision, Contract Pharmacal filed a Motion to reargue its original motion which the Company again opposed. The Court denied that
motion on November 30, 2021 and then on March 10, 2022, Contract Pharmacal filed an appeal of the Court s decision with the Appellate
Division of the State of New York. Once again, the Company opposed that action. The Company was again successful as the Appellate
Division upheld the lower court s denial of Contract Pharmacal s motion for summary judgement and its motion to amend its
Complaint. Contract Pharmacal has now submitted a motion to the Appellate Division requesting leave to reargue the court s
denial of its original appeal. The Company will oppose that motion to reargue. The Company continues to dispute the validity
of the claims asserted by Contract Pharmacal and intends to contest them vigorously. We anticipate that due to this newest action by Contract
Pharmacal nothing of consequence will happen over the next twelve months. 

From time to time the Company may be engaged in
various lawsuits and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The Company is currently not aware of any legal proceedings
the ultimate outcome of which, in its judgment based on information currently available, would have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition or operating results. There are no proceedings in which any of the Company s directors, officers or affiliates,
or any registered or beneficial stockholder of its common stock, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 

. In determining the
estimated annual effective income tax rate, the Company analyzes various factors, including projections of the Company s annual
earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated, the impact of state and local income taxes, the ability to
use tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards, and available tax planning alternatives. 

As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023,
the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since the Company believes it is more likely than
not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to those
statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). This discussion contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should specifically consider the various risk factors identified in this report and
our 2023 Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

Business Overview 

We believe we are one of the leading manufacturers
of precision components and assemblies for large aerospace and defense contractors. Our rich history dates to 1941, producing parts for
World War II fighter aircraft. Since then, we have maintained an impeccable record with no known incidents of part failure leading to
a fatal mission. We became a public company in 2005. 

Our products include landing gear, flight controls,
engine mounts and components for aircraft jet engines and ground turbines and other complex machines. The ultimate end-user for most of
our products is the U.S. government, foreign governments, and commercial global airlines. Whether it is a small individual component for
assembly by others or complete assemblies we manufacture ourselves, our high quality and extremely reliable products are used in mission
critical operations that are essential for safety of military personnel and civilians. 

Although our net sales are concentrated amongst
a number of defense and aerospace prime contractors, we have cultivated long-standing relationships with a number of their subsidiaries
and/or business units. Additionally, our net sales are generated across several high-profile platforms and programs including: the F-18
Hornet, the E-2 Hawkeye, the UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopters, Geared Turbo Engines (used on smaller aircraft such as the Airbus A220 and
Embraer E2), the CH-53 Helicopter, the F-35 Lighting II and the F-15 Eagle Tactical Fighter. In many cases, we are the sole or single
supplier of certain parts and components and receive LTAs from our customers, both demonstrating their commitment to us. 

Winning a new contract award is highly competitive.
Our ability to win new contract awards generally requires us to deliver superior quality products, more quickly and with lower pricing
than our competitors. Accordingly, we must continually invest in process improvements and capital equipment. Recent investments in new
equipment have improved the productive capacity of our employees, increased our efficiency and speed, and expanded the size of products
we can manufacture. We strategically operate two state-of-the-art manufacturing centers in the U.S. This allows for rigorous oversight
of production and the adherence to stringent quality standards. Although there is currently a shortage of skilled workers, we maintain
a highly trained and close knit team of over 180 professionals committed to driving excellence and precision in every aspect of our operations. 

Our period-to-period net sales and operating results
are significantly impacted by timing. In addition, our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors, including the mix and complexity
of products, production efficiencies, price competition and general business operating environments. In some cases, our gross profit is
impacted by our ability to deliver replacement parts on short notice. Our operations have a large percentage of fixed factory overhead.
As a result, our profit margins are highly variable with sales volumes. 

For the past several years, despite facing significant
financial and operational challenges, we have strategically invested substantial amounts in new capital equipment, tooling, and processes
to bolster our competitive position. Additionally, we expanded our sales and marketing efforts, with a sharp focus on expanding relationships
with existing customers and cultivating new ones. Fiscal 2023 marked a year of overall progress and positioning for growth. During the
first nine months of 2024 and looking forward, our business strategy is geared towards achieving sustainable and profitable business growth.
We are firmly focused on securing new contract awards, improving operations and successful execution. 

With total unfilled contract values amounting
to 175.7 million (including our 105.2 million in backlog and all potential orders against LTA agreements previously awarded to us),
as of September 30, 2024, we are confident in our ability to boost sales during the remainder of 2024, attain profitability and improve
our financial position.

Results of Operations for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 

Net Sales: Net sales for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 were 12,555,000, an increase of 262,000, or 2.1 , compared with 12,293,000 that we achieved in the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period increase in net sales was primarily due to overall changes in the mix of
products requested by customers, which are discussed further below.

Period-to-period changes in customer mix and related
platforms and programs are largely attributable to customer requirements, availability of parts, production capacity and timing. 

Gross Profit: Gross profit for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,941,000 as compared to 1,228,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross
profit percentage for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 15.5 from the 10.0 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in margin can be attributable to changes in the sales across our major platforms, shifts in product mix, and overall
operating efficiencies. 

Operating Expenses: Operating expenses
was 1,874,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 150,000, from 2,024,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, operating expenses decreased to 14.9 , compared to the 16.5 achieved during the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The dollar decrease was primarily driven by reductions in stock compensation expense and our allowance
for credit loss, offset by increases in costs associated with the continued improvement of our information technology system and hardening
our cyber-security defenses. We continue to look for ways to reduce our costs and improve our operating performance and financial results. 

Interest Expense: Interest expense
(which includes amortization of deferred financing costs) was 482,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of
 34,000 or 6.6 from 516,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower borrowing
levels during a portion of the period. 

Net Loss: Net loss for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 was 404,000, compared to a net loss of 1,299,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, for
the reasons discussed above.

Gross Profit: Gross profit for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 6,491,000 as compared to 5,278,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross
profit percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 16.2 from the 13.9 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The increase in margin can be attributable to changes in sales across our major platforms, shifts in product mix, and overall operating
efficiencies. 

Operating Expenses: Operating expenses
were 5,931,000, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 229,000, from 6,160,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, operating expenses decreased to 14.8 , compared to the 16.2 incurred during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The dollar decrease was primarily driven by reductions in stock compensation expense and our allowance
for credit loss, offset by costs associated with the continued improvement of our information technology system and hardening our cyber-security
defenses. We continue to look for ways to reduce our costs and improve our operating performance and financial results. 

Interest Expense: Interest expense
(which includes amortization of deferred financing costs) was 1,418,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of
 54,000 or 3.7 from 1,472,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower borrowing
levels during a portion of the period, partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on outstanding debt pursuant to our
Current Credit Facility which increased to 7.83 in 2024 as compared to 7.44 in 2023. 

25 

Net Loss: Net Loss for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 was 812,000, compared to a net loss of 2,312,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for the
reasons discussed above. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As of September 30, 2024, we have debt service
requirements related to: 

1) Outstanding indebtedness under our Current Credit Facility
of 16,838,000 (consisting of a Revolving Loan of 11,437,000 and a Term Loan of 5,401,000). This debt matures on December 30, 2025,
and requires us to make monthly payments on the term loan of approximately 68,000 until the loan matures. 

2) Related Party Notes of approximately 6,162,000. This debt
matures on July 1, 2026. Pursuant to the Current Credit Facility we are permitted to make principal payments against this debt in the
amount of 250,000 per quarter, as long as certain conditions are met. 

3) Various equipment leases and contractual obligations related
to our business, including advances under our Solar Facility for the installation of solar energy systems including the replacement of
the existing roof at our Sterling Facility. 

Under the terms of the Current Credit Facility,
as amended, we are required to achieve EBITDA (as defined in the Current Credit Facility) at the end of each Fiscal Quarter on a rolling
basis, for the Fiscal Quarters ending September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024. Beginning with the Fiscal Quarter ending March 31, 2025
we are required to meet a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined) that is determined at the end of each fiscal quarter. This ratio is
a financial metric that we use to measure our ability to cover fixed charges such as interest and lease expenses as divided by EBITDA
(as defined in the Current Credit Facility) which represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
For the nine months cumulative period ending September 30, 2024, we achieved an EBITDA of 2,620,000 as compared to the 1,500,000. 

We obtained a waiver of the requirement to meet
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio at March 31, 2024, and met the financial covenants as of both June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024. Nevertheless,
we may fail to achieve the required covenants in the future. Therefore, we have classified the term loan that expires on December 30,
2025 as current as of September 30, 2024, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 470-10-45, Debt Other Presentation Matters ,
related to the classification of callable debt. We are required to maintain a collection account with our lender into which substantially
all of our cash receipts are remitted. If we were to default under our Current Credit Facility, our lender could choose to increase the
rate of interest we pay or refuse to make loans under the revolving portion of the Facility and keep the funds remitted to the collection
account. If the lender were to raise the rate of interest we pay, it would adversely impact our operating results. If the lender were
to cease making new loans under our revolving facility, we would lack the funds to continue our operations. The rights granted to our
lender under the Current Credit Facility combined with the possibility that we might fail to meet covenants in the future raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the one year commencing as of the issuance of these condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

The following is a brief discussion of recent
amendments to the Current Credit Facility (all of which have been filed with the SEC): 

On August 4, 2023, we entered into a Fifth Amendment that
waived a default caused by our failure to meet the required Fixed Coverage Charge Ratio for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023.
Additionally, the amendment provided for a revised Fixed Coverage Charge Ratio for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2023 and September
30, 2023 and increased the amount of purchase money secured debt (or finance leases) we are allowed to have outstanding at any time to
 2,000,000. In connection with this amendment, we paid a fee of 10,000. 

26 

On November 20, 2023, we entered into a Sixth Amendment that
waived defaults caused by our failure to achieve the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Fifth Amendment and because we made capital expenditures
(as defined) in excess of permitted amounts. This amendment further revised the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio by requiring it to be calculated
on a rolling period basis and not be less than, (a) 1.10x (as calculated on a six-months basis) for the fiscal quarter ending March 31,
2024, (b) 1.20x (as calculated on a nine-months basis) for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, and (c) 1.25 (as calculated on a
twelve-months basis) for all fiscal quarters beginning with September 30, 2024, until the Current Credit Facility expires. This amendment
also increased our ability to make additional capital expenditures up to a limit of 2,000,000 in any fiscal year. In connection with
this amendment, we paid a fee of 20,000. 

On May 31, 2024, we entered into a Seventh Amendment that
waived the default caused by our failure to achieve the required Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Sixth Amendment. This amendment further
revised our Financial Covenants. For the six months ending June 30, 2024 our EBITDA shall not be less than 740,000; for the nine months
ending September 30, 2024 our EBITDA shall not be less than 1,500,000; for the twelve months ending December 31, 2024 our EBITDA shall
not be less than 2,800,000. For the rolling twelve month period ending March 31, 2025, we are required to achieve a Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio of 1.05x. Beginning with the rolling twelve month period ending June 30, 2025 and going forward the Company is required to achieve
a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25x. All other covenants remain unchanged. Additionally, this amendment increased the Term Loan by
approximately 1,000,000 to 5,700,000, with monthly principal installments in the amount of 68,000. In connection with these changes,
the Company paid an amendment fee of 20,000. 

In addition to required Term Loan payments of
approximately 204,000 for the remainder of fiscal 2024, we may have to make additional payments. For so long as the Term Loan under the
Current Credit Facility remains outstanding, if Excess Cash Flow (as defined) is a positive amount for any fiscal year, we are obligated
to pay an amount equal to the lesser of (i) twenty-five percent (25 of the Excess Cash Flow and (ii) the outstanding principal balance
of the Term Loan. Such payment shall be applied to the outstanding principal balance of the Term loan, on or prior to the April 15 immediately
following such fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, based on the calculation there was no Excess Cash Flow payment
required. 

In addition to the outstanding indebtedness under
the Current Credit Facility and Related Party Notes, we have various equipment leases and contractual obligations of an ongoing nature
which we service in the ordinary course out of our cash flow from operations. 

Our material cash requirements are for debt service,
capital expenditures and working capital. We have historically met these requirements with funds provided by a combination of cash generated
from operating activities and cash generated from equity and debt financing transactions. Although navigating the current business landscape
remains challenging and it is difficult to predict period-to-period financial performance, based on our current revenue visibility and
the strength of our backlog, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations for the next twelve months from
the date of issuance of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. However, if we were to default
under our Current Credit Facility and were unable to obtain a waiver from our lender and it was to cease lending we would not be able
to meet our financial obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the amount outstanding under our Revolving Line of Credit was 11,437,000,
leaving 8,563,000 of availability to support our growth, subject to having the requisite collateral and maintaining compliance with
the terms of the Credit Facility.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 508,000
of cash flows from operations as compared to 7,093,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction was due primarily
to the use of a portion of customer deposits which had been advanced in 2023 for the procurement of long lead time raw materials expected
to be utilized during 2024. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated cash of
 7,093,000 from operations which was mainly attributable to a substantial decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in customer
deposits. 

Cash Used in Investing Activities 

During the first nine months of 2024, we continued
to make investments to enhance our competitiveness and market position. Cash used in investing activities of 1,493,000 and 1,867,000,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was for new property and equipment. Investments in 2024 and 2023
increased our production efficiency and speed, while enabling us to maintain closer tolerances. They also expanded the size of products
we can manufacture. 

During fiscal 2024, we expect to continue to make
strategic investments in capital equipment to enhance our competitiveness. We expect to invest approximately an additional 750,000 during
the remainder of 2024 for new or upgraded equipment. 

Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
cash provided by financing activities was 825,000. During this period, we increased borrowings under our Current Credit Facility by 974,000
(consisting of a net increase in Revolving Loan borrowings of 633,000 and a net increase in our Term Loan of 341,000). We also made
payments of 143,000 pursuant to financing lease obligations and 6,000 on a loan payable. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
cash used in financing activities was 4,767,000. During this period, we decreased our borrowings under our Current Credit Facility by
 5,784,000 (consisting of a net decrease in Revolving Loan borrowings of 4,908,000, and a net decrease of 876,000 in the Term Loan).We
also made payments of 84,000 pursuant to financing lease obligations and 7,000 on a loan payable. Additionally, there were advances
totaling 393,000 taken on our financing agreement from CT Green Bank.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
as of September 30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

A critical accounting estimate is one that is
both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most
difficult, subjective or complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. 

Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The financial statements include estimates based
on currently available information and our judgment as to the outcome of future conditions and circumstances. Significant estimates in
these financial statements include, inventory valuation, useful lives and impairment of long-lived assets, income tax provision, and allowance
for credit losses. Changes in the status of certain facts or circumstances could result in material changes to the estimates used in the
preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions. 

There have been no material changes to the Company s
critical accounting estimates as compared to the estimates described in the 2023 Annual Report which we believe are the most critical
to our business and understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in
preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting refers to those policies, procedures
and processes that pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect transactions with respect to our assets; provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention and timely detection of unauthorized transactions with respect to our assets that
could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management relies upon the criteria established
in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)
in designing a system intended to meet the needs of our Company and provide reasonable assurance for its assessment. 

In connection with their review of our internal controls over financial
reporting as of the end of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024. As reported in our 2023 Form 10-K,
in connection with their review of our internal controls as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management identified a material
weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting related to our IT systems which has yet to be remediated. During fiscal 2023
and continuing in fiscal 2024, we implemented new controls and procedures to eliminate this weakness and are continuing to test their
effectiveness. Tests of such controls and procedures are ongoing and the material weakness noted will only be deemed to have been remediated
after the new controls and procedures have been in place for a sufficient period and management has concluded through appropriate testing
that the controls are operating effectively. For more information, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, included in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Except for the ongoing changes described above
intended to remediate the material weakness with respect to our IT System, there have not been any changes in our internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed
fiscal quarter which is the subject of this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
