 Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements 
 include, but are not limited to, statements related to our expectations, estimates, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, 
 anticipated events or trends, and similar expressions and statements that are not historical facts, including our expectations 
 regarding the performance of our business, our financial results, our liquidity and capital resources, contingencies, and our

 expects, potential, continues, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, predicts, intends, plans, 
 estimates, anticipates, or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements 
 are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause 
 actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements including, but not limited to, those 
 described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 
 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 22, 
 2024, as such factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC s 
 website at www.sec.gov. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other 
 cautionary statements that are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other periodic filings with the SEC. 
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 
 information, future developments, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

 Report on Form 10-Q and are not incorporated by reference herein. 
 Carlyle does not conduct any public solicitations (including print and online articles, advertisements, or postings on social 
 media sites, messaging applications such as Telegram, WeChat, or WhatsApp, or other public platforms) with respect to 
 investments, fundraising, cryptocurrency, or opening accounts on social media sites. Any investment-related communication 
 received from these platforms purporting to be from a Carlyle professional is fraudulent and should be reported to authorities. 

On January 1, 2020, we completed our conversion from a Delaware limited partnership named The Carlyle Group L.P. 
 into a Delaware Corporation named The Carlyle Group Inc. (the conversion, together with such restructuring steps and related 
 transactions, the Conversion ). 
 Unless the context suggests otherwise, references in this report to Carlyle, the Company, we, us and our refer 
 to The Carlyle Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we refer to our senior Carlyle professionals, we are 
 referring to the partner-level personnel of our firm. References in this report to the ownership of the senior Carlyle 
 professionals include the ownership of personal planning vehicles of these individuals. When we refer to the Carlyle Holdings 
 partnerships or Carlyle Holdings, we are referring to Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P., and Carlyle Holdings 
 III L.P., which prior to the Conversion were the holding partnerships through which the Company and our senior Carlyle 
 professionals and other holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units owned their respective interests in our business. 
 Carlyle funds, our funds and our investment funds refer to the investment funds and vehicles advised by Carlyle. 
 Carry funds generally refers to closed-end investment vehicles, in which commitments are drawn down over a specified 
 investment period, and in which the general partner receives a special residual allocation of income from limited partners, 
 which we refer to as carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Disclosures 
 referring to carry funds will also include the impact of certain commitments that do not earn carried interest, but are either part 
 of or associated with our carry funds. The rate of carried interest, as well as the share of carried interest allocated to Carlyle,

Table of Contents 

may vary across the carry fund platform. Carry funds generally include the following investment vehicles across our three 
 business segments: 
 Global Private Equity: Buyout, middle market and growth capital, real estate, infrastructure and natural resources 
 funds advised by Carlyle, as well as certain energy funds advised by our strategic partner NGP Energy Capital 
 Management NGP in which Carlyle is entitled to receive a share of carried interest NGP Carry Funds 
 Global Credit: liquid credit, private credit, real assets credit, and other credit such as insurance solutions, platform 
 initiatives, and capital markets; and 
 Global Investment Solutions: Funds and vehicles advised by AlpInvest Partners B.V. and its affiliates AlpInvest ), 
 which include primary fund, secondary and portfolio financing, and co-investment strategies. 
 Carry funds specifically exclude certain legacy Abingworth funds in which Carlyle is not entitled to receive a share of 
 carried interest, collateralized loan obligation vehicles CLOs ), our business development companies and associated managed 
 accounts, as well as capital raised from strategic third-party investors which directly invest in Fortitude (defined below) 
 alongside a carry fund. 
 For an explanation of the fund acronyms used throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, refer to Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Our Global Investment Offerings. 
 Fortitude refers to FGH Parent, L.P. FGH Parent ), the direct parent of Fortitude Group Holdings, LLC Fortitude 
 Holdings ). See Note 4 , Investments , to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly 
 Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding the Company s strategic investment in Fortitude. 
 Fee-earning assets under management or Fee-earning AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise from which we 
 derive recurring fund management fees. Our Fee-earning AUM is generally based on one of the following, once fees have been 
 activated: 
 (a) the amount of limited partner capital commitments, generally for carry funds where the original investment period 
 has not expired and for AlpInvest carry funds during the commitment fee period; 
 (b) the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital at cost, generally for carry funds and certain co-investment 
 vehicles where the original investment period has expired; 
 (c) the amount of aggregate fee-earning collateral balance of our CLOs and other securitization vehicles, as defined in 
 the fund indentures (pre-2020 CLO vintages are generally exclusive of equities and defaulted positions) as of the 
 quarterly cut-off date; 
 (d) the external investor portion of the net asset value of certain carry funds; 
 (e) the fair value of Fortitude s general account assets invested under the strategic advisory services agreement; 
 (f) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), excluding cash and cash equivalents, of one of our 
 business development companies and certain carry funds; or 
 (g) the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital, generally for AlpInvest carry funds where the commitment fee 
 period has expired and certain carry funds where the investment period has expired. 
 Assets under management or AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise. Our AUM generally equals the sum of 
 the following: 
 (a) the aggregate fair value of our carry funds and related co-investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts, 
 plus the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those funds and vehicles (including Carlyle 
 commitments to those funds and vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and employees) pursuant to the 
 terms of their capital commitments to those funds and vehicles; 

4 

Table of Contents 

(b) the amount of aggregate collateral balance and principal cash or aggregate principal amount of the notes of our 
 CLOs and other structured products (inclusive of all positions); 
 (c) the net asset value of certain carry funds; 
 (d) the fair value of Fortitude s general account assets covered by the strategic advisory services agreement; and 
 (e) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage) of our business development companies, plus the capital 
 that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those vehicles pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to 
 those vehicles. 
 We include in our calculation of AUM and Fee-earning AUM the NGP Carry Funds that are advised by NGP. Our 
 calculation of AUM also includes third-party capital raised for the investment in Fortitude through a Carlyle-affiliated 
 investment fund and from strategic investors which directly invests in Fortitude alongside the fund. The total AUM and Fee- 
 earning AUM related to the strategic advisory services agreement with Fortitude is inclusive of the net asset value of 
 investments in Carlyle products. These amounts are also reflected in the AUM and Fee-earning AUM of the strategy in which 
 they are invested. 
 For most of our carry funds, total AUM includes the fair value of the capital invested, whereas Fee-earning AUM 
 includes the amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital, depending on whether the original 
 investment period for the fund has expired. As such, Fee-earning AUM may be greater than total AUM when the aggregate fair 
 value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments. 
 Our calculations of AUM and Fee-earning AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers. As a result, 
 these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. In addition, our calculation of 
 AUM (but not Fee-earning AUM) includes uncalled commitments to, and the fair value of invested capital in, our investment 
 funds from Carlyle and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to management 
 fees, incentive fees or performance allocations. Our calculations of AUM or Fee-earning AUM are not based on any definition 
 of AUM or Fee-earning AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage or advise. 
 Performance Fee Eligible AUM represents the AUM of funds for which we are entitled to receive performance 
 allocations, inclusive of the fair value of investments in those funds (which we refer to as Performance Fee Eligible Fair 
 Value and their Available Capital. Performance Fee Eligible Fair Value is Performance Fee-Generating when the associated 
 fund has achieved the specified investment returns required under the terms of the fund s agreement and is accruing 
 performance revenue as of the quarter-end reporting date. Funds whose performance allocations are treated as fee related 
 performance allocations are excluded from these metrics. 
 Perpetual Capital refers to the assets we manage or advise which have an indefinite term and for which there is no 
 immediate requirement to return capital to investors upon the realization of investments made with such capital, except as 
 required by applicable law. Perpetual Capital may be materially reduced or terminated under certain conditions, including 
 reductions from changes in valuations and payments to investors, including through elections by investors to redeem their 
 investments, dividend payments, and other payment obligations, as well as the termination of or failure to renew the respective 
 investment advisory agreements. Perpetual Capital includes: (a) assets managed under the strategic advisory services agreement 
 with Fortitude, (b) our Core Plus real estate fund, (c) our business development companies and certain other direct lending 
 products, (d) Carlyle Tactical Private Credit Fund CTAC ), and (e) our closed-end tender offer Carlyle AlpInvest Private 
 Markets CAPM funds. 
 Legacy Energy Funds include Energy III, Energy IV, and Renew II and are managed with Riverstone and its affiliates. 
 The investment periods for these funds have expired and the remaining investments in each fund are being disposed of in the 
 ordinary course of business. The impact of these funds is no longer significant to our results of operations. 
 Metropolitan or MRE refers to Metropolitan Real Estate Management, LLC, which was included in the Global 
 Investment Solutions business segment prior to its sale on April 1, 2021.

reportable segments: Global Private Equity, Global Credit and Global Investment Solutions (see 
 Note 15 , Segment Reporting ). In the Global Private Equity segment, Carlyle advises buyout, growth, real estate, infrastructure 
 and natural resources funds. The primary areas of focus for the Global Credit segment are liquid credit, private credit, real 
 assets credit, and other credit such as insurance solutions, platform initiatives, and capital markets. The Global Investment 
 Solutions segment provides investment opportunities and resources for investors and clients through secondary purchases and 
 financing of existing portfolios, managed co-investment programs and primary fund investments. Carlyle typically serves as the 
 general partner, investment manager or collateral manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of 
 these products. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its 
 consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, certain Carlyle-affiliated funds, related co-investment entities and certain CLOs managed 
 by the Company (collectively the Consolidated Funds have been consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
 pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ), as described in Note 2 , Summary of 
 Significant Accounting Policies . The consolidation of the Consolidated Funds generally has a gross-up effect on assets, 
 liabilities and cash flows, and generally has no effect on the net income attributable to the Company. The economic ownership 
 interests of the other investors in the Consolidated Funds are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated entities in the 
 accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ). 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for 
 interim financial information. These statements, including notes, have not been audited, exclude some of the disclosures 
 required for annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements 
 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities 
 and Exchange Commission SEC on February 22, 2024. The operating results presented for interim periods are not 
 necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year. In the opinion of 
 management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, 
 which are necessary for the fair presentation of the financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods 
 presented .

billion and billion , respectively. As of December 31, 2023 , assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs 
 reflected in the consolidated balance sheets were billion and billion , respectively. Except to the extent of the 
 consolidated assets of the VIEs, the holders of the consolidated VIEs liabilities generally do not have recourse to the Company. 
 The Company s Consolidated Funds are primarily CLOs, which are VIEs that issue loans payable that are backed by 
 diversified collateral asset portfolios consisting primarily of loans or structured debt. In exchange for managing the collateral 
 for the CLOs, the Company earns investment management fees, including in some cases subordinated management fees and 
 contingent incentive fees. In cases where the Company consolidates the CLOs (primarily because of a retained interest that is 
 significant to the CLO), those management fees and contingent incentive fees have been eliminated as intercompany 
 transactions. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company held million of investments in these CLOs which represents its 
 maximum risk of loss. The Company s investments in these CLOs are generally subordinated to other interests in the entities 
 and entitle the Company to receive a pro rata portion of the residual cash flows, if any, from the entities. Investors in the CLOs 
 have no recourse against the Company for any losses sustained in the CLO structure. The Company s Consolidated Funds also 
 include certain investment funds in the Global Private Equity segment that are accounted for as consolidated VIEs due to the 
 Company providing financing to bridge investment purchases. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company held million of 
 notes receivable and investments related to these investment funds which represents its maximum risk of loss. The Company s 
 Consolidated Funds also include certain funds in the Global Credit and Global Investment Solutions segments that are 
 accounted for as consolidated VIEs due to the Company having a significant indirect interest in these funds via the Company s 
 investment in Fortitude (see Note 4 , Investments ). 
 Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities. Under the voting 
 interest entity model, the Company consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest. 
 All significant inter-entity transactions and balances of entities consolidated have been eliminated.

to of 
 limited partners capital commitments during the fund s commitment period. For closed-end carry funds in the Global Credit 
 segment, management fees generally range from to of limited partners invested capital. Following the expiration or 
 termination of the investment period, management fees generally are based on the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital 
 and the rate charged may also be reduced. These terms may vary for certain separately managed accounts, longer-dated carry 
 funds, and other closed-end funds. The Company will receive management fees during a specified period of time, which is 
 generally from the initial closing date, or, in some instances, from the final closing date, but such termination date 
 may be earlier in certain limited circumstances or later if extended for successive periods, typically up to a maximum 
 of . Depending upon the contracted terms of investment advisory or investment management and related agreements, 
 these fees are generally called semi-annually in advance and are recognized as earned over the subsequent period. 
 For certain longer-dated carry funds and certain other closed-end funds, management fees are called quarterly over the life of 
 the funds. 
 Within the Global Credit segment, for CLOs and other structured products, management fees generally range from 
 to based on the total par amount of assets or the aggregate principal amount of the notes in the CLO and are generally due 
 quarterly in arrears based on the terms and recognized over the respective period. Management fees for the CLOs and other 
 structured products are governed by indentures and collateral management agreements. The Company will receive management 
 fees for the CLOs, generally five to after issuance, including after the CLO redemption date until all eligible assets are 
 disposed of or at such time the collateral manager waives fees at its discretion. Management fees for the business development 
 companies are due quarterly in arrears at annual rates that range from of capital under management to of gross 
 assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents. Management fees for CTAC are due monthly in arrears at the annual rate of 
 of the month-end value of the CTAC s net assets. Carlyle Aviation Partners funds have varying management fee arrangements 
 depending on the strategy of the particular fund. Under the strategic advisory services agreement with Fortitude, the Company 
 earns a recurring management fee based on Fortitude s general account assets, which adjusts within an agreed upon range based 
 on Fortitude s overall profitability and is due quarterly in arrears. Managed accounts across the Global Credit segment have 
 varying management fee arrangements depending on the strategy of the particular account. 
 Management fees for the Company s carry fund vehicles in the Global Investment Solutions segment generally range 
 from to of the vehicle s capital commitments during the commitment fee period of the relevant fund. Following the 
 expiration of the commitment fee period, the management fees generally range from to on (i) the net invested 
 capital, (ii) the lower of cost or net asset value of the capital invested, or (iii) the net asset value for unrealized investments. 
 Management fees for the Global Investment Solutions carry fund vehicles are generally due quarterly in advance and 
 recognized over the related quarter. The investment advisers to the CAPM funds are entitled to receive a monthly management 
 fee equal to on an annualized basis of the fund s net asset value as of the last day of the month.

 Investment in Fortitude 
 On November 13, 2018, the Company acquired a interest in Fortitude Group Holdings, LLC Fortitude 
 Holdings ), a wholly owned subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. AIG ). Fortitude Holdings owns of the 
 outstanding common shares of Fortitude Reinsurance Company Ltd., a Bermuda domiciled reinsurer Fortitude Re ). The 
 Company paid million in cash at closing and paid million in additional deferred consideration during the three months 
 ended March 31, 2024. In May 2020, the initial purchase price was adjusted upward by million in accordance with the 
 purchase agreement as Fortitude Holdings chose not to distribute a planned non-pro rata dividend to AIG, of which the 
 Company paid million in May 2020. The remaining million was paid during the three months ended March 31, 
 2024. 
 On June 2, 2020, Carlyle FRL, L.P. Carlyle FRL ), a Carlyle-affiliated investment fund, and T D United Capital Co., 
 Ltd. T D ), a strategic third-party investor, acquired a ownership interest and ownership interest, respectively, 
 in Fortitude Holdings from AIG. At closing, the Company contributed its existing interest in Fortitude Holdings to 
 Carlyle FRL, such that Carlyle FRL held a interest in Fortitude Holdings. Taken together, Carlyle FRL and T D had 
 ownership of Fortitude Holdings. In October 2021, Carlyle FRL, T D and an affiliate of AIG contributed the entirety of 
 their interest in Fortitude Holdings to FGH Parent, L.P. FGH Parent ), a newly-formed entity interposed as the direct parent 
 of Fortitude Holdings, in exchange for an equivalent ownership interest in FGH Parent. References to Fortitude prior to this 
 restructuring refer to Fortitude Holdings and refer to FGH Parent for subsequent periods. 
 In March 2022, the Company raised billion in third-party equity capital from certain investors in Carlyle FRL and 
 T D, and committed million from the Company for additional equity capital in Fortitude. In May 2022, Fortitude called

 the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million , respectively. Interest expense for the

at September 30, 2024 ). 
 Master Credit Agreement - Term Loans 
 The Company assumed liabilities under master credit agreements previously entered into by CBAM under which a 
 financial institution provided term loans to CBAM for the purchase of eligible interests in CLOs (see Note 3 to the consolidated 
 financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . Term 
 loans issued under these master credit agreements are secured by the Company s investment in the respective CLO as well as 
 any senior management fee and subordinated management fee payable by each CLO. Term loans generally bear interest at 
 SOFR plus a weighted average spread over SOFR on the CLO notes, which is due quarterly. As of September 30, 2024 , term 
 loans under these agreements had million outstanding. The master credit agreements mature in July 2030 and January 
 2031, respectively. 
 CLO Repurchase Agreements 
 On February 5, 2019, the Company entered into a master credit facility agreement (the Carlyle CLO Financing Facility 
 to finance a portion of the risk retention investments in certain European CLOs managed by the Company. Each transaction 
 entered into under the Carlyle CLO Financing Facility will bear interest at a rate based on the weighted average effective 
 interest rate of each class of securities that have been sold plus a spread to be agreed upon by the parties. As of September 30, 
 2024 , million million was outstanding under the Carlyle CLO Financing Facility. Additional borrowings may 
 be made on terms agreed upon by the Company and the counterparty subject to the terms and conditions of the Carlyle CLO 
 Financing Facility. 
 Each transaction entered into under the CLO Financing Facility provides for payment netting and, in the case of a default 
 or similar event with respect to the counterparty to the CLO Financing Facility, provides for netting across transactions. 
 Generally, upon a counterparty default, the Company can terminate all transactions under the CLO Financing Facility and offset 
 amounts it owes in respect of any one transaction against collateral, if any, or other amounts it has received in respect of any 
 other transactions under the CLO Financing Facility; provided, however, that in the case of certain defaults, the Company may 
 only be able to terminate and offset solely with respect to the transaction affected by the default. During the term of a 
 transaction entered into under the CLO Financing Facility, the Company will deliver cash or additional securities acceptable to 
 the counterparty if the securities sold are in default. Upon termination of a transaction, the Company will repurchase the 
 previously sold securities from the counterparty at a previously determined repurchase price. The CLO Financing Facility may 
 be terminated at any time upon certain defaults or circumstances agreed upon by the parties. 
 The repurchase agreements may result in credit exposure in the event the counterparty to the transaction is unable to 
 fulfill its contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the credit risk associated with these activities by monitoring 
 counterparty credit exposure and collateral values. Other than margin requirements, the Company is not subject to additional 
 terms or contingencies which would expose the Company to additional obligations based upon the performance of the securities 
 pledged as collateral. 
 The Company assumed liabilities under a master credit facility agreement previously entered into by CBAM (the 
 CBAM CLO Financing Facility, together with the Carlyle CLO Financing Facility, the CLO Financing Facilities to 
 finance a portion of the risk retention investments in certain European CLOs managed by CBAM see Note 3 to the 
 consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
 2023 ). The maximum facility amount is million , but may be expanded on such terms agreed upon by the Company and 
 the counterparty subject to the terms and conditions of the CBAM CLO Financing Facility. Each transaction entered into under 
 the CBAM CLO Financing Facility will bear interest at a rate based on the weighted average effective interest rate of each class 
 of securities that have been sold plus a spread to be agreed upon by the parties. As of September 30, 2024 , million 
 million was outstanding under the CBAM CLO Financing Facility.

 that would need to be paid if the funds were liquidated at their current fair values at September 30, 2024 . However, the ultimate 
 giveback obligation, if any, generally is not paid until the end of a fund s life or earlier if the giveback becomes fixed and early 
 payment is agreed upon by the fund s partners (see Note 2 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ). The Company had 
 million of unbilled receivables from former and current employees and senior Carlyle professionals as of September 30, 
 2024 related to giveback obligations. Any such receivables are collateralized by investments made by individual senior Carlyle 
 professionals and employees in Carlyle-sponsored funds. In addition, million have been withheld from distributions of 
 carried interest to senior Carlyle professionals and employees for potential giveback obligations as of September 30, 2024 . Such 
 amounts are held on behalf of the respective current and former Carlyle employees to satisfy any givebacks they may owe and

 professionals and employees are personally responsible for their giveback obligations. As of September 30, 2024 ,

 served on Authentix s board of directors. After a lengthy sale process, Authentix was sold for an aggregate sale price of 
 million . On August 7, 2020, certain of the former minority shareholders in Authentix filed suit in Delaware Chancery 
 Court, alleging that the Authentix board of directors, CGF III, and the Company breached various fiduciary duties by agreeing 
 to a sale of Authentix at an inopportune time and at a price that was too low. Plaintiffs seek damages for their percentage 
 ownership share of the hypothetical extra gain they allege could have been realized on the sale. Plaintiffs also seek 
 disgorgement of any profits received by the Company stemming from the sale. A trial before the Delaware Court of Chancery 
 was completed in early February 2024. A decision from the court is expected later this year, following post-trial briefing. The 
 former directors of Authentix are covered by indemnification from Authentix and an Authentix insurance policy. The 
 defendants expect to continue to contest the claims vigorously. 
 The Tax Receivable Agreement Matter 
 The Company came into existence on January 1, 2020, when its predecessor, The Carlyle Group, L.P. (the PTP ), 
 converted from a partnership into a corporation (the Conversion ). On July 29, 2022, an alleged stockholder of the Company, 
 the City of Pittsburgh Comprehensive Municipal Trust Fund (the Plaintiff ), filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, 
 alleging a direct claim against the Company for breach of its certificate of incorporation and a derivative claim on behalf of the 
 Company against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company. Plaintiff challenges the receipt, by certain 
 officers of the PTP and certain directors of the general partner of the PTP, of a right to cash payments associated with the 
 elimination of a tax receivable agreement in connection with the Conversion. Plaintiff is seeking monetary damages, restitution, 
 and an injunction preventing the Company from making any future cash payments for the elimination of the tax receivable 
 agreement in connection with the Conversion. By virtue of the derivative nature of the primary claims (i.e., that the claims are

million for litigation-related contingencies, regulatory examinations and inquiries, and other 
 matters. The Company evaluates its outstanding legal and regulatory proceedings and other matters each quarter to assess its 
 loss contingency accruals, and makes adjustments in such accruals, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
 management s best judgment after consultation with counsel. There is no assurance that the Company s accruals for loss 
 contingencies will not need to be adjusted in the future or that, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, the ultimate 
 resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the accruals that the Company has recorded. 
 Indemnifications 
 In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries enter into contracts that contain a variety of 
 representations and warranties and provide general indemnifications. The Company s maximum exposure under these 
 arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet 
 occurred. However, based on experience, the Company believes the risk of material loss to be remote. 
 In connection with the sale of the Company s interest in its local Brazilian management entity in August 2021, the 
 Company provided a guarantee to the acquiring company of up to BRL million million as of September 30, 2024 
 for liabilities arising from tax-related indemnifications. This guarantee, which will expire in August 2027, would only come 
 into effect after all alternative remedies have been exhausted. The Company believes the likelihood of any material funding 
 under this guarantee to be remote. 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 Carlyle s funds seek investment opportunities that offer the possibility of attaining substantial capital appreciation. 
 Certain events particular to each industry in which the underlying investees conduct their operations, as well as general 
 economic, political, regulatory, and public health conditions, may have a significant negative impact on the Company s 
 investments and profitability. The funds managed by the Company may also experience a slowdown in the deployment of

 advances accrue interest at the WSJ Prime Rate minus floating with a floor rate of as of September 30, 
 2024 and are collateralized by each borrower s interest in the Carlyle sponsored funds.

 Deferred consideration for Carlyle Holdings units relates to the remaining obligation to the holders of Carlyle Holdings 
 partnership units who received cash payments aggregating to per Carlyle Holdings partnership unit exchanged in

 using Level III inputs in the fair value hierarchy. 
 In connection with the Company s initial public offering, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement with the 
 limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships whereby certain subsidiaries of the Partnership agreed to pay to the limited 
 partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships involved in any exchange transaction of the amount of cash tax savings, if 
 any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax realized as a result of increases in tax basis resulting from exchanges of Carlyle 
 Holdings Partnership units for common units of The Carlyle Group L.P.

per share plus any 
 accumulated but unpaid dividends divided by an initial conversion price of per share, subject to certain adjustments. With 
 the approval of its board of directors, CSL has the option to redeem the BDC Preferred Shares, in whole or in part. In such case, 
 the Company has the right to convert its shares, in whole or in part, prior to the date of redemption. For both the three months 
 ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recorded dividend income of million . For both the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recorded dividend income of million . Dividend income from the BDC 
 Preferred Shares is included in interest and other income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The 
 Company s investment in the BDC Preferred Shares, which is recorded at fair value, was million and million as of 
 September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and is included in investments, including accrued performance 
 allocations, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. I n August 2024, to facilitate a proposed merger between CSL and 
 another Carlyle-advised BDC, the Company agreed to exchange its preferred shares into newly issued common 
 shares of CSL at a price equal to the net asset value per common share on the date of completion of a proposed merger 
 (compared to a current conversion price of per share as of September 30, 2024 ). The merger is subject to CSL 
 stockholder approvals, customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Assuming satisfaction of those conditions, 
 the merger of the BDCs and the exchange of the preferred shares are expected to close in 2025. As a result of the agreement, 
 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reversed million of previously recorded unrealized 
 investment income based on the net asset value of per common share of CSL as of September 30, 2024 . The ultimate 
 amount of unrealized investment income to be reversed will be determined based on the net asset value per common share of 
 CSL as of the closing date of the merger. 
 Senior Carlyle professionals and employees are permitted to participate in co-investment entities that invest in Carlyle 
 funds or alongside Carlyle funds. In many cases, participation is limited by law to individuals who qualify under applicable 
 legal requirements. These co-investment entities generally do not require senior Carlyle professionals and employees to pay 
 management or performance allocations, however, Carlyle professionals and employees are required to pay their portion of 
 partnership expenses. 
 Carried interest income from certain funds can be distributed to senior Carlyle professionals and employees on a current 
 basis, but is subject to repayment by the subsidiary of the Company that acts as general partner of the fund in the event that 
 certain specified return thresholds are not ultimately achieved. The senior Carlyle professionals and certain other investment 
 professionals have personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, the obligation of these subsidiaries in respect of this 
 general partner obligation. Such guarantees are several and not joint and are limited to a particular individual s distributions 
 received. 
 The Company does business with some of its portfolio companies; all such arrangements are on a negotiated basis. 

million and million for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was approximately and for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , 
 respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily comprised the 21 U.S. 
 federal corporate income tax rate, the impact of U.S. state and foreign income taxes, and disallowed executive compensation, 
 partially offset by non-controlling interest and equity-based compensation deductions. The effective tax rate for the nine months 
 ended September 30, 2024 also includes an increase related to other non-deductible expenses. As of September 30, 2024 and 
 December 31, 2023 , the Company had federal, state, local and foreign taxes payable of million and million , 
 respectively, which is recorded as a component of accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying 
 condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 regulators. With a few exceptions, as of September 30, 2024 , the Company s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2020 
 through 2023 are open under the normal three -year statute of limitations and therefore subject to examination. State and local 
 tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2018 to 2023 . Foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2011 to 
 2023 . Certain of the Company s affiliates are currently under audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.

 billion in shares of our common stock, effective as of February 6, 2024, which authorization replaced the Company s prior 
 million authorization. Under this repurchase program, shares of common stock may be repurchased from time to time in 
 open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing 
 and actual number of shares of common stock repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements and 
 price, economic, and market conditions. In addition to repurchases of common stock, the repurchase program is used for the 
 payment of tax withholding amounts upon net share settlement of equity-based awards granted pursuant to our Equity Incentive 
 Plan or otherwise based on the value of shares withheld that would have otherwise been issued to the award holder. The share 
 repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. As of

reportable segments:

 capital funds, its U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, and its infrastructure and natural resources funds. The 
 segment also includes the NGP Carry Funds advised by NGP.

reportable segments. The CODM also uses DE in 
 budgeting, forecasting, and the overall management of the Company s segments. The CODM believes that reporting DE is 
 helpful to understanding the Company s business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure 
 that the CODM uses to analyze the Company s segment performance. DE is intended to show the amount of net realized 
 earnings without the effects of the consolidation of the Consolidated Funds. DE is derived from the Company s segment 
 reported results and is used to assess performance. 
 Distributable Earnings differs from income (loss) before provision for income taxes computed in accordance with U.S. 
 GAAP in that it includes certain tax expenses associated with certain foreign performance revenues (comprised of performance 
 allocations and incentive fees), and does not include unrealized performance allocations and related compensation expense, 
 unrealized principal investment income, equity-based compensation expense, net income (loss) attributable to non-Carlyle 
 interests in consolidated entities, or charges (credits) related to Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items that affect 
 period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of the Company s operational performance. Charges (credits) related to 
 Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items include: charges (credits) associated with acquisitions, dispositions or 
 strategic investments, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, amortization and any impairment charges associated 
 with acquired intangible assets, transaction costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions, charges associated with earn- 
 outs and contingent consideration including gains and losses associated with the estimated fair value of contingent 
 considerations issued in conjunction with acquisitions or strategic investments, impairment charges associated with lease right- 
 of-use assets, gains and losses from the retirement of debt, charges associated with contract terminations and employee 
 severance, certain general, administrative and other expenses when the timing of any future payment is uncertain, and non- 
 recurring items that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of the Company s operating performance. 
 Management believes the inclusion or exclusion of these items provides investors with a meaningful indication of the 
 Company s core operating performance. 
 Fee Related Earnings . Fee Related Earnings, or FRE, is a component of DE and is used to assess the ability of the 
 business to cover base compensation and operating expenses from total fee revenues. FRE adjusts DE to exclude net realized 
 performance revenues, realized principal investment income, and net interest (interest income less interest expense). Fee 
 Related Earnings includes fee related performance revenues and related compensation expense, which is generally of fee 
 related performance revenues. Fee related performance revenues represent the realized portion of performance revenues that are 
 measured and received on a recurring basis, are not dependent on realization events, and which have no risk of giveback. 
 Total assets by segment is not disclosed because this information is not used by the CODM to make resource deployment 
 decisions or evaluate the performance of the Company s segments.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Unless context suggests otherwise, references in this report to Carlyle, the Company, we, us, and our refer 
 to The Carlyle Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following discussion and analysis should be read in 
 conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q 
 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 Overview 
 We are one of the world s largest global investment firms that deploys private capital across its business and we conduct 
 our operations through three reportable segments: Global Private Equity, Global Credit, and Global Investment Solutions. 
 Global Private Equity Our Global Private Equity segment advises our buyout, middle market and growth capital funds, 
 our U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, and our infrastructure and natural resources funds. The segment 
 also includes the NGP Carry Funds advised by NGP. As of September 30, 2024 , our Global Private Equity segment had 
 169 billion in AUM and 104 billion in Fee-earning AUM. 
 Global Credit Our Global Credit segment advises funds and vehicles that pursue investment strategies including loans 
 and structured credit, direct lending, opportunistic credit, distressed credit, aircraft financing and servicing, infrastructure 
 debt, insurance solutions and global capital markets. As of September 30, 2024 , our Global Credit segment had 194 
 billion in AUM and 159 billion in Fee-earning AUM. 
 Global Investment Solutions Our Global Investment Solutions segment advises global private equity programs and 
 related co-investment and secondary activities. As of September 30, 2024 , our Global Investment Solutions segment had 
 84 billion in AUM and 51 billion in Fee-earning AUM. 
 We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for 
 transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a 
 performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, 
 which we refer to as a performance allocation, or carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by 
 the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ), we are required to consolidate some of the 
 investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that 
 deconsolidates these investment funds. Refer to Note 15 , Segment Reporting , to the condensed consolidated financial 
 statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the differences between our financial 
 results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes.

 Trends Affecting our Business 
 In the third quarter of 2024, global growth remained much more stable than many had feared, as monetary policy in most 
 developed market economies continued to ease. Labor market indicators in the United States softened as the Federal Reserve 
 initiated its easing cycle, while the European Central Bank (ECB) has now cut its deposit facility rate year-to-date by a 
 cumulative 75bps amidst uneven growth. India experienced slower economic activity and consumption growth, and China 
 continued to face uneven underlying growth as it attempted to stabilize property markets amid broader economic 
 transformation. Meanwhile, momentum in Japan slowed as the country navigated market volatility following the Bank of Japan 
 raising rates to the highest level in 15 years. By contrast, Korea s economy rebounded as the Bank of Korea initiated its easing 
 cycle following a second-quarter contraction. 
 In the U.S., official data suggest the economy grew at a 2.8 annualized rate in the third quarter of 2024 and U.S. 
 corporate margins continued to widen. Underlying growth was notably strong, with real consumption contributing nearly 2.5 
 percentage points to the headline number. Spending rose strongly across both goods and services, with certain durable goods 
 such as autos notching their strongest growth since the pandemic. Profit growth also remains strong: unlike 2020-22, when 
 profit growth was primarily a pricing power phenomenon, today it is mainly driven by productivity gains that have thus far 

73 

Table of Contents 

been underreported in official statistics. Lower base rates help as well; the Federal Open Market Committee s decision to 
 reduce the policy rate by 50bps in September responded to incoming data implying softening price pressures and a balancing 
 labor market. The unemployment rate temporarily rose to 4.3 in July the highest level since 2021 on increased labor 
 supply, before settling back to 4.1 by the end of the quarter, where it began. The Fed s preferred inflation gauge, the core 
 Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, has held steady, finishing August 2.7 above year ago levels. The Fed now 
 views the risks to achieving its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices as roughly in balance. Market 
 participants are generally in alignment with the Federal Reserve s September Summary of Economic Projections, but the recent 
 strength of the hard data has increased the market s assigned probability of a pause in cuts before year-end; futures quotes 
 currently imply slightly less than two full additional rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In Japan, momentum slowed but growth remained positive, with estimates indicating the economy grew at a 1.7 
 annualized rate in the third quarter. This performance occurred against a backdrop of market volatility. The Bank of Japan 
 raised short-term borrowing costs from the previous range of 0 to 0.1 to 0.25 in July, its highest level in 15 years, and 
 released a plan for tapering its asset purchases, signaling a pivotal shift away from a decade-long stimulus program. These 
 actions, paired with hawkish comments from policymakers and a disappointing string of economic data in the U.S., led to a 
 sharp appreciation of the yen, disrupting long-standing carry trades whose funding leg rested on Japan s low rates. The surge in 
 the currency value triggered a sell-off in Japanese equity markets. Liquidity pressures led to a sell-off far in excess of what 
 could be explained by any change in fundamentals. On August 5th, the Nikkei 225 fell 12.4 , while the TOPIX fell 12.2 , 
 their largest respective single day declines since 1987. This event underscored the relative illiquidity of certain listed markets 
 and how public market moves can diverge from underlying fundamentals, a distinction that is much less pronounced in private 
 market valuations. While both public and private markets in Japan have elements of illiquidity, private assets are not as exposed 
 to the sharp drawdowns that public markets experience during times of volatility. 
 In India, our proprietary portfolio data suggest the economy grew at a 5.9 annualized rate in the third quarter. Despite a 
 slowdown in consumption, the country appears set for a period of substantial catch-up growth and improvements in living 
 standards, supported by recent reforms in taxation, digital payments, and land use. With substantial required investments in 
 physical capital, the return on each unit of capital in India remains considerably higher than the rest of the world. In China, 
 domestic consumption data remained soft, with annualized growth implied by proprietary portfolio data falling below 2 for 
 the first time since pandemic lockdowns were lifted. While wage income has been growing at a 6 annualized rate, this has 
 been offset by losses on real estate, which continue to intensify. Recognizing the unsustainability of maintaining 4 to 5 
 industrial production growth in an economy where the domestic consumer absorbs less than half of this incremental output, 
 Chinese authorities announced a raft of policies in an effort to stabilize stock and property markets, boost consumption growth, 
 and attain broader growth targets. 
 Official data indicate Europe s economy expanded at a 1.5 annualized rate in the third quarter, but continued to 
 experience significant dispersion across regions and sectors. While shifting consumption patterns and higher finance costs have 
 softened demand for durable goods and business equipment, stagnant European industrial activity is explained mainly by 
 uncompetitive energy costs. After several months of gains to start the year, energy-intensive industrial output in Germany fell at 
 a -9 annualized rate in the third quarter, leaving it 16 below levels that prevailed prior to Russia s invasion of Ukraine. The 
 ECB enacted two additional 25bps cuts to its deposit rate, lowering it to 3.25 , with inflation falling below its 2 target. The 
 ECB is expected to continue a gradual reduction of borrowing costs as policymakers move towards a more neutral stance. 
 Earnings growth estimates for companies in the S P 500 remain significantly higher than in 2023, at an anticipated 9.3 
 for the year compared to 1 the previous year. Earnings are estimated to have grown by 3.6 in the third quarter of 2024, 
 compared to the same period a year ago, led by the information technology, health care, and communication services sectors. 
 The estimated blended net profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 was reported at 12.0 , roughly in line with the 12.2 
 margin observed a year earlier. 
 Despite a temporary spike in volatility and sharp pullbacks in July and early September, equity markets performed well in 
 the third quarter of 2024, buoyed by a broader range of stocks beyond the earlier concentration in the Magnificent Seven. The 
 Russell 2000 and Dow Jones led U.S. equity markets, returning 8.9 and 8.2 , respectively, while the S P 500 and Nasdaq 
 100 rose by 5.5 and 1.9 , respectively. In contrast to previous quarters, returns were more broad-based, and the Magnificent 
 Seven stocks accounted for just 0.5 percentage points (9 of the S P 500 s total quarterly gain . However, the forward price- 
 to-earnings ratio finished the quarter at 22.6x, which was roughly 20 above its 10-year average, as valuations continue to 
 stretch far beyond historically observed levels. Furthermore, despite the mega-caps relatively low contribution to aggregate 
 returns in the third quarter, these seven stocks have accounted for 50 of the S P 500 s return since 2021 and, as of September 
 30, make up 32 of total market cap. Global equity markets also performed well during the third quarter, particularly in China, 
 where the Shanghai Composite returned 12.4 , following stimulus announcements by Chinese authorities. Elsewhere, the 
 MSCI ACWI and EuroStoxx 600 returned 6.2 and 2.2 , respectively.

Global M A activity, driven by strong momentum in non-sponsored transactions, recorded 907 billion in volume in the 
 third quarter, 23 higher than the same quarter last year and a 12 increase over the previous quarter. Notably, this quarter s 
 M A volume was in line with pre-pandemic averages, reflecting a normalization in transaction levels. Year-to-date, total M A 
 volume stands at 2.6 trillion, a more than 20 increase relative to 2023, but still 16 below pre-pandemic levels. This growth 
 has been partially driven by notable increases in strategic M A in Europe, with year-to-date strategic deal values totaling 541 
 billion, a 23.9 increase from the comparable period last year. LBOs and related add-ons remained strong at 385 billion year- 
 to-date, a 36 increase relative to the same period a year ago, accounting for 18 of total M A activity, the second-highest 
 share recorded since 2008. 
 The effect of easier monetary policy is already evident in the U.S. IPO market. Excluding SPACs, 119 U.S. exchange- 
 listed IPOs raised 26.2 billion in the first nine months of the year, which is 30 more listings and a 50 increase in proceeds 
 relative to the same period last year. While the absolute value remains depressed and is still approximately 40 below the 
 capital raised during the first nine months of 2019, it is notable that follow-on transactions often seen as a leading indicator 
 for IPO sentiment are on the rise. 
 At 960 billion, U.S. institutional loan activity set an all-time record for the first nine months of the year. In the leveraged 
 loan market, spreads compressed to post-2008 lows as demand driven entirely by still robust CLO issuance (net loan fund 
 flows turned negative in the quarter) continued to outpace supply. When including high-yield bonds, full-year leveraged 
 finance issuance seems likely to exceed 1 trillion for only the third time in history. The main driver of this year s record- 
 breaking institutional issuance continues to be the boom in refinancing and repricing transactions. However, the third quarter 
 saw a notable step down in those volumes relative to the first two quarters of the year; in fact, non-refinancing activity in the 
 U.S. exceeded a third of total issuance for the first time since the second quarter of 2022. Sponsors also took advantage of 
 favorable credit market conditions to issue the second-most (leveraged) dividends on record. September volumes alone totaled 
 19.2 billion, the most for any month in the U.S. loan market by a wide margin. 
 Our carry fund portfolio appreciated 3 in the third quarter of 2024, our strongest quarterly appreciation since the second 
 quarter of 2022. Within our Global Private Equity segment in the third quarter, our corporate private equity funds appreciated 
 4 , driven by generally strong performance in the U.S. and Asia, buoyed by positive macro trends in those geographies and a 
 building exit pipeline. Our infrastructure and natural resources funds appreciated 2 in the quarter, reflecting stable commodity 
 prices, and our real estate funds appreciated 2 , benefiting from a cap rate environment that is still elevated but beginning to 
 thaw. Our Global Credit carry funds (which represent approximately 11 of the total Global Credit remaining fair value as of 
 September 30, 2024 appreciated 3 in the third quarter, while carry funds in our Global Investment Solutions segment 
 appreciated 2 in the third quarter. 
 Investment activity in our carry funds in the third quarter of 2024 generated realized proceeds of 6.8 billion , exceeding 
 invested capital of 3.9 billion and providing net positive distributions to our investors. As the recovery in deal activity 
 continues to gain momentum in the broader markets and the IPO market thaws, we expect to see increased activity in our carry 
 funds in the coming quarters. This activity includes our previously announced acquisitions of Worldpac, which closed on 
 November 1 , and Vantive, which is expected to close in late 2024 or early 2025, as well as the IPOs of StandardAero and 
 Rigaku in October. Recovery in deal activity in the broader markets is also reflected in the more than 80 increase in capital 
 markets fees in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 In our liquid credit strategy during the third quarter, we reset 2.8 billion in AUM across five CLOs, including 
 incremental fundraising of 0.2 billion , and refinanced one CLO. We generally seek to reset our CLOs to renew the 
 reinvestment period. In the absence of a reset, a CLO will begin to use cash flows to repay outstanding debt tranches, which 
 will reduce our AUM and Fee-earning AUM over time as the underlying collateral runs off. 
 Gross originations in our direct lending strategy totaled 1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, continuing a steady trend 
 of increases in gross originations since the second quarter of 2023, which was impacted by the slowdown in sponsor M A 
 activity in 2022 and 2023. Dividend yields on our business development companies and CTAC as of September 30, 2024 were 
 approximately 11 and 10 , respectively. 
 We had 8.8 billion in new capital inflows in the third quarter, and 26.6 billion year-to-date, towards our previously 
 announced target of 40 billion of capital inflows in 2024. Although investors are beginning to see net positive distributions in 
 certain asset classes, the impact of net negative distributions to investors over the last two years, combined with heightened 
 geopolitical risk and continued global economic uncertainty, has compounded an already challenging fundraising landscape. 
 While we believe that we will continue to attract a significant amount of capital for our buyout funds, we have seen a decline in 
 buyout fund sizes across most geographies, which may continue to result in lower management fees in Global Private Equity in 
 the future.

The SEC has put forth several rule proposals, and we are evaluating the potential impacts to our business and operations 
 and those of our portfolio companies. These proposals include, among others, safeguarding of advisory client assets for 
 registered investment advisers. In addition, the future of several final rules, such as the public company climate-related 
 disclosure rules and the private fund adviser rules, is in doubt pending the resolution of recent litigation. We are closely 
 evaluating potential impacts to our business of these rule proposals and adoptions and various financial, regulatory, and other 
 proposals put forth by the current and incoming Administration and Congress. The potential for policy changes may create 
 regulatory uncertainty for our investment strategies and our portfolio companies and could adversely affect our profitability and 
 the profitability of our portfolio companies.

Key Financial Measures 
 Our key financial measures and operating metrics are discussed in the following pages. Additional information regarding 
 U.S. GAAP measures and our other significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2 , Summary of Significant Accounting 
 Policies , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Revenues 
 Revenues primarily consist of Fund management fees, Incentive fees, Investment income (including Performance 
 allocations, realized and unrealized gains of our investments in our funds and other principal investments), as well as Interest 
 and other income. 
 Fund management fees . Fund management fees include management fees and transaction and portfolio advisory fees. We 
 earn management fees for advisory services we provide to funds in which we hold a general partner interest or to funds or 
 certain portfolio companies with which we have an investment advisory or investment management agreement. These fees are 
 largely from either traditional closed-end, long-dated funds, which are highly predictable and stable, or Perpetual Capital 
 products as defined below. Management fees also include catch-up management fees, which are episodic in nature and 
 represent management fees charged to fund investors in subsequent closings of a fund which apply to the time period between 
 the fee initiation date and the subsequent closing date. We also earn management fees on our CLOs and other structured 
 products. 
 Transaction and portfolio advisory fees . Transaction and portfolio advisory fees generally include capital markets fees 
 generated by Carlyle Global Capital Markets in connection with activities related to the underwriting, issuance and placement 
 of debt and equity securities, and loan syndication for our portfolio companies and third-party clients, which are generally not 
 subject to rebate offsets as described below with respect to our most recent vintages (but are subject to the rebate offsets set 
 forth below for older funds). Underwriting fees include gains, losses and fees arising from securities offerings in which we 
 participate in the underwriter syndicate. 
 Transaction and portfolio advisory fees also include fees we receive for the transaction and portfolio advisory services we 
 provide to our portfolio companies. When covered by separate contractual agreements, we recognize transaction and portfolio 
 advisory fees for these services when the performance obligation has been satisfied and collection is reasonably assured. We are 
 generally required to offset our fund management fees by the transaction and advisory fees earned, which we refer to as rebate 
 offsets. 
 The recognition of portfolio advisory fees, transactions fees, and capital markets fees can be volatile as they are primarily 
 generated by investment activity within our funds, and therefore are impacted by our investment pace. 
 Incentive fees . Incentive fees consist of performance-based incentive arrangements pursuant to management contracts, 
 primarily from certain of our Global Credit funds, when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark 
 returns or other performance targets. In such arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has 
 been achieved. 
 Investment income (loss) . Investment income (loss) consists of our performance allocations as well as the realized and 
 unrealized gains and losses resulting from our equity method investments and other principal investments. 
 Performance allocations consist principally of the performance-based capital allocation from fund limited partners to us, 
 commonly referred to as carried interest, from certain of our investment funds, which we refer to as the carry funds. Carried 
 interest revenue is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds investments above certain return 
 hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the 
 fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of carried 
 interest recognized as performance allocations reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds 
 underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. As 
 a result, the performance allocations earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period, as fair 
 values are based on conditions prevalent as of the reporting date. Refer to Trends Affecting our Business for further 
 discussion. 
 For any given period, performance allocations revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously 
 recognized performance allocations due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative 
 performance allocations earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized performance 

77 

Table of Contents 

allocations also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund s hurdle rate. Additionally, 
 unrealized performance allocations reverse when performance allocations are realized, and unrealized performance allocations 
 can be negative if the amount of realized performance allocations exceed total performance allocations generated in the period. 
 The timing and receipt of realized performance allocations varies with the lifecycle of our carry funds and there is often a 
 difference between the time we start accruing performance allocations and realization. The timing of performance allocations 
 realizations from our Global Investment Solutions, Carlyle Aviation, and Abingworth funds is typically later than in our other 
 carry funds based on the terms of such arrangements. 
 Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management teams of AlpInvest and Abingworth, the amount of 
 carried interest to which we are entitled varies. In some cases, we are entitled to 15 of the carried interest in respect of 
 commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020. In certain instances, carried 
 interest associated with the AlpInvest fund vehicles is subject to entity level income taxes in the Netherlands. Additionally, in 
 connection with the acquisition of Abingworth, we are entitled to 15 of carried interest generated from certain Abingworth 
 funds. 
 Realized carried interest may be clawed back or given back to the fund if the fund s investment values decline below 
 certain return hurdles, which vary from fund to fund. This amount is known as the giveback obligation. In all cases, each 
 investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. 
 Accrued performance allocations and accrued giveback obligations at a point in time assume a hypothetical liquidation of 
 the funds investments at their then current fair values. Each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried 
 interest and potential giveback obligations. These assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair 
 values of the funds investments until they are realized. The Company uses net accrued performance revenues to refer to the 
 aggregation of the accrued performance allocations and incentive fees net of (i) accrued giveback obligations, (ii) accrued 
 performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation, (iii) performance allocations and incentive fee related tax 
 obligations, and (iv) accrued performance allocations and incentive fees attributable to non-controlling interests. Net accrued 
 performance revenues exclude any net accrued performance allocations and incentive fees that have been realized but will be 
 collected in subsequent periods, as well as net accrued performance revenues which are presented as fee related performance 
 revenues when realized in our non-GAAP financial measures. Realized performance allocation-related compensation associated 
 with our updated compensation program that has not yet been paid is also excluded from our net accrued performance 
 allocations. 
 In addition, realized performance allocations may be reversed in future periods to the extent that such amounts become 
 subject to a giveback obligation. The aggregate amount of giveback obligations realized since Carlyle s inception totaled 
 242.3 million , 160.8 million of which was related to various Legacy Energy Funds. Given that current and former senior 
 Carlyle professionals and other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are responsible for paying the majority of 
 the realized giveback obligation, only 72.3 million of the 242.3 million aggregate giveback obligation realized since 
 inception was attributable to Carlyle. The realization of giveback obligations for the Company s portion of such obligations 
 reduces Distributable Earnings in the period realized. Further, each individual who holds equity interests in carried interest 
 generated by our funds and is a recipient of realized carried interest typically signs a guarantee agreement or partnership 
 agreement that personally obligates such person to return his/her pro rata share of any amounts of realized carried interest 
 previously distributed that are later clawed back. Accordingly, carried interest as performance allocation compensation is 
 subject to return to the Company in the event a giveback obligation is funded. Generally, the actual giveback liability, if any, 
 does not become due until the end of a fund s life. 
 In addition, in our discussion of our non-GAAP results, we use the term realized net performance revenues to refer to 
 realized performance allocations and incentive fees from our funds, net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals, 
 and other employees and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, 
 which are reflected as realized performance allocations and incentive fees related compensation expense. See Non-GAAP 
 Financial Measures and Segment Analysis for the amount of realized net performance revenues recognized each period 
 and related discussion. 
 Investment income also represents the realized and unrealized gains and losses on our principal investments, including 
 our investments in Carlyle funds that are not consolidated, and our strategic investments in NGP as described below, as well as 
 any interest and other income. Realized principal investment income (loss) is recorded when we redeem all or a portion of our 
 investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as dividends or distributions. A realized principal investment loss 
 is also recorded when an investment is deemed to be worthless. Unrealized principal investment income (loss) results from 
 changes in the fair value of the underlying investment, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains (losses) 
 at the time an investment is realized. 

78 

Table of Contents 

We account for our investments in NGP under the equity method of accounting. Our investments in NGP include the 
 equity interests in NGP Management Company, L.L.C. NGP Management and the general partners of certain carry funds 
 advised by NGP. These interests entitle us to an allocation of income equal to 55.0 of the management fee related revenues of 
 NGP Management, which serves as the investment advisor to certain NGP funds as well as 47.5 (40 or 42.75 in the case 
 of certain funds) of the performance allocations that NGP receives from the NGP Carry Funds. We record investment income 
 (loss) for our equity income allocation from NGP management fee related revenues and also record our share of any allocated 
 expenses from NGP Management, as well as expenses associated with the compensatory elements of the strategic investment. 
 We also record our equity income allocation from NGP performance allocations in principal investment income (loss) from 
 equity method investments rather than performance allocations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations . We do 
 not control or manage NGP. Moreover, we do not operate NGP s business, have representation on NGP s board or serve as an 
 investment advisor to any investment fund sponsored by NGP, nor do we direct the operations of any of NGP portfolio 
 companies. While we have consent rights over certain major actions by NGP outside of the ordinary course of NGP s business 
 (including, for example, consent rights over items such as amendments to the organizational documents of the entity in which 
 we are invested, changes to the management fee streams earned by NGP under its fund agreements, or the incurrence of certain 
 debt by NGP and other similar items), we have no voting rights or consent rights on any NGP investment committee that selects 
 investments to be made by NGP funds. For further information regarding our strategic investments in NGP, refer to Note 4 , 
 Investments , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Interest and other income . Interest and other income primarily represents reimbursement of certain costs incurred on 
 behalf of our funds as well as interest income that we earn such as from our cash and money market accounts and other 
 investments, including CLO senior and subordinated notes. 
 Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds . Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds primarily represents 
 the interest earned on assets of consolidated CLOs. 
 Net investment income (loss) of Consolidated Funds . Net investment income (loss) of Consolidated Funds generally 
 measures the change in the difference in fair value between the assets and the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. Income 
 (loss) indicates that the fair value of the assets of the Consolidated Funds appreciated more (less), or depreciated less (more), 
 than the fair value of the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. Income or loss is not necessarily indicative of the investment 
 performance of the Consolidated Funds and does not impact the management or incentive fees received by Carlyle for its 
 management of the Consolidated Funds. The portion of the net investment income (losses) of Consolidated Funds attributable 
 to the limited partner investors is allocated to non-controlling interests. Therefore, income or loss is not expected to have a 
 material impact on the revenues or profitability of the Company. Moreover, although the assets of the Consolidated Funds are 
 consolidated onto our balance sheet pursuant to U.S. GAAP, ultimately we do not have recourse to such assets and such 
 liabilities are generally non-recourse to us. Therefore, income or loss from the Consolidated Funds generally does not impact 
 the assets available to our common stockholders. 
 Expenses 
 Compensation and benefits . Compensation includes salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation, and performance 
 payment arrangements. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate. 
 We recognize as compensation expense the portion of performance allocations and incentive fees that are due to our 
 employees, senior Carlyle professionals, advisors, and operating executives in a manner consistent with how we recognize the 
 performance allocations and incentive fee revenue. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction 
 with the related performance allocations and incentive fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued 
 compensation and benefits liability. Compensation in respect of performance allocations and incentive fees is paid when the 
 related performance allocations and incentive fees are realized, and not when such performance allocations and incentive fees 
 are accrued. The funds do not have a uniform allocation of performance allocations and incentive fees to our employees, senior 
 Carlyle professionals, advisors, and operating executives. However, subsequent to the updates made to our compensation 
 strategy effective December 31, 2023, we generally allocate a range of 60 to 70 of performance allocations and incentive 
 fees to our employees. As a result, the portion of performance allocations and incentive fees paid as compensation has increased 
 and cash-based compensation and benefits has decreased in 2024 compared to the prior period. 
 In addition, we have implemented various equity-based compensation arrangements that require senior Carlyle 
 professionals and other employees to provide services over a service period of generally one year to four years in order to vest 
 in the applicable equity interests, which under U.S. GAAP will result in compensation charges over current and future periods. 
 In certain of our equity-based compensation arrangements, vesting is based on the achievement of certain performance targets 

79 

Table of Contents 

or market conditions (see Note 14 , Equity-Based Compensation ). Compensation charges associated with all equity-based 
 compensation grants are excluded from Fee Related Earnings and Distributable Earnings. 
 We may hire additional individuals and overall compensation levels may correspondingly increase, which could result in 
 an increase in compensation and benefits expense. As a result of prior acquisitions, we have charges associated with contingent 
 consideration taking the form of earn-outs and profit participation, some of which are reflected as compensation expense. 
 General, administrative and other expenses . General, administrative and other expenses include occupancy and 
 equipment expenses and other expenses, which consist principally of professional fees, including those related to our global 
 regulatory compliance program, external costs of fundraising, travel and related expenses, communications and information 
 services, depreciation and amortization (including intangible asset amortization and impairment), bad debt expense, and foreign 
 currency transactions. We expect that general, administrative and other expenses will vary due to infrequently occurring or 
 unusual items, such as impairment of intangible assets or lease right-of-use assets and expenses or insurance recoveries 
 associated with litigation and contingencies. Also, in periods of significant fundraising, to the extent that we use third parties to 
 assist in our fundraising efforts, our general, administrative and other expenses may increase accordingly. Similarly, our 
 general, administrative and other expenses may increase as a result of professional and other fees incurred as part of due 
 diligence related to strategic acquisitions and new product development. Additionally, we anticipate that general, administrative 
 and other expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the impact of foreign exchange transactions. 
 Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds . Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds consist primarily 
 of interest expense related primarily to loans of consolidated CLOs, professional fees and other third-party expenses. 
 Income taxes . Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying 
 amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax 
 assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax 
 assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be 
 realized. 
 Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities . Non-controlling interests in consolidated entities represent the 
 component of equity in consolidated entities not held by us. These interests are adjusted for general partner allocations. 
 Earnings Per Common Share . We compute earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per 
 Share . Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the common shares of the 
 Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share 
 reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Distributable Earnings . Distributable Earnings, or DE, is a key performance benchmark used in our industry and is 
 evaluated regularly in making resource deployment and compensation decisions, and in assessing the performance of our three 
 segments. We also use DE in our budgeting, forecasting, and the overall management of our segments. We believe that 
 reporting DE is helpful to understanding our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure 
 that management uses to analyze our segment performance. DE is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without 
 the effects of consolidation of the Consolidated Funds. DE is derived from our segment reported results and is an additional 
 measure to assess performance. 
 Distributable Earnings differs from income (loss) before provision for income taxes computed in accordance with U.S. 
 GAAP in that it includes certain tax expenses associated with certain foreign performance revenues (comprised of performance 
 allocations and incentive fees), and does not include unrealized performance allocations and related compensation expense, 
 unrealized principal investment income, equity-based compensation expense, net income (loss) attributable to non-Carlyle 
 interest in consolidated entities, or charges (credits) related to Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items that affect 
 period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of the Company s operational performance. Charges (credits) related to 
 Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items include: charges associated with acquisitions, dispositions, or strategic 
 investments, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, amortization and any impairment charges associated with 
 acquired intangible assets, transaction costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions, charges associated with earn-outs and 
 contingent consideration including gains and losses associated with the estimated fair value of contingent consideration issued 
 in conjunction with acquisitions or strategic investments, impairment charges associated with lease right-of-use assets, gains 
 and losses from the retirement of debt, charges associated with contract terminations and employee severance, and certain 

80 

Table of Contents 

general, administrative and other expenses when the timing of any future payment is uncertain, and non-recurring items that 
 affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of the Company s operating performance. We believe the inclusion 
 or exclusion of these items provides investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance. This measure 
 supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under 
 Consolidated Results of Operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Fee Related Earnings . Fee Related Earnings, or FRE, is a component of DE and is used to assess the ability of the 
 business to cover base compensation and operating expenses from total fee revenues. FRE adjusts DE to exclude net realized 
 performance revenues, realized principal investment income from investments in Carlyle funds, and net interest (interest 
 income less interest expense). Fee Related Earnings includes fee related performance revenues and related compensation 
 expense, which is generally approximately 45 of fee related performance revenues. Fee related performance revenues 
 represent the realized portion of performance revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis, are not dependent 
 on realization events, and which have no risk of giveback. 
 Operating Metrics 
 We monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the asset management industry. 
 Fee-earning Assets under Management. Fee-earning assets under management or Fee-earning AUM refers to the assets 
 we manage or advise from which we derive recurring fund management fees. Our Fee-earning AUM is generally based on one 
 of the following, once fees have been activated: 
 (a) the amount of limited partner capital commitments, generally for carry funds where the original investment period 
 has not expired and for AlpInvest carry funds during the commitment fee period (see Fee-earning AUM based on 
 capital commitments in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); 
 (b) the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital at cost, generally for carry funds and certain co- 
 investment vehicles where the original investment period has expired (see Fee-earning AUM based on invested 
 capital in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); 
 (c) the amount of aggregate fee-earning collateral balance at par of our CLOs and other securitization vehicles, as 
 defined in the fund indentures (pre-2020 CLO vintages are generally exclusive of equities and defaulted positions) 
 as of the quarterly cut-off date; 
 (d) the external investor portion of the net asset value of certain carry funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on net 
 asset value in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); 
 (e) the fair value of Fortitude s general account assets invested under the strategic advisory services agreement (see 
 Fee-earning AUM based on fair value and other in the table below); 
 (f) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), excluding cash and cash equivalents, of one of our 
 business development companies and certain carry funds (included in Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost 
 or fair value and other in the table below); and 
 (g) the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital, generally for AlpInvest carry funds where the commitment fee 
 period has expired and certain carry funds where the investment period has expired, (included in Fee-earning 
 AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other in the table below).

(1) Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based on 
 commitments were activated during the period, the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are based 
 on invested capital, the fee-earning collateral balance of new CLO issuances, closed reinsurance transactions at Fortitude, as well as 
 gross subscriptions in our vehicles for which management fees are based on net asset value. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during 
 the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM. Inflows for the nine months 
 ended September 30, 2023 include 2.4 billion of Fee-earning AUM related to closed reinsurance transactions at Fortitude. 
 (2) Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair 
 value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has 
 expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, and outflows 
 from our liquid credit products. Distributions for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do not affect 
 Fee-earning AUM. 
 (3) Market Activity Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the lower 
 of cost or fair value and net asset value, activity of funds with fees based on gross asset value, and changes in the fair value of Fortitude s 
 general account assets covered by the strategic advisory services agreement. 
 (4) Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated 
 funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the 
 period end. 
 Refer to Segment Analysis for a detailed discussion by segment of the activity affecting Fee-earning AUM for each 
 of the periods presented by segment. 
 Assets under Management . Assets under management or AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise. Our AUM 
 generally equals the sum of the following: 
 (a) the aggregate fair value of our carry funds and related co-investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts, plus 
 the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those funds and vehicles (including Carlyle commitments to 
 those funds and vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and employees) pursuant to the terms of their capital 
 commitments to those funds and vehicles; 
 (b) the amount of aggregate collateral balance and principal cash at par or aggregate principal amount of the notes of our 
 CLOs and other structured products (inclusive of all positions); 
 (c) the net asset value of certain carry funds; 
 (d) the fair value of Fortitude s general account assets invested under the strategic advisory services agreement; and 
 (e) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage) of our business development companies, plus the capital that 
 Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those vehicles pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those 
 vehicles. 

83 

Table of Contents 

The chart below presents Total AUM by segment at each period, in bil lions. 

We include in our calculation of AUM and Fee-earning AUM the NGP Energy Funds that are advised by NGP. Our 
 calculation of AUM also includes third-party capital raised for the investment in Fortitude through a Carlyle-affiliated 
 investment fund and from strategic investors who directly invest in Fortitude alongside the fund. The AUM and Fee-earning 
 AUM related to the strategic advisory services agreement with Fortitude is inclusive of the net asset value of investments in 
 Carlyle products. These amounts are also reflected in the AUM and Fee-earning AUM of the strategy in which they are 
 invested. 
 For most of our Global Private Equity and Global Investment Solutions carry funds, total AUM includes the fair value of 
 the capital invested, whereas Fee-earning AUM includes the amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of 
 invested capital, depending on whether the original investment period for the fund has expired. As such, Fee-earning AUM may 
 be greater than total AUM when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments. 
 Our calculations of AUM and Fee-earning AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers. As a result, 
 these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. In addition, our calculation of 
 AUM (but not Fee-earning AUM) includes uncalled commitments to, and the fair value of invested capital in, our investment 
 funds from Carlyle and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to management 
 fees or performance allocations. Our calculations of AUM or Fee-earning AUM are not based on any definition of AUM or 
 Fee-earning AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage or advise. 
 We generally use Fee-earning AUM as a metric to measure changes in the assets from which we earn recurring 
 management fees. Total AUM tends to be a better measure of our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects 
 investments at fair value plus available capital.

(1) Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising and closed reinsurance transactions at Fortitude during the period. For funds or vehicles 
 denominated in foreign currencies, this reflects translation at the average quarterly rate, while the separately reported Fundraising metric 
 is translated at the spot rate for each individual closing. 
 (2) Outflows includes distributions net of recallable or recyclable amounts in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles, and separately 
 managed accounts, gross redemptions in our open-end funds, outflows from our liquid credit products, and the expiration of available 
 capital. 
 (3) Market Activity Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds and

 Please refer to Segment Analysis for a detailed discussion by segment of the activity affecting Total AUM for each

 Available Capital . Available Capital refers to the amount of capital commitments available to be called for investments, 
 which may be reduced for equity invested that is funded via a fund credit facility and expected to be called from investors at a 
 later date, plus any additional assets/liabilities at the fund level other than active investments. Amounts previously called may 
 be added back to available capital following certain distributions. Expired Available Capital occurs when a fund has passed 
 the investment and follow-on periods and can no longer invest capital into new or existing deals. Any remaining Available 
 Capital, typically a result of either recycled distributions or specific reserves established for the follow-on period that are not 
 drawn, can only be called for fees and expenses and is therefore removed from the Total AUM calculation. 
 Perpetual Capital . Perpetual Capital refers to the assets we manage or advise which have an indefinite term and for 
 which there is no immediate requirement to return capital to investors upon the realization of investments made with such 
 capital, except as required by applicable law. Perpetual Capital may be materially reduced or terminated under certain 
 conditions, including reductions from changes in valuations and payments to investors, including through elections by investors 
 to redeem their investments, dividend payments, and other payment obligations, as well as the termination of or failure to renew 
 the respective investment advisory agreements. Perpetual Capital includes: (a) assets managed under the strategic advisory 
 services agreement with Fortitude, (b) our Core Plus real estate fund, (c) our business development companies and certain other 
 direct lending products, (d) Carlyle Tactical Private Credit Fund CTAC ), and (e) our closed-end tender offer Carlyle 
 AlpInvest Private Markets CAPM funds. As of September 30, 2024 , our total AUM and Fee-earning AUM included 98.7 
 billion and 95.4 billion , respectively, of Perpetual Capital. 
 Performance Fee Eligible AUM . Performance Fee Eligible AUM represents the AUM of funds for which we are 
 entitled to receive performance allocations, inclusive of the fair value of investments in those funds (which we refer to as 
 Performance Fee Eligible Fair Value and their Available Capital. Performance Fee Eligible Fair Value is Performance Fee- 
 Generating when the associated fund has achieved the specified investment returns required under the terms of the fund s 
 agreement and is accruing performance revenue as of the quarter-end reporting date. Funds whose performance allocations are 
 treated as fee related performance allocations are excluded from these metrics. As of September 30, 2024 , our total AUM 
 included 231.3 billion of Performance Fee Eligible AUM.

Consolidation of Certain Carlyle Funds 
 The Company consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary 
 beneficiary of variable interest entities. The entities we consolidate are referred to collectively as the Consolidated Funds in our 
 condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024 , our Consolidated Funds represent approximately 2 
 of our AUM; 1 of our management fees for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 ; and less than 1 of 
 our total investment income or loss on an unconsolidated basis for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 respectively. 
 We are not required under the consolidation guidance to consolidate in our financial statements most of the investment 
 funds we advise. However, we consolidate certain CLOs and certain other funds that we advise. As of September 30, 2024 , the 
 assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds were primarily related to our consolidated CLOs, which held approximately 
 7.1 billion of total assets of the Consolidated Funds. The assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held 
 within separate legal entities and, as a result, the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us. 
 Generally, the consolidation of the Consolidated Funds has a gross-up effect on our assets, liabilities and cash flows but 
 has no net effect on the net income attributable to the Company and equity. The majority of the net economic ownership 
 interests of the Consolidated Funds are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated entities in the consolidated 
 financial statements. 
 The Consolidated Funds are not the same entities in all periods presented. The Consolidated Funds in future periods may 
 change due to changes in fund terms, formation of new funds, and terminations of funds. Because only a small portion of our 
 funds are consolidated, the performance of the Consolidated Funds is not necessarily consistent with or representative of the 
 combined performance trends of all of our funds. 
 For further information on our consolidation policy and the consolidation of certain funds, see Note 2 , Summary of 
 Significant Accounting Policies , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on 
 Form 10-Q.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 The following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our condensed consolidated results of operations for 
 the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The condensed consolidated financial statements have been 
 prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical periods presented; however, the consolidated funds are not the same 
 entities in all periods shown due to changes in fund terms and the creation and termination of funds. As further described above, 
 the consolidation of these funds primarily has the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest 
 and other expenses of Consolidated Funds, and net investment income (losses) of Consolidated Funds in the year that the fund 
 is initially consolidated. The consolidation of these funds had no effect on net income attributable to the Company for the 
 periods presented.

(1) Total increase in Fund management fees does not include our equity income allocation from NGP management fee related revenues. We do not control 
 NGP and account for our strategic investment in NGP as an equity method investment under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, Fund management fees associated 
 with NGP are included in Principal investment income (loss) in our U.S. GAAP results. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , no funds generated over 10 of total management fees. 
 Management fees attributable to Carlyle Partners VIII, L.P. CP VIII ), our eighth U.S. buyout fund, were approximately 11 
 of fund management fees recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . No other fund generated 
 over 10 of total management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Fee-earning assets under 
 management in our Global Credit and Global Investment Solutions businesses have grown 28 and 22 , respectively, over the 
 last twelve months, while Global Private Equity has decreased 4 . As a result, Fund management fees increased in Global 
 Credit and Global Investment Solutions and decreased in Global Private Equity, due in part to smaller buyout fund sizes in our 
 corporate private equity strategy. 
 Fund management fees include transaction and portfolio advisory fees, net of rebate offsets, of 25.1 million and 
 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and 75.1 million and 39.3 million for the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. These fees primarily comprise capital market fees generated by 
 Carlyle Global Capital Markets. The recognition of portfolio advisory fees, transactions fees, and capital markets fees can be 
 volatile as they are primarily generated by investment activity within our funds, and therefore are impacted by our investment 
 pace. See Trends Affecting Our Business for further discussion on our investment activity and broader market trends.

Performance allocations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the following: 
 In our Global Private Equity segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , performance 
 allocation accruals were primarily driven by appreciation in our CP VII fund, and to a lesser extent appreciation in 
 our CP VIII and CAP V funds, partially offset by the reversal of performance allocations in our CEP V and CP VI 
 funds due to portfolio depreciation. 
 In our Global Credit segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , performance allocation 
 accruals were primarily driven by appreciation in our credit opportunities funds . 
 In our Global Investment Solutions segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , performance 
 allocation accruals were primarily driven by appreciation in our secondaries portfolio finance and co-investment 
 strategies.

Table of Contents 

Performance allocations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included the following: 
 In our Global Private Equity segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the reversal of 
 performance allocations were primarily driven by CP VII, as preferred returns outpaced portfolio appreciation, and 
 the impact of portfolio depreciation in CP VI. 
 In our Global Credit segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , performance allocation 
 accruals were primarily driven by portfolio appreciation in our opportunistic credit funds. 
 In our Global Investment Solutions segment, performance allocation accruals for the three and nine months ended 
 September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by our secondaries portfolio finance and co-investment strategies. 
 See Trends Affecting Our Business for further discussion on the macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry landscape 
 and our investment activity. 
 Principal investment income . The decrease in Principal investment income for the three months ended September 30, 
 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in investment income in 
 our other Global Credit products related to a 48.5 million reversal of previously recorded unrealized investment income on our 
 investment in the BDC Preferred Shares due to the proposed merger between CSL and another Carlyle-advised BDC, which we 
 expect will result in higher fund management fees in CSL in future periods (refer to Note 9 , Related Party Transactions , to the 
 condensed consolidated financial statements for more information). The decrease was also driven by a decrease in investment 
 income related to our equity method investments in the general partners of certain carry funds advised by NGP, primarily 
 driven by lower portfolio appreciation in NGP XI and NGP XI I . The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 
 also included investment losses on our CLOs, primarily related to our U.S. CLOs, compared to investment gains in the 
 c omparable period . These decreases were partially offset by an increase in investment income from our carry funds. 
 The increase in Principal investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to th e nine 
 months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an investment loss of 104.0 million during the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2023 related to our equity method investment in Carlyle FRL, which was recorded as a result of the dilution of 
 our indirect ownership in Fortitude (see Note 4 , Investments , to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more 
 information), partially offset by a decrease in investment income in our other Global Credit products driven by the reversal of 
 unrealized investment income on our investment in the BDC Preferred Shares as discussed above, as well as a decrease in 
 investment income related to our equity method investment in the general partners of certain carry funds advised by NGP, 
 primarily driven by lower portfolio appreciation in NGP XI and NGP XII . In addition, other investment income in the nine 
 months ended September 30, 2023 includes an unrealized investment loss of 13.3 million associated with the remeasurement 
 of a corporate investment in equity securities, which was previously carried at cost, resulting from an observable price change 
 pursuant to ASC 321, Investments Equity Securities . 
 Interest and other income . Interest and other income decreased 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 
 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily driven by a decrease in the reimbursement of 
 certain costs incurred on behalf of Carlyle funds. Interest and other income increased 9.8 million for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily as a result of an increase in interest 
 income from higher yields on cash and investments in CLO notes. 
 Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds . Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds increased 27.4 
 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and 
 increased 98.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 
 2023 , driven in each period primarily by an increase in interest income from consolidated CLOs. Our CLOs generate interest 
 income primarily from investments in bonds and loans, inclusive of amortization of discounts, and generate other income from 
 consent and amendment fees. Substantially all interest and other income of the CLOs and other consolidated funds together 
 with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds 
 limited partners or CLO investors. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the 
 Company.

Expenses 
 Compensation and benefits . T otal compensation and benefits increased 1.2 billion for the three months ended September 
 30, 2024 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and increased 1.3 billion for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase for the three and nine months 
 ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in Performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation of 1.2 
 billion and 1.3 billion , respectively, and an increase in equity-based compensation of 57.2 million and 168.3 million , 
 respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash-based compensation and benefits of 60.1 million and 
 162.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. 
 Cash-based compensation and benefits . The decrease in Cash-based compensation and benefits during each of the three 
 and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the updates to our compensation program under which we pay 
 a greater portion of compensation from performance allocations. 
 Equity-based compensation . The increase in Equity-based compensation during each of the three and nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in restricted stock units granted in 2024. In February 2024, we granted 
 18.1 million restricted stock units, including 13.2 million restricted stock units granted to certain Carlyle professionals that are 
 subject to vesting based on the achievement of stock price performance conditions over a service period of three years. The 
 grant date fair value of the awards subject to stock price performance conditions was approximately 347 million and the three 
 and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include 54.8 million and 143.7 million , respectively, of equity-based 
 compensation expense related to these awards . Equity-based compensation related to these awards will decline in 2025 as the 
 recognition of expense for these awards is more heavily weighted to the earlier years of the service period. Such expense is 
 incurred regardless of whether the stock price performance conditions are achieved. In February 2023, we granted a total of 
 9.9 million restricted stock units to our personnel, including certain senior Carlyle professionals and other key personnel, as 
 well as an aggregate 6.8 million of time- and performance-based inducement equity awards in connection with the appointment 
 of our Chief Executive Officer. 
 Performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation . The increase in Performance allocations and incentive 
 fee related compensation expense during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by 
 accruals of Performance allocations on which the related compensation is based, as well as the increase in the proportion of our 
 Performance allocations used to compensate our personnel as part of an update to our compensation program, which was 
 effective December 31, 2023. 
 General, administrative and other expenses . General, administrative and other expenses increased 33.6 million for the 
 three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to an 
 increase in foreign translation adjustments of 29.8 million , reflecting a foreign exchange loss for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 compared to a foreign exchange gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the 
 movement in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar , as well as an increase in partnership expenses paid by the Company on behalf 
 of the Carlyle funds of 8.2 million . These were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of 14.1 million . General, 
 administrative and other expenses increased 41.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily driven by an increase in liabilities for litigation-related contingencies, 
 regulatory examination and inquiries, and other matters of 35.0 million , as well as an increase in partnership expenses paid by 
 the Company on behalf of the Carlyle funds of 10.9 million . These were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of 
 15.7 million . 
 Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds . Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds increased 59.5 
 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and 
 increased 140.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 
 2023 , primarily due to higher interest expense on the consolidated CLOs . The CLOs incur interest expense on their loans 
 payable and incur other expenses consisting of trustee fees, rating agency fees and professional fees. Substantially all interest 
 and other income of our CLOs together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated 
 Funds is attributable to the related funds limited partners or CLO investors. Accordingly, such amounts have no material 
 impact on net income attributable to the Company.

Provision for income taxes . The Company s provision (benefit) for income taxes was 173.1 million and 41.2 million 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and 264.5 million and 68.2 million for the nine 
 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was approximately 22 and 27 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and approximately 23 and 28 for the nine months 
 ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The effective tax rate for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 and 2023 primarily comprised the 21 U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, the impact of U.S. state and foreign income 
 taxes, and disallowed executive compensation, partially offset by non-controlling interest and equity-based compensation 
 deductions. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes an increase related to other non- 
 deductible expenses. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had federal, state, local and foreign taxes payable of 
 26.5 million and 46.9 million , respectively, which is recorded as a component of accounts payable, accrued expenses and 
 other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities . Net income attributable to non-controlling 
 interests in consolidated entities was 20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 29.7 
 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and 54.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as 
 compared to 90.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . These amounts are primarily attributable to the net 
 earnings of the Consolidated Funds for each period, which are substantially all allocated to the related fund s limited partners or 
 CLO investors, as well as net earnings from our Insurance Solutions business and certain other products that are allocated to 
 certain third party investors. These amounts also reflect the net income attributable to non-controlling interests in carried 
 interest, giveback obligations, and cash held for carried interest distributions. The net income (loss) of our Consolidated Funds, 
 after eliminations, was 8.3 million and 20.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, 
 and 16.7 million and 68.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following tables set forth information in the format used by management when making resource deployment 
 decisions and in assessing performance of our segments. These Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for the three and 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Our Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effects of unrealized 
 performance allocations net of related compensation expense, unrealized principal investment income, consolidated funds, 
 acquisition and disposition-related items including amortization and any impairment charges of acquired intangible assets and 
 contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs, impairment charges associated with lease right-of-use assets, charges 
 associated with equity-based compensation, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, corporate actions and infrequently 
 occurring or unusual events.

Segment Analysis 
 Discussed below is our DE and FRE for our segments for the periods presented. Our segment information is reflected in 
 the manner used by our chief operating decision maker to make operating and compensation decisions, assess performance and 
 allocate resources. 
 For segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are presented on a basis that deconsolidates our Consolidated 
 Funds. As a result, segment revenues from management fees, realized performance revenues and realized principal investment 
 income (loss) are different than those presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis because these revenues recognized in 
 certain segments are received from Consolidated Funds and are eliminated in consolidation when presented on a consolidated 
 U.S. GAAP basis. Furthermore, segment expenses are different than related amounts presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP 
 basis due to the exclusion of fund expenses that are paid by the Consolidated Funds. Our realigned compensation program 
 positively impacted Fee Related Earnings and reduced the portion of realized performance revenues retained by the Company in 
 the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

(132.9) 

The decrease in fund management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three 
 and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the impact of investment realizations in funds on which 
 management fees are based on invested capital, a step-down in CP VII, and a decrease in catch-up management fees primarily 
 related to CP VIII, which completed fundraising in the third quarter of 2023 . The impact of smaller buyout funds in our 
 corporate private equity strategy is resulting in, and may continue to result in, lower fund management fees relative to 2023. 
 The decrease in fee related performance revenues for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as 
 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to CPI, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
 based on fund performance . The portion of these fees paid as compensation are included in cash-based compensation and 
 benefits expense. We do not expect material fee related performance revenues in Global Private Equity for the remainder of 
 2024 . 
 Cash-based compensation and benefits expense . Cash-based compensation and benefits expense decreased 41.2 million 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and decreased 
 150.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , 
 primarily due to a decrease in the portion of bonuses funded by fee earnings as a result of the updates to our compensation 
 program effective as of December 31, 2023, which resulted in a larger portion of compensation being derived from Realized 
 performance revenues related compensation. Additionally, the decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 
 further impacted by a decrease in fee related performance compensation of 26.8 million. 
 General, administrative and other indirect expenses . General, administrative and other indirect expenses increased 2.5 
 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . General, 
 administrative and other indirect expenses decreased 24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared 
 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to lower professional fees, and the benefit of lower VAT expense 
 in Asia.

(1) Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based 
 on commitments were activated during the period, and the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees 
 are based on invested capital. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which 
 are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM. 
 (2) Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair 
 value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has 
 expired during the period, and reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees. Realizations for funds earning management fees 
 based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM. 
 (3) Market Activity Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the 
 lower of cost or fair value. 
 (4) Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated 
 funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the 
 period end. 
 Fee-earning AUM of 103.5 billion at September 30, 2024 was generally flat to 103.7 billion at June 30, 2024 , as 
 outflows of 1.4 billion , primarily from realizations in funds that charge fees on invested capital, offset positive foreign 
 exchange activity of 0.8 billion from the translation of our EUR- and JPY-denominated funds to USD and 0.5 billion of 
 inflows primarily from additional fee-paying capital raised in NGP XIII and CAP VI . Investment and distribution activity has 
 no impact for funds still in the original investment period where Fee-earning AUM is based on commitments.

 and our U.S. buyout and U.S. real estate funds, as a well as a fee basis step-down in CAP V, outpaced 5.7 billion of inflows 
 primarily from the activation of fees in CAP VI, fee-paying capital raised in NGP XIII and CRSEF II, and investments in CPI. 
 The segment annualized management fee rate decreased to 1.15 at September 30, 2024 from 1.20 at September 30, 2023 ,

 reflected as fee related performance revenues when realized, and included in Fund level fee revenues in our segment results. There were no 
 accrued fee related performance revenues for CPI as of September 30, 2024. 
 The IRR is incalculable, which occurs in instances when a distribution occurs prior to a Limited Partner capital contribution due to the use 
 of fund-level credit facilities. 
 (1) Represents the original cost of investments since inception of the fund. 
 (2) Represents all realized proceeds since inception of the fund. 
 (3) Represents remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, and may include remaining 
 escrow values for realized investments. 
 (4) Multiple of invested capital MOIC represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, 
 divided by cumulative invested capital. 
 (5) An investment is considered realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and ceases to own an interest in, 
 the investment. An investment is considered partially realized when the total amount of proceeds received in respect of 
 such investment, including dividends, interest or other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at least 85 of 
 invested capital and such investment is not yet fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy involves 
 pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR, when 
 considered together with the other investment performance metrics presented, provides investors with meaningful 
 information regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of investments where significant realization 
 activity has not yet occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR have limitations as measures of 
 investment performance, and should not be considered in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that these measures 
 do not include the performance of earlier stage and other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided above. The 
 exclusion of such investments will have a positive impact on Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR in 
 instances when the MOIC and Gross IRR in respect of such investments are less than the aggregate MOIC and Gross 
 IRR. Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of other 
 companies that use similarly titled measures. 
 (6) Gross Internal Rate of Return Gross IRR represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested 
 capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, before the impact of 
 management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest. For fund vintages 2017 and after, Gross IRR includes the 
 impact of interest expense related to the funding of investments on fund lines of credit. Gross IRR is calculated based on 
 the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash 
 flows for the fund. Subtotal Gross IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for 
 each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund. 
 (7) Net Internal Rate of Return Net IRR represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested 
 capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, after the impact of all 
 management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest, including current accruals. Net IRR is calculated based on 
 the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash 
 flows for the fund. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and this blended return may differ 
 from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued performance revenues with a 
 blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund. Subtotal Net IRR aggregations for multiple funds 
 are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a 
 Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund. 
 (8) Represents the net accrued performance revenue balance/(giveback obligation) as of the current quarter end. 
 (9) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried 
 interest.

Realized Net Performance Revenues . Realized net performance revenues increased 3.3 million for the three months 
 ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Realized net performance revenues 
 decreased 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 
 2023 , primarily due to a decrease in realized net performance revenues generated by CCOF I and CSP II. 
 Realized Principal Investment Income (Loss) . Realized principal investment income (loss) decreased 10.8 million for the 
 three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily driven by 
 realized principal investment losses from the sale or redemption of certain firm-held investments during the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 to return capital that will be used to fund new growth initiatives, as well as lower realized investment 
 income in our liquid credit and direct lending products . Realized principal investment income (loss) increased 5.0 million for 
 the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily driven by 
 higher realized principal investment income from our credit opportunities funds and Europe CLOs, partially offset by the 
 realized principal investment losses during the three months ended September 20, 2024 discussed above. 
 Fee Related Earnings 
 Fee Related Earnings increased 34.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three

The increase in fund management fees for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 
 the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by closed reinsurance transactions at Fortitude, 
 which increased the fee basis under the strategic advisory services agreement, as well as increases from fundraising and capital 
 deployment in CTAC and CCOF III. 
 The increase in portfolio advisory and transaction fees, net and other for each of the three and nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase 
 in capital market fees. The recognition of capital markets fees can be volatile as they are primarily generated by investment 
 activity. See Trends Affecting Our Business for further discussion on our investment activity and broader market trends. 
 The increase in fee related performance revenues for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as 
 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to higher fee related performance revenues from 
 CTAC. 
 Cash-based compensation and benefits expense . Cash-based compensation and benefits expense decreased 4.8 million 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and decreased 
 19.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , 
 primarily due to a decrease in the portion of bonuses funded by fee earnings as a result of the updates to our compensation 
 program effective as of December 31, 2023, partially offset by higher fee related performance revenue compensation. 
 General, administrative and other indirect expenses . General, administrative and other indirect expenses increased 5.0 
 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and 
 increased 22.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 
 2023 , primarily due to increases in partnership expenses paid by the Company on behalf of the Carlyle funds, technology cost s, 
 professional fees (including legal expenses) , rent and office costs as the Global Credit segment continues to grow.

(1) Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based 
 on commitments were activated during the period, the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are 
 based on invested capital, the fee-earning collateral balance of new CLO issuances, closed reinsurance transactions at Fortitude, and 
 gross subscriptions in our vehicles for which management fees are based on net asset value. Inflows for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2023 include 2.4 billion of Fee-earning AUM related to closed reinsurance transactions at Fortitude. Inflows exclude 
 fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM. 
 (2) Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair 
 value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has 
 expired during the period, reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees, gross redemptions in our open-ended funds, and 
 outflows from our liquid credit products. Realizations for funds earning management fees based on commitments during the period do 
 not affect Fee-earning AUM. 
 (3) Market Activity Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in funds or vehicles based on the 
 lower of cost or fair value or net asset value, activity of funds with fees based on gross asset value, and changes in the fair value of 
 Fortitude s general account assets covered by the strategic advisory services agreement. 
 (4) Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated 
 funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the 
 period end.

(1) Represents the original cost of investments since the inception of the fund. For CSP III and CSP IV, reflects amounts 
 net of investment level recallable proceeds which is adjusted to reflect recyclability of invested capital for the purpose 
 of calculating the fund MOIC. 
 (2) Represents all realized proceeds since inception of the fund. 
 (3) Represents remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, and may include remaining 
 escrow values for realized investments. 
 (4) Multiple of invested capital MOIC represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried 
 interest, divided by cumulative invested capital. 
 (5) Gross Internal Rate of Return Gross IRR represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested 
 capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, before the impact of 
 management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest. For fund vintages 2017 and after, Gross IRR includes the 
 impact of interest expense related to the funding of investments on fund lines of credit. Gross IRR is calculated based 
 on the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment 
 cash flows for the fund. Subtotal Gross IRR aggregations for multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow 
 dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in 
 each fund. 
 (6) Net Internal Rate of Return Net IRR represents an annualized time-weighted return on Limited Partner invested 
 capital, based on contributions, distributions and unrealized fair value as of the reporting date, after the impact of all 
 management fees, partnership expenses and carried interest, including current accruals. Net IRR is calculated based on 

111 

Table of Contents 

the timing of Limited Partner cash flows, which may differ to varying degrees from the timing of actual investment cash 
 flows for the fund. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and this blended return may 
 differ from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued performance revenues 
 with a blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund. Subtotal Net IRR aggregations for 
 multiple funds are calculated based on actual cash flow dates for each fund and represent a theoretical time-weighted 
 return for a Limited Partner who invested sequentially in each fund. 
 (7) Represents the net accrued performance revenue balance/(giveback obligation) as of the current quarter end. 
 (8) For funds marked NM, IRR may be positive or negative, but is not considered meaningful because of the limited time 
 since initial investment and early stage of capital deployment. For funds marked Neg, IRR is considered meaningful 
 but is negative as of reporting period end. 
 (9) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as all active co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMAs), and 
 stand-alone investments arranged by us: SASOF IV, SASOF V, CAPF VII, CICF, CICF II, CAF, and CALF. 
 (10) Aggregate includes the following funds, as well as related co-investments, separately managed accounts (SMAs), and 
 certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us: CSP I, CSP II, CEMOF I, CSC, CMP I, CMP II, SASOF II, and 
 CASCOF. 
 (11) The fund stepdown date represents the contractual stepdown date under the respective fund agreements for funds on 
 which the fee basis stepdown has not yet occurred. Funds without a listed Fee Initiation Date and Stepdown Date have 
 not yet initiated fees. 
 (12) All amounts shown represent total capital commitments as of September 30, 2024. Certain of our recent vintage funds 
 are currently in fundraising and total capital commitments are subject to change. Committed Capital for CEMOF II 
 reflects original committed capital of 2.8 billion, less 1.1 billion in commitments that were extinguished following a 
 Key Person Event. Committed capital for CCOF II excludes 150 million in capital committed by a CCOF II investor to 
 a side vehicle. 
 (13) Funds are included when all investments have been realized. There may be remaining fair value and net accrued carry 
 where there are outstanding escrow balances or undistributed proceeds.

Fee Revenues . Fee revenues increased 31.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the 
 three months ended September 30, 2023 , and increased 72.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as 
 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , driven by an increase in Fund management fees of 26.0 million and 
 65.0 million , respectively, and an increase in Fee related performance revenues of 5.7 million and 7.2 million , respectively. 
 The increase in Fund management fees was primarily driven by the activation of management fees in the second half of 2023, 
 and the impact of ongoing fundraising in our most recent vintage secondaries portfolio finance and co-investment products . 
 Fund management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include catch-up management fees of 4.3 
 million and 6.6 million, respectively. The increase in Fee related performance revenues was primarily driven by growth in our 
 CAPM retail strategy.

(1) Inflows represents limited partner capital raised by our carry funds or separately managed accounts for which management fees based 
 on commitments were activated during the period and the fee-earning commitments invested in vehicles for which management fees are 
 based on invested capital. Inflows exclude fundraising amounts during the period for which fees have not yet been activated, which are 
 referenced as Pending Fee-earning AUM. 
 (2) Outflows represents the impact of realizations from vehicles with management fees based on remaining invested capital at cost or fair 
 value, changes in basis for funds where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has 
 expired during the period, and reductions for funds that are no longer calling for fees. Distributions for funds earning management fees 
 based on commitments during the period do not affect Fee-earning AUM. 
 (3) Market Activity Other represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the 
 lower of cost or fair value and net asset value. 
 (4) Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated 
 funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the 
 period end. 
 Fee-earning AUM was 50.9 billion at September 30, 2024 , an increase of 2.7 billion , or approximately 6 , compared 
 to 48.2 billion at June 30, 2024 , as inflows and the positive impact of foreign exchange were partially offset by outflows. 
 Inflows of 2.3 billion were driven by fee-paying capital raised and investment activity primarily in our secondaries portfolio 
 finance and CAPM retail strategies. Positive foreign exchange activity of 0.7 billion resulted from the translation of our EUR- 
 denominated AUM to USD. Outflows of 0.6 billion were driven by realizations across the segment in funds that charge fees

on invested capital or fair value . Distributions from funds still in the commitment or weighted-average investment period do not 
 impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital. 
 Fee-earning AUM was 50.9 billion at September 30, 2024 , an increase of 5.4 billion , or approximately 12 , compared 
 to 45.5 billion at December 31, 2023 , as inflows and market appreciation were partially offset by outflows. Inflows of 6.9 
 billion were primarily driven by fee-paying capital raised and investment activity across all strategies . Market appreciation of 
 0.8 billion was driven by certain funds in our secondaries portfolio finance and primary strategies in which fees are based 
 on fair value. Outflows of 2.4 billion were driven by realizations in our primary and secondaries portfolio finance funds that 
 charge fees on invested capital. 
 Fee-earning AUM was 50.9 billion at September 30, 2024 , an increase of 9.3 billion , or approximately 22 , compared 
 to 41.6 billion at September 30, 2023 , as inflows and market appreciation more than outpaced outflows during the period. 
 Inflows of 10.9 billion were primarily driven by commitments raised in our secondaries portfolio finance and co-investment 
 strategies and investment activity across all strategies. Market appreciation of 1.1 billion was driven by certain funds in our 
 secondaries portfolio finance strategy in which fees are based on fair value. Outflows of 3.5 billion were driven by 
 realizations in our primary and secondaries portfolio finance funds and step-downs in fee bases.

(1) Inflows reflects the impact of gross fundraising during the period. For funds or vehicles denominated in foreign currencies, this reflects 
 translation at the average quarterly rate, while the separately reported Fundraising metric is translated at the spot rate for each individual 
 closing. 
 (2) Outflows includes distributions in our carry funds, related co-investment vehicles and separately managed accounts, as well as the 
 expiration of available capital. 
 (3) Market Activity Other generally represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds, related 
 co-investment vehicles and separately managed accounts, the net impact of fees, expenses and non-investment income, as well as other 
 changes in AUM. 
 (4) Foreign Exchange represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated 
 funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the

 Total AUM was 83.7 billion at September 30, 2024 , an increase of 3.1 billion , or approximately 4 , compared to 
 80.6 billion at June 30, 2024 . The increase was driven by 2.3 billion of inflows related to fundraising primarily in our 
 secondaries portfolio finance and CAPM retail strategies, market appreciation of 1.5 billion primarily in our secondaries 
 portfolio finance and co-investment strategies, and 1.1 billion of positive foreign exchange activity from the translation of our 
 EUR-denominated AUM to USD. Partially offsetting the increase were outflows of 1.9 billion from realizations 
 predominantly in our primary and secondaries portfolio finance funds. 
 Total AUM was 83.7 billion at September 30, 2024 , an increase of 6.8 billion , or approximately 9 , compared to 
 76.9 billion at December 31, 2023 . Inflows from fundraising of 7.0 billion and market appreciation of 4.8 billion , both 
 driven by our secondaries portfolio finance and co-investment strategies, were partially offset by outflows of 5.1 billion 
 from realizations predominantly in our primary and secondaries portfolio finance funds.

(1) Includes private equity and mezzanine primary fund investments, secondary fund investments and co-investments 
 originated by AlpInvest. Excluded from the performance information shown are: (a) investments that were not originated 
 by AlpInvest (i.e., AlpInvest did not make the original investment decision or recommendation); (b) Direct Investments, 
 which was spun off from AlpInvest in 2005; (c) Carlyle AlpInvest Private Markets (CAPM); and (d) LP co-investment 
 vehicles managed by AlpInvest. As of September 30, 2024, these excluded portfolios amounted to approximately 7.8 
 billion of AUM in the aggregate. 
 (2) Represents the original cost of investments since inception of the fund. 
 (3) To exclude the impact of FX, all foreign currency cash flows have been converted to the currency representing a majority 
 of the capital committed to the relevant fund at the reporting period spot rate. 

117

(4) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried 
 interest. 
 (5) Multiple of invested capital MOIC represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, 
 divided by cumulative invested capital. 
 (6) Gross Internal Rate of Return Gross IRR represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner 
 invested capital based on investment contributions, distributions and unrealized value of the underlying investments, before 
 management fees, expenses and carried interest at the AlpInvest level. 
 (7) Net Internal Rate of Return Net IRR represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested 
 capital based on investment contributions, distributions and unrealized value of the underlying investments, after 
 management fees, expenses and carried interest. Fund level IRRs are based on aggregate Limited Partner cash flows, and 
 this blended return may differ from that of individual Limited Partners. As a result, certain funds may generate accrued 
 performance revenues with a blended Net IRR that is below the preferred return hurdle for that fund. 
 (8) ASF stands for AlpInvest Secondaries Fund, ACF stands forAlpInvest Co-Investment Fund, and SMAs are 
 Separately Managed Accounts. ASF - SMAs and ACF - SMAs reflect the aggregated portfolios of investments held by 
 SMAs within the relevant strategy, which invest alongside the relevant ASF or ACF (as applicable). Strategic SMAs reflect 
 the aggregated portfolios of co-investments made by SMAs sourced from the SMA investor s own private equity fund 
 investment portfolio. Other SMAs reflect the aggregated portfolios of investments within the relevant strategy that began 
 making investments in the corresponding time periods. Co-Investments SMAs 2014-2016 does not include two SMAs that 
 started in 2016 but invested a substantial majority alongside ACF VII. These two SMAs have instead been grouped with 
 ACF VII - SMAs. An SMA may pursue multiple investment strategies and make commitments over multiple years. 
 (9) Includes ASF VIII - SMAs, ACF IX - SMAs, AlpInvest Strategic Portfolio Finance II, AlpInvest Atom Fund, AlpInvest 
 Atom Fund II, all mezzanine investment portfolios, all clean technology private equity investment portfolios, all strategic 
 portfolio finance SMAs, and any state-focused investment mandate portfolios. 
 (10) For funds marked NM, IRR may be positive or negative, but is not considered meaningful because of the limited time 
 since initial investment and early stage of capital deployment. For funds marked Neg, IRR is considered meaningful but 
 is negative as of reporting period end. 
 (11) For purposes of aggregation, funds that report in foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the reporting 
 period spot rate. 
 (12) Represents the net accrued performance revenue balance/(giveback obligation) as of the current quarter end. Total Net 
 Accrued Carry excludes 0.4 million of net accrued carry as of September 30, 2024 , which was retained as part of the sale 
 of MRE on April 1, 2021. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historical Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically required limited capital resources to support the working capital and operating needs of our 
 business. Our management fees have largely covered our operating costs and all realized performance allocations, after 
 covering the related compensation, are available for distribution to stockholders. Approximately 95 97 of all capital 
 commitments to our funds are provided by our fund investors, with the remaining amount typically funded by Carlyle, our 
 senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals. We may elect to invest additional amounts in funds focused on 
 new investment areas. 
 Our Sources of Liquidity 
 We have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including cash on hand, annual cash flows, accumulated 
 earnings and funds from our senior revolving credit facility, which had 1.0 billion of available capacity as of September 30, 
 2024 . We believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. We believe we 
 will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of existing cash and cash 
 equivalent balances, cash flow from operations, accumulated earnings, and amounts available for borrowing from our senior 
 revolving credit facility or other financings. 
 Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents were approximately 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024 . However, 
 a portion of this cash is allocated for specific business purposes, including, but not limited to: (i) performance allocations and 

118 

Table of Contents 

incentive fee related cash that has been received but not yet distributed as performance allocations and incentive fee related 
 compensation and amounts owed to non-controlling interests, (ii) proceeds received from realized investments that are allocable 
 to non-controlling interests, and (iii) regulatory capital. 
 Corporate Treasury Investments . These investments represent investments in U.S. Treasury and government agency 
 obligations, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, other investment grade securities and other investments with original 
 maturities of greater than three months when purchased. 
 After deducting cash amounts allocated to the specific requirements mentioned above, the remaining cash, cash 
 equivalents, and corporate treasury investments, was approximately 1.3 billion a s of September 30, 2024 . This remaining 
 amount will be used towards our primary liquidity needs, as outlined in the next section. This amount does not take into 
 consideration ordinary course of business payables and reserves for specific business purposes. 
 Senior Revolving Credit Facility . The capacity under the revolving credit facility is 1.0 billion and the facility is 
 scheduled to mature on April 29, 2027 . The Company s borrowing capacity is subject to the ability of the financial institutions 
 in the banking syndicate to fulfill their respective obligations under the revolving credit facility. Principal amounts outstanding 
 under the amended and restated revolving credit facility accrue interest, at the option of the borrowers, either (a) at an alternate 
 base rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed 0.50 per annum, or (b) at SOFR (or similar benchmark rate for non-U.S. 
 dollar borrowings) plus a 0.10 adjustment and an applicable margin not to exceed 1.50 per annum 5.95 at September 30, 
 2024 ). As of September 30, 2024 , there were no amounts outstanding under the senior revolving credit facility. 
 The senior revolving credit facility is unsecured. We are required to maintain management fee earning assets (as defined 
 in the amended and restated senior revolving credit facility) of at least 126.6 billion and a total leverage ratio of less than 4.0 to 
 1.0, in each case, tested on a quarterly basis. Non-compliance with any of the financial or non-financial covenants without cure 
 or waiver would constitute an event of default under the senior revolving credit facility. An event of default resulting from a 
 breach of certain financial or non-financial covenants may result, at the option of the lenders, in an acceleration of the principal 
 and interest outstanding, and a termination of the senior revolving credit facility. The senior credit facility also contains other 
 customary events of default, including defaults based on events of bankruptcy and insolvency, nonpayment of principal, interest 
 or fees when due, breach of specified covenants, change in control and material inaccuracy of representations and warranties. 
 Global Credit Revolving Credit Facility . Certain subsidiaries of the Company are parties to a revolving line of credit, 
 primarily intended to support certain lending activities within the Global Credit segment. As currently amended, the Global 
 Credit Revolving Credit Facility provides for a revolving line of credit with a capacity of 300 million , which matures in 
 September 2027, and a second revolving line of credit with a capacity of 200 million, which matures in August 2025. 
 The Company s borrowing capacity is subject to the ability of the financial institutions in the banking syndicate to fulfill 
 their respective obligations under the Global Credit Revolving Credit Facility. Principal amounts outstanding accrue interest at 
 applicable SOFR or Eurocurrency rates plus an applicable margin of 2.00 or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin 
 of 1.00 . During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company made no borrowings under the Global Credit 
 Revolving Credit Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made borrowings of 5.0 million 
 and 5.0 million , which were repaid during the period . As of September 30, 2024 , there was no borrowing outstanding under 
 the Global Credit Revolving Credit Facility. 
 CLO Borrowings . For certain of our CLOs, the Company finances a portion of its investment in the CLOs through the 
 proceeds received from term loans and other financing arrangements with financial institutions or other financing arrangements. 
 The Company s CLO borrowings outstanding were 358.7 million and 431.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 
 December 31, 2023 , respectively. The CLO borrowings are secured by the Company s investments in the respective CLO, have 
 a general unsecured interest in the Carlyle entity that manages the CLO and generally do not have recourse to any other Carlyle 
 entity. As of September 30, 2024 , 338.0 million of these borrowings are secured by investments attributable to The Carlyle 
 Group Inc. See Note 6 , Borrowings , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on 
 Form 10-Q for more information on our CLO borrowings. 
 Senior Notes . Certain indirect finance subsidiaries of the Company have issued senior notes, on which interest is payable 
 semi-annually, as discussed below. The senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective subsidiary 
 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company and each of the Carlyle Holdings 
 partnerships. The indentures governing each of the senior notes contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit the 
 issuers and the guarantors ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or 
 profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The notes also 
 contain customary events of default. All or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any 

119 

Table of Contents 

time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the notes. If a change 
 of control repurchase event occurs, the notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the notes. 
 3.500 Senior Notes . In September 2019, Carlyle Finance Subsidiary L.L.C. issued 425.0 million of 3.500 senior 
 notes due September 19, 2029 at 99.841 of par. 
 5.625 Senior Notes . In March 2013, Carlyle Holdings II Finance L.L.C. issued 400.0 million of 5.625 senior notes 
 due March 30, 2043 at 99.583 of par. In March 2014, an additional 200.0 million of these notes were issued at 104.315 of 
 par and are treated as a single class with the already outstanding 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of these notes. 
 5.650 Senior Notes . In September 2018, Carlyle Finance L.L.C. issued 350.0 million of 5.650 senior notes due 
 September 15, 2048 at 99.914 of par. 
 Subordinated Notes . In May and June 2021, Carlyle Finance L.L.C. issued 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 
 4.625 subordinated notes due May 15, 2061. The subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinated obligations of the issuer 
 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by the Company, each of the 
 Carlyle Holdings partnerships, and CG Subsidiary Holdings L.L.C., an indirect subsidiary of the Company. The indentures 
 governing the subordinated notes contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit the issuers and the guarantors 
 ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness ranking on a parity with the subordinated notes or indebtedness 
 ranking junior to the subordinated notes secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their 
 subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease all or substantially all of their assets. The subordinated notes also 
 contain customary events of default. All or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any 
 time and from time to time on or after June 15, 2026, prior to their stated maturity, at a redemption price equal to their principal 
 amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. If interest due on the Subordinated Notes 
 is deemed to no longer be deductible in the U.S., a Tax Redemption Event, the subordinated notes may be redeemed, in 
 whole, but not in part, within 120 days of the occurrence of such event at a redemption price equal to their principal amount 
 plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, the subordinated notes may be redeemed, 
 in whole, but not in part, at any time prior to May 15, 2026, within 90 days of the rating agencies determining that the 
 Subordinated Notes should no longer receive partial equity treatment pursuant to the rating agency s criteria, a rating agency 
 event, at a redemption price equal to 102 of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, 
 the date of redemption. 
 Obligations of CLOs . Loans payable of the Consolidated Funds primarily comprise amounts due to holders of debt 
 securities issued by the CLOs. We are not liable for any loans payable of the CLOs. Loans payable of the CLOs are 
 collateralized by the assets held by the CLOs and the assets of one CLO may not be used to satisfy the liabilities of another. 
 This collateral consists of cash and cash equivalents, corporate loans, corporate bonds and other securities. 
 Realized Performance Allocation Revenues . Another source of liquidity we may use to meet our capital needs is the 
 realized performance allocation revenues generated by our investment funds. Performance allocations are generally realized 
 when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the fund s cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return. 
 For certain funds, performance allocations are realized once all invested capital and expenses have been returned to the fund s 
 investors and the fund s cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return. Incentive fees earned on our CLO vehicles 
 generally are paid upon the dissolution of such vehicles.

 percentage of return is calculated as: ending remaining investment fair market value plus net investment outflow (sales proceeds 
 minus net purchases) minus beginning remaining investment fair market value divided by beginning remaining investment fair 
 market value. Amounts are fund only, and do not include coinvestments. 
 (2) Includes 1.0 million of net accrued clawback from our Legacy Energy funds. 
 Realized Principal Investment Income . Another source of liquidity we may use to meet our capital needs is the realized 
 principal investment income generated by our equity method investments and other principal investments. Principal investment 
 income is realized when we redeem all or a portion of our investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as 
 dividends or distributions. Certain of the investments attributable to The Carlyle Group Inc. (excluding certain general partner 
 interests, certain strategic investments, and investments in certain CLOs) may be sold at our discretion as a source of liquidity.

 Our Liquidity Needs 
 We generally use our working capital and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, service our debt, fund the working 
 capital needs of our business and investment funds and return capital to our common stockholders in the form of dividends or 
 stock repurchases. 
 In the future, we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be to: 
 provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing business lines; 
 provide capital to facilitate our expansion into new, complementary business lines, including acquisitions; 
 pay operating expenses, including compensation and compliance costs and other obligations as they arise; 
 fund costs of litigation and contingencies, including related legal costs; 
 fund the capital investments of Carlyle in our funds; 
 fund capital expenditures; 
 repay borrowings and related interest costs and expenses; 

122 

Table of Contents 

pay earn-outs and contingent cash consideration associated with our acquisitions and strategic investments; 
 pay income taxes, including corporate income taxes; 
 pay dividends to our common stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy; 
 repurchase our common stock and pay any associated taxes; and 
 settle tax withholding obligations in connection with net share settlements of equity-based awards. 
 Common Stockholder Dividends . Under our dividend policy for our common stock, our intention is to pay dividends to 
 holders of our common stock in an amount of 0.35 per common share on a quarterly basis 1.40 annually), which 
 commenced with the first quarter 2023 dividend paid in May 2023. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay 
 generally will be treated as qualified dividend income (generally taxable to U.S. individual stockholders at capital gain rates) 
 paid by a domestic corporation to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. 
 federal income tax purposes, with any excess dividends treated as return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s basis. The 
 declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors 
 and in compliance with applicable law, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time. 
 With respect to dividend year 2024 , the Board of Directors has declared a dividend to common stockholders totaling 
 376.4 million , or 1.05 per share, consisting of the following:

Dividends to common stockholders paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 377.8 million , 
 including the amount paid in March 2024 of 0.35 per common share in respect of the fourth quarter of 2023. Dividends to 
 common stockholders paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 371.4 million , including the amount paid 
 in March 2023 of 0.325 per common share in respect of the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 Fund Commitments . Generally, Carlyle commits to fund approximately 0.75 of the capital commitments to our future 
 carry funds, although we may elect to invest additional amounts in funds focused on new investment areas. We may, from time 
 to time, exercise our right to purchase additional interests in our investment funds that become available in the ordinary course 
 of their operations. We expect our senior Carlyle professionals and employees to continue to make significant capital 
 contributions to our funds based on their existing commitments, and to make capital commitments to future funds consistent 
 with the level of their historical commitments. We also intend to make investments in our open-end funds and our CLO 

123 

Table of Contents 

vehicles. Our investments in our European CLO vehicles will comply with the risk retention rules as discussed in Risk 
 Retention Rules later in this section. 
 Since our inception through September 30, 2024 , we and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other 
 professionals have invested or committed to invest in or alongside our funds. Approximately 3 to 5 of all capital 
 commitments to our funds are funded collectively by us and our senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives and other 
 professionals. 
 A substantial majority of the remaining commitments are expected to be funded by senior Carlyle professionals, 
 operating executives, and other professionals through our internal co-investment program. Of the 4.3 billion of unfunded 
 commitments, approximately 3.6 billion is subscribed individually by senior Carlyle professionals, operating executives, and 
 other professionals, with the balance funded directly by the Company. Approximately 76 of the 4.3 billion of unfunded 
 commitments relate to investment funds in our Global Private Equity segment. 
 Under the Carlyle Global Capital Markets platform, certain of our subsidiaries may act as an underwriter, syndicator or 
 placement agent for security offerings and loan originations. We earn fees in connection with these activities and bear the risk 
 of the sale of such securities and placement of such loans, which may be longer dated. As of September 30, 2024 , there were no 
 material outstanding commitments related to the origination and syndication of loans and securities under the Carlyle Global 
 Capital Markets platform. 
 Repurchase Program . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we paid an aggregate of 345.6 million to 
 repurchase and retire approximately 8.0 million shares of common stock. In addition, during the nine months ended September 
 30, 2024 , we paid an aggregate of 133.2 million and retired 2.8 million shares of common stock to settle tax withholding 
 obligations in connection with net share settlements of equity-based awards, for a total of 478.8 million shares repurchased or 
 withheld this year. As of September 30, 2024 , 0.9 billion of repurchase capacity remained under the share repurchase program, 
 which reflects the cost of common shares repurchased as well as shares settled for tax withholding payments made by the 
 Company related to the net share settlement of equity-based awards. For further information on our repurchase program, see 
 Note 13 , Equity , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Cash Flows 
 The significant captions and amounts from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, which include the 
 effects of our Consolidated Funds and CLOs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are summarized below.

Net cash used in operating activities . Net cash used in operating activities includes the investment activity of our 
 Consolidated Funds. Excluding this activity, net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by our earnings in the 
 respective periods after adjusting for significant non-cash activity, including non-cash performance allocations and incentive 
 fees, the related non-cash performance allocations and incentive fee related compensation, non-cash equity-based 
 compensation, and depreciation, amortization and impairments, all of which are included in earnings. Operating cash inflows 
 primarily include the receipt of management fees, realized performance allocations and incentive fees, while operating cash 
 outflows primarily include payments for operating expenses, including compensation and general, administrative and other 
 expenses. 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , excluding the 
 activities of our Consolidated Funds, were 867.3 million and 718.8 million , respectively. During the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , cash inflows impacting net cash used in operating activities primarily included the receipt of 
 management fees and realized performance allocations and incentive fees, totaling approximately 2.8 billion and 2.5 billion , 

124 

Table of Contents 

respectively. These inflows were offset by payments for compensation and general, administrative and other expenses of 
 approximately 2.0 billion and 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, which 
 includes payment of 2023 and 2022 year-end bonuses paid in January 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, operating 
 outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a 68.6 million payment relating to the Carlyle Aviation 
 Partners earn-out and a 20.3 million payment to the former Carlyle Holdings unitholders related to amounts owed under the 
 tax receivable agreement. 
 Cash used to purchase investments, as well as the proceeds from the sale of such investments, are also reflected in our 
 operating activities as investments are a normal part of our operating activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 , investment proceeds were 333.3 million as compared to investment purchases of 213.8 million , which included a 
 115.1 million deferred consideration payment related to our investment in Fortitude. During the nine months ended September 
 30, 2023 , investment proceeds were 338.4 million as compared to investment purchases of 221.3 million , which included our 
 50.0 million follow-on investment in Carlyle FRL and our 40.0 million investment in Carlyle Capital Income Fun d , an NYSE 
 listed closed-end fund that primarily invests in equity and junior debt tranches of CLOs. 
 The net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also reflects the 
 investment activity of our Consolidated Funds. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , purchases of investments by the 
 Consolidated Funds were 5.0 billion , while proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds 
 were 3.7 billion . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were 
 2.3 billion , while proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were 1.7 billion . 
 Net cash used in investing activities . Our investing activities generally reflect cash used for fixed assets, software for 
 internal use, and corporate treasury investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , cash used in investing 
 activities principally reflects purchases of fixed assets of 51.0 million . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , cash 
 used in investing activities principally reflects purchases of corporate treasury investments of 187.3 million and purchases of 
 fixed assets of 49.6 million , partially offset by proceeds from corporate treasury investments of 152.4 million . 
 Net cash provided by financing activities . Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities during the nine months 
 ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , excluding the activities of our Consolidated Funds, was (888.6) million and (718.6) 
 million , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we borrowed and subsequently repaid an aggregate of 
 10.4 million under the Global Credit Revolving Credit Facility . We also paid 68.8 million in each of January 2024 and 
 January 2023, representing the final and fourth annual installments, respectively, of the deferred consideration payable to 
 former Carlyle Holdings unitholders in connection with the Conversion. 
 Dividends paid to our common stockholders were 377.8 million and 371.4 million for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we paid 478.8 million 
 and 203.7 million , respectively, to repurchase and retire 10.9 million and 6.5 million shares, respectively, which included 
 shares retired in connection with the net share settlement of equity-based awards during the nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 . 
 The net borrowings (payments) on loans payable by our Consolidated Funds during the nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 and 2023 were 1,220.5 million and 777.2 million , respectively. Contributions from non-controlling interest holders 
 were 219.2 million and 99.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, which relate 
 primarily to contributions from the non-controlling interest holders in Consolidated Funds . For the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 , distributions to non-controlling interest holders were 73.0 million and 99.7 million , 
 respectively, which relate primarily to distributions to the non-controlling interest holders in Consolidated Funds . 
 Our Balance Sheet 
 Total assets were 22.7 billion at September 30, 2024 , an increase of 1.5 billion compared to December 31, 2023 , 
 primarily attributable to an increase in Investments, including performance allocations of 1.1 billion , an increase in 
 Investments in Consolidated Funds of 0.2 billion , and an increase in Cash and cash equivalents held at Consolidated Funds of 
 0.1 billion . The increase in Investments, including performance allocations was primarily due to an increase in Accrued 
 performance allocations related to CP VII . 
 Total liabilities were 16.3 billion at September 30, 2024 , an increase of 0.9 billion from December 31, 2023 . The 
 increase in liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in Accrued compensation and benefits of 0.5 billion , an increase 
 in Deferred revenue of 0.2 billion , an increase of 0.1 billion in Other liabilities of Consolidated Funds , and an increase in 
 Deferred tax liabilities of 0.1 billion . The increase in Accrued compensation and benefits was primarily due to accruals of 

125 

Table of Contents 

performance allocations, partially offset by payments of year-end bonuses. The increase in Deferred revenue was driven by the 
 receipt of management fees not yet recognized. The increase in Deferred tax liabilities was driven by an increase in accrued 
 performance allocations, partially offset by the tax i mp act of an increase in equity-based compensation expense. 
 The assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the 
 assets of the Consolidated Funds are not available to meet our liquidity requirements and similarly the liabilities of the 
 Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us. In addition, as previously discussed, the CLO term loans generally are secured by 
 the Company s investment in the CLO, have a general unsecured interest in the Carlyle entity that manages the CLO, and do 
 not have recourse to any other Carlyle entity. 
 Our balance sheet without the effect of the Consolidated Funds can be seen in Note 17 , Supplemental Financial 
 Information , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. At 
 September 30, 2024 , our total assets without the effect of the Consolidated Funds were 15.1 billion , including cash and cash 
 equivalents of 1.4 billion and net accrued performance revenues of 2.8 billion . 
 Unconsolidated Entities 
 Certain of our funds have entered into lines of credit secured by their investors unpaid capital commitments or by a 
 pledge of the equity of the underlying investment. These lines of credit are used primarily to reduce the overall number of 
 capital calls to investors or for working capital needs. In certain instances, however, they may be used for other investment 
 related activities, including serving as bridge financing for investments. The degree of leverage employed varies among our 
 funds. 
 Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements including sponsoring and owning 
 limited or general partner interests in consolidated and non-consolidated funds, entering into derivative transactions, and 
 entering into guarantee arrangements. We also have ongoing capital commitment arrangements with certain of our consolidated 
 and non-consolidated funds. We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that would require us to fund losses or 
 guarantee target returns to investors in any of our other investment funds. 
 For further information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 2 , Summary of Significant Accounting 
 Policies , and Note 8 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this 
 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

(1) The table above assumes that no prepayments are made on the senior and subordinated notes and that the outstanding balances, if any, on the senior 
 credit facility and Global Credit Revolving Credit Facility are repaid on the maturity dates of credit facilities. The CLO term loans are included in the 
 table above based on the earlier of the stated maturity date or the date the CLO is expected to be dissolved. See Note 6 , Borrowings , to the condensed 
 consolidated financial statements for the various maturity dates of our borrowings. 
 (2) The interest rates on the debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 consist of: 3.500 on 425.0 million of senior notes, 5.650 on 350.0 million of 
 senior notes, 5.625 on 600.0 million of senior notes, 4.625 on 500.0 million of subordinated notes, and a range of approximately 5.21 to 
 11.83 for our CLO term loans. Interest payments assume that no prepayments are made and loans are held until maturity with the exception of the 
 CLO term loans, which are based on the earlier of the stated maturity date or the date the CLO is expected to be dissolved. 
 (3) These obligations represent our estimate of amounts to be paid on the contingent cash obligations associated with our acquisitions of Carlyle Aviation 
 Partners and Abingworth . The payment obligations are unsecured obligations of the Company or a subsidiary thereof, subordinated in right of payment 
 to indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, and do not bear interest. 
 (4) We lease office space in various countries around the world, including our largest offices in Washington, D.C., New York City, London, Amsterdam 
 and Hong Kong, which have non-cancelable lease agreements expiring in various years through 2036. The amounts in this table represent the minimum 
 lease payments required over the term of the lease. 
 (5) These obligations generally represent commitments by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our funds. These 
 amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. A substantial majority of these investments is 
 expected to be funded by senior Carlyle professionals and other professionals through our internal co-investment program. Of the 4.3 billion of 
 unfunded commitments to the funds, approximately 3.6 billion is subscribed individually by senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other 
 professionals, with the balance funded directly by the Company. Additionally, these obligations include accrued giveback that has been realized but not 
 yet paid to the respective funds, a portion of which is payable by current and former senior Carlyle professionals. 
 (6) In connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships 
 whereby we agreed to pay such limited partners 85 of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax realized as a 
 result of increases in tax basis resulting from exchanges of Carlyle Holdings partnership units for common units of The Carlyle Group L.P. From and 
 after the consummation of the Conversion, former holders of Carlyle Holdings partnership units do not have any rights to payments under the tax 
 receivable agreement except for payment obligations pre-existing at the time of the Conversion with respect to exchanges that occurred prior to the 
 Conversion. These obligations are more than offset by the future cash tax savings that we are expected to realize. 
 (7) These obligations represent amounts due to holders of debt securities issued by the consolidated CLO vehicles. These obligations include interest to be 
 paid on debt securities issued by the consolidated CLO vehicles. Interest payments assume that no prepayments are made and loans are held until 
 maturity. For debt securities with rights only to the residual value of the CLO and no stated interest, no interest payments were included in this 
 calculation. Interest payments on variable-rate debt securities are based on interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2024 , at spreads to market rates 
 pursuant to the debt agreements, and range from 1.15 to 12.83 . 
 (8) These obligations represent commitments of the CLOs to fund certain investments. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore 
 presented in the less than one year category. 
 Excluded from the table above are liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 43.0 million at September 30, 2024 as we are 
 unable to estimate when such amounts may be paid. 

127 

Table of Contents 

Contingent Cash Payments For Business Acquisitions and Strategic Investments 
 We have certain contingent cash obligations associated with our acquisition of Abingworth, which are accounted for as 
 compensation expense, and are accrued over the service period. If earned, payments are made in the quarter following the 
 performance year to which the payments relate. The contingent cash obligations relate to future incentive payments of up to 
 130.0 million that are payable upon the achievement of certain performance targets during 2025 through 2028, which is the 
 maximum amount that could be paid as of September 30, 2024 . Through September 30, 2024, we paid 2.5 million, and as of 
 September 30, 2024 , we recognized 2.0 million on the balance sheet related to these contingent cash obligations . 
 In connection with our acquisition of Carlyle Aviation Partners, we had contingent cash payments related to an earn-out 
 of up to 150.0 million that were payable upon the achievement of certain revenue and earnings performance targets during 
 2020 through 2025. Through December 31, 2022, we paid 53.6 million related to this earn-out. During the first quarter of 
 2023, we entered into a termination and settlement agreement with respect to the earn-out, pursuant to which we paid 
 68.6 million , and agreed to pay an aggregate 2.4 million in installments in 2024 and 2025. Pursuant to the termination and 
 settlement agreement, we paid the first installment of 1.5 million during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Risk Retention Rules 
 We will continue to comply with the risk retention rules governing CLOs issued in Europe for which we are a sponsor, 
 which require a combination of capital from our balance sheet, commitments from senior Carlyle professionals and/or third 
 party financing. 
 Guarantees 
 See Note 8 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this 
 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information related to all of our material guarantees. 
 Indemnifications 
 In many of our service contracts, we agree to indemnify the third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The 
 terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract, and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be 
 determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of 
 September 30, 2024 . See Note 8 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included 
 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information related to indemnifications. 
 Contingent Obligations (Giveback) 
 Carried interest is ultimately realized when: (1) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (2) certain costs borne 
 by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (3) the fund s cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return 
 and (4) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Realized carried 
 interest may be required to be returned by us in future periods if the fund s investment values decline below certain levels. 
 When the fair value of a fund s investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized 
 performance allocations are reversed. See Note 8 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the condensed consolidated financial 
 statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to our contingent obligations 
 (giveback). 
 Other Contingencies 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are a party to litigation, investigations, inquiries, employment-related matters, 
 disputes and other potential claims. We discuss certain of these matters in Note 8 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the 
 condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 connection with the vesting of restricted stock units subsequent to September 30, 2024 that will participate in the common 
 shareholder dividend that will be paid on November 25, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to 
 make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related 
 disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information 
 currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
 Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. 
 Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 There have been no material changes in the critical accounting estimates since those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 
 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our primary exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment advisor to our investment 
 funds and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect on management fees, 
 incentive fees and investment income, including performance allocations. Although our investment funds share many common 
 themes, each of our asset management asset classes runs its own investment and risk management processes, subject to our 
 overall risk tolerance and philosophy. The investment process of our investment funds involves a comprehensive due diligence 
 approach, including review of reputation of shareholders and management, company size and sensitivity of cash flow 
 generation, business sector and competitive risks, portfolio fit, exit risks and other key factors highlighted by the deal team. Key 
 investment decisions are generally subject to approval by both the fund-level managing directors, as well as the investment 
 committee, which is generally comprised of one or more of the three founding partners, one or more operating executives and/ 
 or senior investment professionals associated with that particular fund. Once an investment in a portfolio company has been 
 made, our fund teams closely monitor the performance of the portfolio company, generally through frequent contact with 
 management and the receipt of financial and management reports. 
 There was no material change in our market risks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . For additional 
 information, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be 
 disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 

129 

Table of Contents 

specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, 
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding 
 required disclosures. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its 
 judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any 
 disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and 
 there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any 
 controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of 
 achieving the desired control objectives. 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated 
 the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by 
 this report. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial 
 officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and 
 procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) 
 under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are 
 reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 paid by any Borrower under clause (v) above). A certificate of such Issuing Lender submitted to any 
 Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vii) shall

SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan or is informed by the Majority Lenders that the Benchmark for any requested 
 Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect 
 the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, or that deposits are not being offered to banks in the relevant 
 interbank market for the applicable amount and the Interest Period of such SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan, the 
 Administrative Agent will promptly so notify TCG (for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 2.07, 
 any provision requiring the consent of TCG or that TCG be notified shall not require any additional consent by TCG 
 SF or notification to TCG SF, as applicable) and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or 
 maintain SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the 
 Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Majority Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such 
 notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR 
 Loans or Eurocurrency Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a 
 Borrowing of ABR Loans in the amount specified therein, and the Borrowers shall not have to pay any amounts that 
 would otherwise be due under Section 3.12 with respect to such revocation or conversion (or, in the case of a 
 pending request for a Loan denominated in an Alternate Currency, TCG, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders 
 may establish a mutually acceptable alternative rate). 
 (b) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time 
 (i) (A) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent 
 manifest error) that the circumstances set forth in Section 2.07(a) have arisen and such circumstances are 
 unlikely to be temporary or (B) the circumstances set forth in Section 2.07(a) have not arisen but the 
 supervisor or the administrator of such Benchmark or a Governmental Authority or an insolvency official 
 having jurisdiction over the supervisor or administrator, or a court or an entity with similar insolvency or 
 resolution authority over the supervisor or administrator, or the central bank for the currency of the relevant 
 Benchmark has made a public statement or published information stating that the administrator or 
 supervisor (each of the foregoing, a Relevant Administrator has ceased or will cease to use such 
 Benchmark for determining interest rates for loans in Dollars, Euros or British Pounds Sterling (or any 
 other currency, as applicable) provided that, in the case of this clause (B), at the time of such statement or 
 publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such 
 Benchmark 
 (ii) a Relevant Administrator has made a public statement or published information 
 announcing that such Benchmark is no longer representative 
 (iii) an event has occurred that would require the existing Benchmark set forth in any non- 
 speculative interest rate Hedging Agreement related to the Loans to be amended by adherence to a final 
 protocol published by, or other amendment promulgated by, the International Swaps and Derivatives 
 Association, Inc. ISDA to facilitate the replacement of such Benchmark or if any non-speculative 
 interest rate Hedging Agreement related to the Loans is entered into after the Amendment No. 3 Effective 
 Date and is subject to ISDA Definitions amended after the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date that reflect a 
 replacement of such Benchmark used in this Agreement on the Amendment No. 3 Date or 
 (iv) either (A) a notification is made by TCG to the Administrative Agent or (B) a notification 
 is made by the Administrative Agent to TCG, and TCG agrees in writing that such notification constitutes a 
 Benchmark Trigger Event (as defined below), in each case, that at least five currently outstanding 
 syndicated credit facilities of the same currency as this facility, each available for review (including by way 
 of availability through posting on DebtDomain, IntraLinks, Debt X, SyndTrak Online or by similar 
 electronic means) and identified by TCG or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, in such notice, contain 
 (as a result of amendment or as originally executed) as a benchmark interest rate, in lieu of Term SOFR or 
 the Eurocurrency Rate (or similar Benchmark) a replacement benchmark rate (each of (i) through (iv), a 
 Benchmark Trigger Event ), 
 then (x) if a Benchmark Trigger Event pursuant to clause (i) of the definition thereof has occurred, the 
 Benchmark Replacement Rate will replace the Benchmark on the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date, with 

respect to this facility, for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of the Benchmark, with 
 respect to the facility, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement 
 or any other Loan Document (it being understood that, in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark 
 Replacement Rate pursuant to this clause (x) , the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark 
 Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time (to the extent expressly provided in the definition of 
 Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes , with the consent of TCG) and, notwithstanding anything to the 
 contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement 
 Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this 
 Agreement or any other Loan Document), and (y) if a Benchmark Trigger Event pursuant to clauses (ii) (iv) of the 
 definition thereof has occurred, the Administrative Agent and TCG may establish an alternate benchmark floating 
 rate of interest to Adjusted Term SOFR or the Eurocurrency Rate that is a Benchmark Replacement Rate, and may 
 enter into an amendment to this Agreement (the Benchmark Replacement Amendment to reflect such Benchmark 
 Replacement Rate and such other related changes to this Agreement with respect thereto as may be applicable in 
 their discretion, including provisions for the Administrative Agent and TCG to allow for the adoption (without 
 further amendment) of a term structure and any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes provided , further , 
 that any Benchmark Replacement Rate implemented pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall only be implemented to the 
 extent it is commercially, operationally and administratively practicable for the Administrative Agent to administer 
 (as determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, 
 the Benchmark Replacement Amendment (i) shall become effective without any further action or consent of any 
 other party to this Agreement and (ii) may designate the timing of effectiveness of the Benchmark Replacement Rate 
 (including pursuant to the occurrence of identified conditions). 
 (c) If a Benchmark Trigger Event pursuant to clauses (ii) (iv) of the definition thereof has occurred 
 and there is not a Benchmark Replacement Rate, then the Administrative Agent and TCG may establish an alternate 
 benchmark floating term rate of interest to Adjusted Term SOFR or the Eurocurrency Rate that is not a Benchmark 
 Replacement Rate, which may include a spread or method for determining a spread or other adjustments or 
 modifications (including to make appropriate adjustments for the duration and time for determination of such rate in 
 relation to any applicable Interest Period), and enter into a Benchmark Replacement Amendment to reflect such 
 alternate rate of interest, which amendment shall become effective within five Business Days of the date that notice 
 of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders unless prior to the end of such five Business Day period 
 the Administrative Agent receives a written notice from the Majority Lenders stating that such Majority Lenders 
 object to such alternate rate of interest (the Alternative Benchmark Rate provided that any Alternative 
 Benchmark Rate implemented pursuant to this paragraph shall only be implemented to the extent it is commercially, 
 operationally and administratively practicable for the Administrative Agent to administer (as determined by the 
 Administrative Agent in its sole discretion). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Alternative Benchmark Rate as so 
 determined pursuant to any clause above for the would be less than the Floor, the Alternative Benchmark Rate will 
 be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 (d) Following the effectiveness of the Benchmark Replacement Rate or the Benchmark Replacement 
 Amendment, if any Benchmark Trigger Event occurs with respect to the Benchmark Replacement Rate or the 
 Alternative Benchmark Rate identified in such Benchmark Replacement Amendment (including, for the avoidance 
 of doubt, any change in or alternative to the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment or any change in or alternative to 
 a compounded or term methodology for calculating such benchmark), then the Administrative Agent and TCG may 
 enter into an additional Benchmark Replacement Amendment to reflect another Benchmark Replacement Rate 
 without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or to reflect an Alternative Benchmark 
 Rate, which amendment, for the avoidance of doubt, shall become effective within five Business Days of the date 
 that notice of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, unless prior to the end of such five Business 
 Day period the Administrative Agent receives a written notice from the Majority Lenders stating that such Majority 
 Lenders object to such alternate rate of interest provided that, with respect to any such additional Benchmark 
 Replacement Amendment to reflect another Benchmark Replacement Rate, the Majority Lenders shall (i) not be 
 entitled to object to any such Benchmark Replacement Rate based on SOFR or SONIA contained in such additional 
 Benchmark Replacement Amendment and (ii) only be entitled to object to the Benchmark Replacement Adjustments 
 with respect thereto. 

(e) At any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement Rate), 
 (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR), then the Administrative Agent may remove 
 any tenor of such Benchmark that it reasonably determines is unavailable or non-representative for Benchmark 
 (including Benchmark Replacement Rate) settings and (ii) the Administrative Agent may reinstate any such 
 previously removed tenor for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement Rate) settings. 
 (f) The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any 
 liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to Adjusted Term SOFR, the 
 Eurocurrency Rate, or with respect to any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereof (including any 
 Benchmark Replacement Rate), or any calculation, component definition thereof or rate referenced in the definition 
 thereof, including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any 
 Benchmark Replacement) implemented pursuant to this Section 2.07, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark 
 Transition Event, and (ii) the effect, implementation or composition of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming 
 Changes pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 2.07 , including without limitation, whether the composition or 
 characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate (including any Benchmark 
 Replacement) will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, Adjusted Term SOFR or the 
 Eurocurrency Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did Adjusted Term SOFR or the Eurocurrency Rate or 
 Adjusted Term SOFR or the Eurocurrency Rate prior to the discontinuance or unavailability of Adjusted Term 
 SOFR or the Eurocurrency Rate, as applicable. In addition, the discontinuation of Adjusted Term SOFR or 
 Eurocurrency Rate, and any alternative, successor or replacement reference rate may result in a mismatch between 
 the reference rate referenced in this Agreement and your other financial instruments, including potentially those that 
 are intended as hedges. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates and or other related entities may engage in 
 transactions that affect the calculation of Adjusted Term SOFR or the Eurocurrency Rate, or any alternative, 
 successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and or any relevant adjustments thereto, in 
 each case, with all determinations of Adjusted Term SOFR or the Eurocurrency Rate or such alternative, successor 
 or replacement rate by the Administrative Agent to be conclusive, absent manifest error. The Administrative Agent 
 may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain Adjusted Term SOFR or the 
 Eurocurrency Rate, or any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition thereof, or any such 
 alternative, successor or replacement rate, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (as amended, 
 amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time), and shall have no liability to the 
 Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, 
 punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and 
 whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any 
 such information source or service.

 with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for the applicable Corresponding 
 Tenor 
 (b) the spread adjustment (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) as of the

 for the applicable Corresponding Tenor and 
 (2) for purposes of clause (i)(b) and clause (ii) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement Rate , 
 the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which 
 may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected by TCG and the Administrative 
 Agent giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or 
 method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such 
 Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant 
 Governmental Body, (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a 
 spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the 
 replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for

 appropriate adjustments for the duration and time for determination of the Benchmark 
 Replacement Rate in relation to any applicable Interest Period

 is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines that no market practice for the 

administration of the Benchmark Replacement Rate exists, in such other manner of administration as the 
 Administrative Agent, in consultation with TCG (or, for purposes of clauses (i)(c) and clause (ii) of the definition

 1,000,000, as applicable) in excess thereof and (ii) in the case of any such prepayment of a SOFR Loan or a 
 Eurocurrency Loan on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period therefor, such Borrower shall reimburse the 
 Lenders the amounts provided in Section 3.12 relating to such prepayment. 
 (b) Alternate Currency Revaluation . If at any time by reason of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
 (i) the 2025 Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds 105 of the then aggregate amount of the 2025 Tranche 
 Commitments, (ii) the 2027 Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds 105 of the then aggregate amount of the 
 2027 Tranche Commitments or (iii) the L C Exposure exceeds 105 of the Letter of Credit Facility Amount, the 
 Administrative Agent shall use all reasonable efforts to give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrowers, 
 specifying the amount to be prepaid under this clause (b), and the Borrowers (on a several and not joint basis) shall 
 prepay their respective Loans or provide cash collateral for or otherwise backstop their respective outstanding 
 Letters of Credit on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers, the Issuing Lender and the Administrative 
 Agent, in such aggregate amount as may be required to cause (A) the 2025 Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure 
 (treating such cash collateralization or other backstopping for purposes hereof as a reduction in such 2025 Tranche 
 Revolving Credit Exposure) to be equal to or less than the aggregate amount of the 2025 Tranche Commitments, (B) 
 the 2027 Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure (treating such cash collateralization or other backstopping for purposes 
 hereof as a reduction in such 2027 Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure) to be equal to or less than the aggregate 
 amount of the 2027 Tranche Commitments and (C) the L C Exposure to be equal to or less than the Letter of Credit 
 Facility Amount, such payments or other measures to be made within 10 Business Days of demand or, in the case of 
 prepayment of SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans, on the date that is the earlier of (x) the last day of the then 
 current Interest Period therefor and (y) the last Business Day of the first full calendar month after such revaluation, 
 provided that any such prepayment shall be accompanied by any amounts payable under Section 3.12. The 
 determinations of the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers in the 
 absence of manifest error. 
 SECTION 3.07 Payments Computations Etc. 
 (a) Pro rata Payments . Subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit, 
 differing payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders, the Loans comprising 
 each Borrowing shall be made pro rata among the Lenders based on their respective Applicable Commitment 
 Percentages. Except as otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence and otherwise hereunder, all 
 payments of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made for the pro rata account of the Lenders based on the 
 respective outstanding principal amounts thereof, and all payments of commitment fees and letter of credit 

commission shall be made for the pro rata account of the Lenders based on their respective Applicable Commitment 
 Percentages. 
 (b) Lenders Obligations Several . The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement are several 
 and the failure of any Lender to make any Loan or any payment required to be made by it hereunder shall not relieve 
 any other Lender of its obligations hereunder, nor shall any Lender be responsible for any other Lender s failure to 
 make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender. 
 (c) Currencies . All payments by the Borrowers of or in respect of principal of and interest on and 
 other amounts directly relating to any Loan that are denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be made in such 
 Alternate Currency. All payments of principal and interest on any Loan denominated in Dollars, all payments in 
 respect of any Letter of Credit, and all payments of fees payable pursuant to Section 2.03(c), commitment fees and 
 agency fees hereunder and all other payments by any Borrower provided for in this Agreement, except as provided 
 in the preceding sentence, shall be made in Dollars. 
 (d) Payments . 
 (i) Subject to Section 3.11, the Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under 
 each other Loan Document without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind to the Administrative 
 Agent at the Administrative Agent s Account in the Principal Financial Center for the relevant Currency 
 not later than 11 00 a.m. Local Time on the due date of such payment (each such payment made after such 
 time on such date to be deemed to have been made on the next Business Day). 
 (ii) The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds 
 relating to the payment of principal or interest ratably to the Lenders as provided in Section 3.07(a) for the 
 account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other 
 amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case 
 to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and 
 Assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(c), 
 from and after the assignment date set forth therein, the Administrative Agent shall remit all payments 
 hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, 
 and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such 
 payments for periods prior to such assignment date directly between themselves. 
 (e) Computations . All computations of interest based on the ABR (except any Federal Funds Rate 
 component thereof) and with respect to Loans denominated in British Pounds Sterling shall be made by the 
 Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, for the actual number of days 
 (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. All 
 computations of interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR or the Eurocurrency Rate (except with respect to Loans 
 denominated in British Pounds Sterling) or the Federal Funds Rate and of commitment fee shall be made by the 
 Administrative Agent, and any computations of amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.03, shall be made on the 
 basis of a year of 360 days, for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) 
 occurring in the period for which such interest or other amount is payable. Each determination by the 
 Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest 
 error. 
 (f) Payment Dates . Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes would be due on a day 
 other than a Business Day, such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and any such 
 extension of such due date shall in such case be included in the computation of interest provided that if such 
 extension would cause payment of principal or interest in respect of SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans to be made 
 in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. 
 (g) Presumption by Administrative Agent . 

(i) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the 
 proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such 
 Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made its 
 share available at such time in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and may (but shall not be obligated), in 
 reliance upon such assumption, make available to a Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a 
 Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, 
 then (A) the applicable Lender, on one hand, and (B) the Borrower of such Borrowing, on the other hand, 
 severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with 
 interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower 
 to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (x) in the case of a payment to be 
 made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative 
 Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (y) in the case of a 
 payment to be made by a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If a Borrower and such 
 Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the 
 Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such 
 Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative 
 Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any 
 payment by a Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender 
 that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 (ii) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from TCG prior to the date 
 on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the 
 Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have 
 made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may (but shall not be obligated), in reliance 
 upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not 
 in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent 
 forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and 
 including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the 
 Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative 
 Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (if such Loan is denominated 
 in Dollars) or at the overnight London interbank offered rate for the relevant Currency (if such Loan is 
 denominated in an Alternate Currency). 
 SECTION 3.08 Sharing of Payments, Etc . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or 
 counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other 
 obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its 
 Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided 
 herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and 
 (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or 
 make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the 
 Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective 
 Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that 
 (i) if any such participation is purchased and all or any portion of the related payment is 
 recovered, such participation shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such 
 recovery, without interest and 
 (ii) the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made 
 by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any 
 payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its 
 Loans other than to a Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this subsection 
 shall apply). 

The Borrowers consent to the foregoing and agree, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that 
 any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower of 
 the Loan to which such participation relates, rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as 
 fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
 SECTION 3.09 Increased Costs . 
 (a) If any Change in Law shall 
 (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, 
 insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit 
 extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.03) 
 or the Issuing Lender 
 (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Lender or the applicable offshore interbank market 
 for the applicable Alternate Currency any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this 
 Agreement or any SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or 
 participation therein or 
 (iii) subject the Lender to any Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes or Excluded Taxes) in 
 respect of its loans, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations or its deposits, reserves, or other 
 liabilities or capital attributable thereto 
 and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any 
 SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency 
 Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any 
 Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the 
 amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, 
 interest or any other amount) then, from time to time upon request of such Lender or the Issuing Lender, each 
 Borrower (on a several and not joint basis) will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender such additional amount or 
 amounts with respect to the SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans and Letters of Credit of such Borrower as will 
 compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction 
 suffered with respect to the SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans and Letters of Credit of such Borrower. 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law 
 affecting such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such 
 Lender s or the Issuing Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would 
 have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s capital or on the capital of 
 such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s holding company as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of 
 such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letter of Credit 
 issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender s or the 
 Issuing Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such 
 Lender s or the Issuing Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s holding company 
 with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time upon request of such Lender or the Issuing Lender, each 
 Borrower (on a several and not joint basis) will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such 
 additional amount or amounts with respect to the Loans made to, or Letters of Credit issued on behalf of, such 
 Borrower, as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s holding 
 company for such reduction. 
 (c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of any Lender or the Issuing Lender setting forth the 
 amount or amounts and a reasonable basis for the determination thereof necessary to compensate such Lender or the 
 Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in clauses (a) or (b) of this Section 3.09 and 
 delivered to TCG shall be conclusive on all Borrowers absent manifest error. Each Borrower (on a several and not 

joint basis) shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due from such 
 Borrower on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof. 
 (d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand 
 compensation pursuant to this Section 3.09 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s 
 right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the 
 Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 3.09 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 
 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies TCG of the Change in Law 
 giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s intention to claim 
 compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is 
 retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect 
 thereof). 
 SECTION 3.10 Illegality . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall 
 notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or 
 regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for 
 such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make or Continue SOFR 
 Loans or Eurocurrency Loans or to fund or otherwise maintain Eurocurrency Loans hereunder, (a) the obligation of 
 the Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans into, SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans, as applicable, shall 
 be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify TCG and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such 
 suspension no longer exist and (b) each SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan, as applicable, of such Lender shall 
 convert into an ABR Loan at the end of the then current Interest Period for such SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan, 
 if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans to such day, or 
 immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans. 
 SECTION 3.11 Taxes . 
 (a) All payments by or on account of any obligation of any Obligor under any Loan Document shall 
 be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law. 
 (b) In the event that any applicable Withholding Agent shall be required by applicable Laws to deduct 
 or withhold any Taxes in respect of any amounts payable under any Loan Document, (1) the applicable Withholding 
 Agent shall withhold such Taxes and timely remit such amounts to the applicable Governmental Authority and (2) to 
 the extent such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Obligor shall be increased as 
 necessary so that after all such deductions or withholdings have been made (including any such deductions and 
 withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.11), the Lender (or, in the case of a payment 
 made to the Administrative Agent for its own account, the Administrative Agent) receives an amount equal to the 
 sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 (c) The Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with 
 applicable Laws, or at the option of the Administrative Agent, timely reimburse it for, any Other Taxes. 
 (d) The Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, 
 within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified 
 Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.11) payable or paid by such 
 Administrative Agent or Lender and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or 
 not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. 
 A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Borrower by a Lender (or by the 
 Administrative Agent on its behalf or on behalf of a Lender) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (e) TCG shall furnish to the Administrative Agent original or certified copies of official tax receipts in 
 respect of each payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Obligor required under this Section 3.11, as soon as 
 practicable after the date such payment is made, and the Borrowers shall promptly furnish to the Administrative 
 Agent at its request or, at the request of any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) to such Lender any other 

information, documents and receipts that the Administrative Agent or such Lender may reasonably request to 
 establish that full and timely payment has been made of all Indemnified Taxes required to be paid under this Section 
 3.11. 
 (f) (i) Each Lender that is not a U.S. Person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a Non-

 in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 
 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of portfolio interest, a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit E 
 and a Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto,

 rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on any applicable payments by the Borrowers under this Agreement and the 
 other Loan Documents. Such documentation shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it 
 becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of TCG or the 
 Administrative Agent). 
 (ii) Each Lender that is a U.S. Person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall 
 deliver to TCG and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a 
 Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of TCG or the 
 Administrative Agent), two executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt 
 from U.S. federal backup withholding tax. 
 (iii) Each Lender shall deliver to TCG and the Administrative Agent at the time or times 
 prescribed by applicable law and at such time or times reasonably requested by TCG or the Administrative 
 Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Laws and such additional documentation reasonably 
 requested by TCG or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for either Borrower or the 
 Administrative Agent to comply with any obligations of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent under 
 FATCA or to determine whether a Lender has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine 
 the amount, if any, to withhold from any payment to such Lender. Solely for purposes of this clause (iii), 
 FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 (iv) Each Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to TCG 
 and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about 
 the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time 
 thereafter upon the reasonable request of TCG or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other 
 form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal 
 withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed 
 by applicable Law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or 
 deduction required to be made. 
 (v) Upon the obsolescence, expiration or invalidity (in whole or in part) of any 
 documentation previously delivered by a Lender under this Section 3.11(f), such Lender shall promptly 
 provide TCG and the Administrative Agent with updated or other appropriate documentation or promptly 
 notify TCG and the Administrative Agent in writing of such Lender s legal ineligibility to do so. 
 (vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.11(f), no Lender shall be required 
 to deliver any documentation pursuant to this Section 3.11(f) that such Lender is not legally eligible to 
 provide. 
 (g) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Obligors and to any 
 successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant 
 to this Section 3.11(f) . 

(h) On or prior to the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement, (A) the Administrative 
 Agent, and any successor or supplemental Administrative Agent, that is a U.S. Person shall provide to TCG two 
 duly completed original signed copies of IRS Form W-9 and (B) the Administrative Agent, and any successor or 
 supplemental Administrative Agent, that is not a U.S. Person shall deliver to TCG two duly completed original

 account and two duly completed original signed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY assuming primary responsibility for 
 withholding under Chapters 3 and 4 of the Code with respect to payments to be received under the Loan Documents 
 for the account of Lenders. Whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstance renders any such documentation 
 expired, obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, the applicable Administrative Agent shall deliver promptly to TCG 
 updated or other appropriate documentation or promptly notify TCG of its legal ineligibility to do so. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.11(g), no Administrative Agent shall be required to 
 deliver any documentation that such Administrative Agent is not legally eligible to deliver as a result of a Change in 
 Law after the date hereof. 
 (i) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a 
 refund of any Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers or with respect to which a 
 Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.11, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal 
 to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower 
 under this Section 3.11 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out- 
 of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, and without 
 interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided 
 that each Borrower, upon the request of such Administrative Agent or any Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid 
 over to such Borrower to such Administrative Agent or Lender in the event such Administrative Agent or any 
 Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to 
 require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns or its books or records (or any other 
 information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person. 
 (j) For purposes of this Section 3.11, the term Lender shall include any Issuing Lender. 
 SECTION 3.12 Break Funding Payments . Each Borrower (on a several and not joint basis) agrees to 
 indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender 
 which is in the nature of funding breakage costs or costs of liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds 
 and any other related expense (but excluding loss of margin or other loss of anticipated profit), which such Lender 
 may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by such Borrower in making any Borrowing of SOFR Loans or 
 Eurocurrency Loans after such Borrower has given a Notice of Borrowing requesting the same in accordance with 
 the provisions of this Agreement (including as a result of any failure to fulfill, on or before the date specified in such 
 Notice of Borrowing, the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV), (b) default by such Borrower in making any 
 prepayment of any SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan when due after such Borrower has given notice thereof in 
 accordance with this Agreement, (c) the making by such Borrower of a prepayment of any SOFR Loan or 
 Eurocurrency Loan on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto, (d) default by such 
 Borrower in payment when due of the principal of or interest on any SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan, (e) the 
 Conversion or Continuation of any SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan of such Borrower on a day other than on the 
 last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto, and (f) any assignment such Lender is required to make pursuant 
 to Section 3.13(b) if such Lender holds SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans of such Borrower at the time of such 
 assignment. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts and a reasonable basis for the 
 determination thereof that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 3.12 and delivered to TCG shall 
 be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Borrower (on a several and not joint basis) shall pay to such Lender the 
 amount due from such Borrower shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
 SECTION 3.13 Mitigation Obligations Replacement of Lenders . 
 (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 
 3.09, or requires any Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the 
 account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.11, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a 

different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder 
 to another of its offices, if, in the sole and absolute judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) 
 would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.09 or 3.11, as the case may be, in the future and 
 (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous 
 to such Lender. 
 (b) Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.09, or if any 
 Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of 
 any Lender pursuant to Section 3.11, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender has failed to 
 consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination (such Lender, a Non-Consenting Lender that, 
 pursuant to the terms of Section 9.01, requires the consent of all of the Lenders or all of the Lenders affected (and 
 such Lender is an affected Lender) and with respect to which the Majority Lenders shall have granted their consent, 
 then such Borrower may, at such Borrower s sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the 
 Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject 
 to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations 
 under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations 
 (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that 
 (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on and as of the date of 
 such notice and the date of such assignment 
 (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal 
 of its Loans and accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and 
 under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Sections 3.09, 3.11 or 3.12) from the 
 assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the 
 case of all other amounts) 
 (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 
 3.09 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.11, such assignment will result in a reduction 
 in such compensation or payments thereafter 
 (iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws and 
 (v) in the case of a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall 
 have agreed to, and shall be sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders) to cause the applicable 
 change, waiver, discharge or termination (it being understood that the execution and delivery of an 
 Assignment and Assumption to reflect an assignment of a Non-Consenting Lender shall not be necessary). 
 A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by 
 such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling a Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to 
 apply. A Lender so replaced shall not be required to pay the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 
 9.06(b). In connection with any such replacement, if any such replaceable Lender does not execute and deliver to the 
 Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and Assumption reflecting such replacement within two Business 
 Days of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption to such 
 replaceable Lender, then such replaceable Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment

 Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the 
 Administrative Agent fifth , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and TCG, to be held in a deposit 
 account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential future funding

 future L C Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued 
 under this Agreement sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders as

 jurisdiction provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L C 
 Payments in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) 
 such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in 
 Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L C 
 Payments owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of 
 any Loans of, or L C Payments owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded 
 and unfunded participations in L C Reimbursement Obligations are held by the Lenders pro rata in 
 accordance with their Applicable Commitment Percentages without giving effect to Section 3.14(a)(iv). 
 Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or 
 held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 
 3.14(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably 
 consents hereto. 
 (iii) Certain Fees . Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive the facility fee pursuant 
 to Section 2.03(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable 
 to the sum of (1) the outstanding principal amount of the Loans funded by it, and (2) its Total Commitment 
 Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided cash collateral. Each 
 Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive letter of credit fees pursuant to Section 2.03(c) for any period 
 during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Total Commitment 
 Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided cash collateral pursuant to the 
 terms hereof. With respect to any facility fee or letter of credit fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting 
 Lender pursuant to this Section 3.14(a)(iii), each Borrower (on a several and not joint basis) shall (x) pay to 
 each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with 
 respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letters of Credit issued on behalf of such Borrower that 
 has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the Issuing 
 Lender the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to 
 the Issuing Lender s L C Exposure in respect of Letters of Credit issued on behalf of such Borrower to such 
 Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 

(iv) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce L C Exposure . All or any part of such 
 Defaulting Lender s participation in Letters of Credit shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting 
 Lenders in accordance with their respective Total Commitment Percentages (calculated without regard to 
 such Defaulting Lender s Commitments) but only to the extent that (x), if requested by the applicable 
 Issuing Lender, the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, 
 unless the Borrowers shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrowers 
 shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) 
 such reallocation does not cause (A) the aggregate of the 2025 Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure 
 allocable to any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s 2025 Tranche 
 Commitment or (B) the aggregate of the 2027 Tranche Revolving Credit Exposure allocable to any Non- 
 Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s 2027 Tranche Commitment. No reallocation 
 hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting 
 Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non- 
 Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such 
 reallocation. 
 (v) Cash Collateral . If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only 
 partially, be effected, each Borrower (on a several and not joint basis) shall, without prejudice to any right 
 or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, promptly cash collateralize the Issuing Lenders L C 
 Exposure in respect of Letters of Credit issued on behalf of such Borrower. 
 (b) Defaulting Lender Cure . If TCG, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender agree in 
 writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the 
 Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice 
 and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), 
 such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take 
 such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and 
 unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their 
 Applicable Commitment Percentages (without giving effect to Section 3.14(a)(iv)), whereupon that Lender will 
 cease to be a Defaulting Lender provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees 
 accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender and 
 provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder 
 from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising 
 from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
 (c) New Letters of Credit . So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Lender shall not 
 be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is reasonably satisfied that it will have 
 no L C Exposure after giving effect thereto.

 obligations under the Guarantee and Security Agreement, or (ii) of any Subsidiary to make Restricted Payments to 
 any Borrower or any Guarantor or to otherwise transfer property to or invest in any Borrower or any Guarantor, 
 other than (A) this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (B) any agreements governing Finance Subsidiary 
 Debt and, in the case of clause (i) above only, purchase money Liens (or any permitted refinancing in respect 
 thereof) or Capital Lease Obligations otherwise permitted hereby (in which case, any prohibition or limitation shall 
 only be effective against the assets financed thereby and in the case of any permitted refinancing of purchase money 
 Indebtedness, no more restrictive than that in the relevant refinanced agreement), (C) any such agreement in effect at 
 the time any Subsidiary becomes a Subsidiary of a Borrower, so long as such agreement was not entered into solely 
 in contemplation of such Person becoming a Subsidiary of such Borrower, (D) any such agreement imposed or 
 required by or otherwise entered into with any applicable Governmental Authority, (E) any agreement in respect of 
 Indebtedness outstanding under Section 6.02(a)(vii) and (F) any agreement in respect of Indebtedness permitted to

 receipt of any dividend permitted pursuant to Section 6.02(e), and (b) upon terms that, in the aggregate, are no less

 6.03 for any later test period that includes such fiscal period) as of the relevant date of determination in an amount 
 equal to such net cash proceeds. 
 (b) Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of an irrevocable notice from the Borrowers delivered 
 concurrent with the delivery of financial statements pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or (b), as applicable, and through the

 exercised on or prior to the Cure Date, such Default or Event of Default shall spring into existence after such time 
 and the Administrative Agent and any Lender may take any actions or remedies pursuant to the terms of this 
 Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 (c) If, after the exercise of the Cure Right and the recalculations pursuant to clause (a) above, the 
 Borrowers shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the covenant set forth in Section 6.03 for the 
 relevant fiscal quarter, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of such covenant as of the 
 relevant date of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such 
 date. 
 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in each four consecutive fiscal quarter period 
 there shall be at least two fiscal quarters in which the Cure Right is not exercised, (ii) during the term of this

 such bank with an office in New York, New York. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the

 gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a 
 successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above (including TCG s consent and that such 
 successor not be a Disqualified Institution), provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and 
 the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless 
 become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from 
 its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral

 to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative 
 Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations under the 
 Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this subsection). The fees payable by 
 the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless 
 otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation, 
 the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring 
 Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to 
 be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. At any time

 Agent may be removed as the Administrative Agent hereunder at the request of the Borrowers. 
 SECTION 8.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders . Each Lender acknowledges 
 that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their 
 Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit 
 analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and 
 without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on 
 such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions 
 in taking or not taking action under or based upon any Loan Document or any related agreement or any document 
 furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
 SECTION 8.08 Administrative Agent Indemnification . To the extent required by any applicable Laws, 
 the Administrative Agent may withhold in respect of any payment to any Lender the amount of any applicable 
 withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the obligation of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries under 
 Section 3.11, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make 
 payable in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, all Taxes and all related losses, claims, liabilities 
 and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by 
 or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority 
 as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax in respect of any amounts paid to or 
 for the account of such Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate documentation was not delivered 
 or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in 
 circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), whether or not such 
 Taxes are correctly or legally asserted. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any 
 Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the 
 Administrative Agent to set off and apply all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or 
 any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 8.08. The 
 agreements in this Section 8.08 shall survive the resignation and or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any 
 assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the commitments and the repayment, 
 satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 

SECTION 8.09 No Other Duties Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Lead 
 Arranger and any bookrunner listed on the cover page hereof shall not, in such capacities, have any powers, duties or 
 responsibilities under any of the Loan Documents.

 Agent at its e-mail address set forth above shall constitute effective delivery of the communications to the 
 Administrative Agent for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the 
 next sentence) specifying that the communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective 
 delivery of the communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees (i) to 
 provide to the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication), promptly after the date of 
 this Agreement, one or more e-mail addresses to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission

 (a) No failure on the part of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in 
 exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a 
 waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any 
 other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, 
 powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and 
 privileges provided by law. 
 (b) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at 
 any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all 
 deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other 
 obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any 
 Borrower against any and all of the obligations of such now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other 
 Loan Document to such Lender irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this 
 Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of such Borrower may be contingent or 
 unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit 
 or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender under this Section 9.03 are in addition to other rights 
 and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender may have. Each Lender agrees to notify TCG and

 Borrower or any other Obligor and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such 
 indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or 
 related expenses (x) are determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to 
 have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a 
 claim brought by any Borrower against an Indemnitee for material breach of such Indemnitee s obligations 
 hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if such Borrower has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in 
 its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04 shall 
 not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any

 out of, in connection with, or as a result of, any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated 
 hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof or any Letter of 
 Credit or the use of proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any

 thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct

 Lender s Commitment and the Loans of any Class at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to 
 a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender (in each case, other than 
 a Disqualified Institution), the aggregate amount of the Commitments (which for this purpose includes 
 Loans outstanding thereunder) of any Class or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the 
 principal outstanding balance of the Loans of such Class of the assigning Lender subject to each such

 delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, 
 as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than 5,000,000 or an integral multiple of 1,000,000 (or, if the

 Administrative Agent as to whether a specific potential assignee or prospective participant is a Disqualified 
 Institution, the Administrative Agent shall be permitted to disclose to such inquiring Lender whether such 
 specific potential assignee or prospective participant is on the list of Disqualified Institutions provided that 
 the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, 
 inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Institutions 
 and shall not be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or Participant or 
 prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified Institution or have any liability with respect to or arising

 Assignment Date ), the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the 
 interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this 
 Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and 
 Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and 
 Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall 
 cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.09, 3.11, 3.12 and 9.04 with 
 respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to such Assignment Date. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender 
 of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes 
 of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with 
 clause (d) of this Section 9.06.

 the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender 
 hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available 
 for inspection by the Borrowers and, solely with respect to itself, any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time 
 to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
 (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or 
 the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or any Borrower or any of 
 TCG s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any Disqualified Institutions) (each, a Participant in all or a portion of such 
 Lender s rights and or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and or the 
 Loans owing to it) provided that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) 
 such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and 
 (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such 
 Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
 Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such 
 Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver 
 of any provision of this Agreement provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will 
 not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first 
 proviso of Section 9.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to clause (e) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that 
 each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits and obligations of Sections 3.09, 3.11, and 3.12 (subject to the 
 requirements and limitations of such sections and it being understood that the documentation required under Section 
 3.11(f) shall be delivered solely to the participating Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had 
 acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 9.06. Each Lender that sells a participation 
 shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and 
 address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and interest amounts) of each Participant s interest in the 
 Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register provided that no Lender shall 
 have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of 
 any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit 
 or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish 
 that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of 
 the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest 

error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of 
 such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 
 (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights . A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater 
 payment under Sections 3.09, 3.11 and 3.12 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with 
 respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such greater entitlement results from a 
 Change in Law after the participation occurs. 
 (f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender, without the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent 
 may at any time grant security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement or any Note to secure 
 obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank 
 provided, that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. 
 (g) Resignation as Issuing Lender after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
 contained herein, (i) if at any time MHCB assigns all of its Commitments and Loans pursuant to Section 9.06(b), 
 MHCB may, upon 30 days notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Lender and (ii) if at any time 
 MHCB resigns as Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.06, it shall be deemed to automatically resign as 
 Issuing Lender. In the event of any such resignation as Issuing Lender, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint, 
 from among the Lenders, a successor Issuing Lender hereunder provided, however, that no failure by the Borrowers 
 to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of MHCB as Issuing Lender. If MHCB resigns as Issuing 
 Lender, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to all 
 Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Issuing Lender and all L C Exposure with 
 respect thereto. Upon the appointment of a successor Issuing Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and 
 become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Lender, and (b) the 
 successor Issuing Lender shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at 
 the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to MHCB to effectively assume the obligations 
 of MHCB with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
 (h) Disqualified Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any Loans are 
 assigned or any participations are purchased or otherwise acquired, without TCG s consent (in violation of Section 
 9.06(b) or (d)), to any Disqualified Institution, then (i) the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon 
 notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent, (x) terminate any commitment of such 
 Disqualified Institution and repay any applicable outstanding Loans, plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other 
 amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder, but, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, 
 without premium, penalty, prepayment fee, breakage or accrued interest, and or (y) require such Disqualified 
 Institution to assign its rights and obligations to one or more Eligible Assignees at the price paid by it, plus accrued 
 fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder, but, notwithstanding anything to 
 the contrary, without premium, penalty, prepayment fee, accrued interest or breakage (which assignment shall not be 
 subject to the processing and recordation fee described in Section 9.06(b)(iii)), (ii) no such Disqualified Institution 
 shall (x) receive any information or reporting provided by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any other 
 Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent or (z) access any 
 electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of 
 the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, (iii) for purposes of voting, any Loans, Commitments or participations 
 held by such Disqualified Institution shall be deemed not to be outstanding and such Disqualified Institution shall 
 have no voting or consent rights with respect to Majority Lender or consents, in each case notwithstanding Section 
 9.01, (iv) for purposes of any matter requiring the vote or consent of each Lender affected by any amendment or 
 waiver, such Disqualified Institution shall be deemed to have voted or consented to approve such amendment or 
 waiver if a majority of the affected Lenders so approves and (v) such Disqualified Institution shall not be entitled to 
 any expense reimbursement or indemnification rights ordinarily afforded to Lenders or Participants hereunder or in 
 any Loan Document and such Disqualified Institution shall be treated in all other respects as a Defaulting Lender.

 SECTION 9.15 USA PATRIOT Act . Each Lender hereby notifies each Borrower and each Guarantor 
 that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 
 26, 2001)) (the Patriot Act ), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies such Borrower 
 and such Guarantor, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that 
 will allow such Lender to identify such Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. 
 SECTION 9.16 Judgment Currency . This is an international loan transaction in which the specification 
 of Dollars or an Alternate Currency, as the case may be (the Specified Currency ), and any payment in New York 
 City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the Specified Place ), is of the essence, and the 
 Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to amounts denominated in such Specified 
 Currency. The payment obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not 
 be discharged by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or 
 otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified 
 Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place 
 due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder 
 in the Specified Currency into another currency (the Second Currency ), the rate of exchange which shall be 
 applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could 
 purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding that on which such 
 judgment is rendered. The obligation of the Borrowers in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative 
 Agent or any Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such 
 judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent 
 or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder or under the Notes in the Second 
 Currency to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking 
 procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second 
 Currency so adjudged to be due and each Borrower (on a several and not joint basis) hereby, as a separate 

obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as 
 the case may be, against, and to pay the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on demand in the 
 Specified Currency, any difference between the sum originally due from such Borrower to the Administrative Agent 
 or such Lender, as the case may be, in the Specified Currency and the amount of the Specified Currency so 
 purchased and transferred. 
 SECTION 9.17 European Monetary Union .

 Unit or in that National Currency Unit, any party to this Agreement shall be entitled to pay such amount either in the 
 Euro Unit or in such National Currency Unit. 
 (c) Payments by the Administrative Agent Generally. With respect to the payment of any amount 
 denominated in the Euro or in a National Currency Unit, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any 
 Borrower or any of the Lenders in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the consequences of any delay, in the 
 crediting to any account of any amount required by this Agreement to be paid by the Administrative Agent if the 
 Administrative Agent shall have taken all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this Agreement, the

 the Lenders and the Lenders to the Borrowers under or pursuant to this Agreement, except as expressly provided in 
 this Section 9.17, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as

 Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the U.S.

 same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and 
 such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the 
 United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party 
 becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan 
 Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised 
 against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be 
 exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed 
 by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood 
 and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the
