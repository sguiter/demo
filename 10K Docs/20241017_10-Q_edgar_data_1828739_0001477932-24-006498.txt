These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and calculations of liabilities that might be necessary should be Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 7 | Page Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation Use of Estimates Income Taxes New Accounting Pronouncements Fair Value of Financial Instruments 8 | Page Table of Contents shares of common stock authorized with a par value of per share.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Effective January 22, 2024, Hanna Selyska, the previous sole officer and director and majority shareholder the Company, entered into stock purchase agreements for the sale of an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company, representing approximately 73.93 of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company as of such date, to five (5) purchasers. Also effective January 22, 2024, Hanna Selyska appointed Jian-Meng(James) Yang Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. 10 | Page Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATION As of June 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 19,632. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. Revenue During the three month and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not generate any revenue. Operating Expenses During the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024, we incurred total expenses and professional fees of 17,799 compared to 21,490 for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2023. General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting. Net Loss Our net loss for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 was 4,784 compared to 3,082 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2023. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As at June 30, 2024 our total assets were 4,928 compared to 2,499 in total assets at September 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2024 our current liabilities were 9,712 compared to 45,859 in current liabilities as at September 30, 2023. Stockholders deficit was 4,784 as of June 30, 2024 compared to 43,360 as of September 30, 2023. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities was 12,986, consisting of net loss of 19,632, amortization expenses of 101, 1833 on disposal of fixed assets and 4,712 of accounts payable. Compared to the nine-month period ended June 30, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was 31,490, consisting of net loss of 21,490 and 10,000 of accrued liabilities. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities during the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024 was 17,350 consisting of loan from shareholder with 4,364 of increase in cash and cash equivalents, compared to 26,300 for the nine-month period ended June 30 2023. 11 | Page Table of Contents PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. GOING CONCERN The independent auditors report accompanying our September 30, 2023 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e)) within the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that as a result of material weaknesses related to lack of segregation of duties and multiple levels of review over the financial reporting process, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the last quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 12 | Page Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties. Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS No equity securities were sold during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024. Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES No senior securities were issued and outstanding during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024. Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable to our Company.
