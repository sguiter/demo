Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This report contains statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. These statements are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements can typically be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as "will," "may," "could," "project," "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "continue," "intend," "potential," "plan," "forecast" and similar terms. These statements are based upon the relevant Registrant's current intentions, estimates, assumptions, expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors. Many of these factors are outside the control of each Registrant and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others: 
 general economic, political and business conditions, as well as changes in, and compliance with, laws and regulations, including income tax reform, initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the utility industry and reliability and safety standards, affecting the respective Registrant's operations or related industries; 
 changes in, and compliance with, environmental laws, regulations, decisions and policies, whether directed towards protection of environmental resources, present and future climate considerations or social justice concerns that could, among other items, increase operating and capital costs, reduce facility output, accelerate facility retirements or delay facility construction or acquisition; 
 the outcome of regulatory rate reviews and other proceedings conducted by regulatory agencies or other governmental and legal bodies and the respective Registrant's ability to recover costs through rates in a timely manner; 
 changes in economic, industry, competition or weather conditions, as well as demographic trends, new technologies and various conservation, energy efficiency and private generation measures and programs, that could affect customer growth and usage, electricity and natural gas supply or the respective Registrant's ability to obtain long-term contracts with customers and suppliers; 
 performance, availability and ongoing operation of the respective Registrant's facilities, including facilities not operated by the Registrants, due to the impacts of market conditions, outages and associated repairs, transmission constraints, weather, including wind, solar and hydroelectric conditions, and operating conditions; 
 the effects of catastrophic and other unforeseen events, which may be caused by factors beyond the control of each respective Registrant or by a breakdown or failure of the Registrants' operating assets, including severe storms, floods, fires, extreme temperature events, wind events, earthquakes, explosions, landslides, an electromagnetic pulse, mining incidents, costly litigation, wars, terrorism, pandemics, embargoes, and cyber security attacks, data security breaches, disruptions, or other malicious acts; 
 the risks and uncertainties associated with wildfires that have occurred, are occurring or may occur in the respective Registrant's service territory; the damage caused by such wildfires; the extent of the respective Registrant's liability in connection with such wildfires (including the risk that the respective Registrant may be found liable for damages regardless of fault); investigations into such wildfires; the outcomes of any legal proceedings, demands or similar actions initiated against the respective Registrant; the risk that the respective Registrant is not able to recover losses from insurance or through rates; and the effect of such wildfires, investigations and legal proceedings on the respective Registrant's financial condition and reputation; 
 the outcomes of legal or other actions and the effects of amounts to be paid to complainants as a result of settlements or final legal determinations associated with the Wildfires, which could have a material adverse effect on PacifiCorp's financial condition and could limit PacifiCorp's ability to access capital on terms commensurate with historical transactions or at all and could impact PacifiCorp's liquidity, cash flows and capital expenditure plans; 
 the respective Registrant's ability to reduce wildfire threats and improve safety, including the ability to comply with the targets and metrics set forth in its wildfire mitigation plans; to retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation plans; the effectiveness of its system hardening; ability to achieve vegetation management targets; and the cost of these programs and the timing and outcome of any proceeding to recover such costs through rates; 
 the ability to economically obtain insurance coverage, or any insurance coverage at all, sufficient to cover losses arising from catastrophic events, such as wildfires; 
 a high degree of variance between actual and forecasted load or generation that could impact a Registrant's hedging strategy and the cost of balancing its generation resources with its retail load obligations; 
 changes in prices, availability and demand for wholesale electricity, coal, natural gas, other fuel sources and fuel transportation that could have a significant impact on generating capacity and energy costs; 
 iv 

the financial condition, creditworthiness and operational stability of the respective Registrant's significant customers and suppliers; 
 changes in business strategy or development plans;

 Further details of the potential risks and uncertainties affecting the Registrants are described in the Registrants' filings with the SEC, including Part II, Item 1A and other discussions contained in this Form 10-Q.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
 Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, and changes in equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 23, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, describes the most significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. There have been no significant changes in the Company's accounting policies or its assumptions regarding significant accounting estimates during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, other than the updates associated with the Company's estimates of loss contingencies related to the Oregon and Northern California 2020 wildfires (the "2020 Wildfires"). Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the 2020 Wildfires and the wildfire that began in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California in July 2022 (the "2022 McKinney Fire"), collectively referred to as the "Wildfires."

 limited partner interests in Cove Point LNG, LP ("Cove Point") ("the Transaction"). Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 9, 2023, the Buyer paid billion in cash, plus the pro rata portion of the quarterly distribution made by Cove Point for the third fiscal quarter of 2023. BHE funded the Transaction with cash on hand, including cash realized from the liquidation of certain investments, which was contributed to BHE GT S. The Buyer now owns an aggregate of of the limited partner interests, and its affiliate, Cove Point GP Holding Company, LLC, continues to own of the general partner interest, of Cove Point. Prior to the Transaction, BHE owned of the general partner interest and of the limited partner interests in Cove Point. BHE previously determined it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Cove Point's economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and benefits which could be significant to it and accordingly, consolidated Cove Point. Because BHE controls Cove Point both before and after the Transaction, the changes in BHE's ownership interest in Cove Point were accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized. In connection with the Transaction, BHE recognized million of income taxes in equity primarily attributable to the step up in tax basis of the investment in Cove Point of million, partially offset by establishing additional regulatory liabilities related to excess deferred income taxes of million.

 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which the Company transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, the Company uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent the Company's estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. The Company bases its forward price curves upon market price quotations, when available, or internally developed and commercial models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations are obtained from independent brokers, exchanges, direct communication with market participants and actual transactions executed by the Company. Market price quotations are generally readily obtainable for the applicable term of the Company's outstanding derivative contracts; therefore, the Company's forward price curves reflect observable market quotes. Market price quotations for certain electricity and natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable due to the length of the contract. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, as well as for those contracts that are not actively traded, the Company uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of these derivative contracts is a function of the underlying forward commodity prices, interest rates, currency rates, related volatility, counterparty creditworthiness and duration of contracts. 
 
 The Company's mortgage loans held for sale are valued based on independent quoted market prices, where available, or the prices of other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. As necessary, these prices are adjusted for typical securitization activities, including servicing value, portfolio composition, market conditions and liquidity. 
 
 The Company's investments in money market mutual funds and debt and equity securities are stated at fair value. When available, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used to record the fair value. In the absence of a quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security, the fair value is determined using pricing models or net asset values based on observable market inputs and quoted market prices of securities with similar characteristics.

 The Company's long-term debt is carried at cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is a Level 2 fair value measurement and has been estimated based upon quoted market prices, where available, or at the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates consistent with comparable maturities with similar credit risks. The carrying value of the Company's variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair value because of the frequent repricing of these instruments at market rates.

 billion through 2031. 
 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, MidAmerican Energy entered into firm construction commitments totaling million for the remainder of 2024 through 2026 related to the construction and repowering of wind-powered generating facilities in Iowa. 
 21 

billion through 2028 for the Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program that will be developed in western and northern Nevada. 
 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Sierra Pacific entered into engineering, procurement and construction agreements along with equipment and materials agreements totaling million for a 400-MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 400-MW of co-located battery storage that will be developed in Churchill County, Nevada. 
 
 Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal, hazardous and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact the Company's current and future operations. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 Lower Klamath Hydroelectric Project 
 
 In November 2022, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") issued a license surrender order for the Lower Klamath Project, which was accepted by the Klamath River Renewal Corporation ("KRRC") and the states of Oregon and California ("States") in December 2022, along with the transfer of the Lower Klamath Project dams. Although PacifiCorp no longer owned the Lower Klamath Project, PacifiCorp continued to operate the facilities under an operation and maintenance agreement with the KRRC until each facility was ready for removal. PacifiCorp's obligations under the operations and maintenance agreement terminated in January 2024. Removal of the Copco No. 2 facility was completed in November 2023, and removal of the remaining dams (J.C. Boyle, Copco No. 1 and Iron Gate) was completed in October 2024. The KRRC has million in funding available for dam removal and restoration; million collected from PacifiCorp's Oregon and California customers and million in California bond funds. PacifiCorp and the States have also agreed to equally share cost overruns that may occur above the initial million in funding. Specifically, PacifiCorp and the States have agreed to equally fund an initial million supplemental fund and equally share any additional costs above that amount to ensure dam removal and restoration is complete. In May 2024, the KRRC communicated to PacifiCorp and the States that it expects to require the million of supplemental funds. 
 
 Legal Matters 
 
 The Company is party to a variety of legal actions, including litigation, arising out of the normal course of business, some of which assert claims for damages in substantial amounts and are described below. For certain legal actions, parties at times may seek to impose fines, penalties and other costs. 
 
 Pursuant to ASC 450, " Contingencies ," a provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable a liability is likely to occur and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates the related range of reasonably estimated losses and records a loss based on its best estimate within that range or the lower end of the range if there is no better estimate. 
 
 Wildfires 
 
 As of the date of this filing, a significant number of complaints and demands alleging similar claims related to the Wildfires have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon associated with 2020 Wildfires for which certain jury verdicts were issued as described below. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, noneconomic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, punitive damages, other damages and attorneys' fees. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned complaints. Additionally, the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice have informed PacifiCorp that they are contemplating filing actions against PacifiCorp in connection with certain of the Oregon 2020 Wildfires. PacifiCorp is actively cooperating with the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice on resolving these alleged claims through alternative dispute resolution. 
 
 22 

billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints and the mass complaints described below that seek billion. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are excluded from this amount. For class actions, amounts specified by the plaintiffs in the complaints include amounts based on estimates of the potential class size, which ultimately may be significantly greater than estimated. Additionally, damages are not limited to the amounts specified in the initially filed complaints as plaintiffs are frequently allowed to amend their complaints to add additional damages and amounts awarded in a court proceeding may be significantly greater than the damages specified. Oregon law provides for doubling of economic and property damages in the event the defendant is found to have acted with gross negligence, recklessness, willfulness or malice. Oregon law provides for trebling of the damages associated with timber, shrubs and produce in the event the defendant is determined to have willfully and intentionally trespassed. 
 
 In California, under inverse condemnation, courts have held that investor-owned utilities can be liable for real and personal property damages from wildfires without the utility being found negligent and regardless of fault. California law also permits inverse condemnation plaintiffs to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs. In both Oregon and California, PacifiCorp has equipment in areas accessed through special use permits, easements or similar agreements that may contain provisions requiring it to pay for damages caused by its equipment regardless of fault. Even if inverse condemnation or other provisions do not apply, PacifiCorp could be found liable for all damages. 
 
 Based on available information to date, PacifiCorp believes it is probable that losses will be incurred associated with the Wildfires. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation or similar processes, the outcome of which, if adverse, could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on PacifiCorp's financial condition. 
 
 2020 Wildfires 
 
 In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to several major wildfires, which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries and loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. The wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp's service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over acres in aggregate. Third-party reports for these wildfires indicate over structures destroyed, including residences; several structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. 
 
 Investigations into the cause and origin of each wildfire are complex and ongoing and have been or are being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. 
 
 The James Case 
 
 On September 30, 2020, a class action complaint against PacifiCorp was filed, captioned Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp, (" James ") in Oregon Circuit Court in Multnomah County, Oregon ("Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon"). The complaint was filed by Oregon residents and businesses who seek to represent a class of all Oregon citizens and entities whose real or personal property was harmed beginning on September 7, 2020, by wildfires in Oregon allegedly caused by PacifiCorp. In November 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to limit the class to include Oregon citizens allegedly impacted by the Santiam Canyon, Echo Mountain Complex, South Obenchain and 242 wildfires. In May 2022, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon granted issue class certification and consolidated the James case with several other cases. While PacifiCorp's pre-trial request for immediate appeal of the class certification was denied, it subsequently filed to appeal the class issues as described below. 
 
 In April 2023, the jury trial for James with respect to named plaintiffs began in Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon. In June 2023, the jury issued its verdict finding PacifiCorp liable to the named plaintiffs and to the class with respect to the wildfires. The jury found PacifiCorp's conduct grossly negligent, reckless and willful as to each plaintiff and the entire class. The jury awarded the named plaintiffs million of damages, including million of economic damages, million of noneconomic damages and million of punitive damages based on a multiplier of the economic and noneconomic damages. 
 
 In September 2023, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon ordered trial dates for damages phase trials described below wherein plaintiffs in each of the damages phase trials would present evidence regarding their damages. 
 23 

million of damages based on the amounts awarded by the jury, as well as doubling of the economic damages and offsetting of any insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. Under Oregon Revised Statutes 82.010, interest at a rate of per annum will accrue on the judgment commencing at the date the judgment was entered until the entire money award is paid, amended or reversed by an appellate court. In January 2024, PacifiCorp filed a notice of appeal associated with the June 2023 verdict in James , including whether the case can proceed as a class action and filed a motion to stay further damages phase trials. On February 14, 2024, the Oregon Court of Appeals denied PacifiCorp's request to stay the damages phase trials. On February 13, 2024, the named plaintiffs filed a notice of cross-appeal as to the January 2024 limited judgment and money award. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. 
 
 In January 2024, the jury for the first James damages phase trial awarded plaintiffs million of damages, including million of economic damages and million of noneconomic damages. After the jury verdict, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon doubled the economic damages to million and added million of punitive damages using the multiplier determined by the jury for the June 2023 James verdict, bringing the total damages awarded to million. PacifiCorp requested that the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon judge offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the plaintiffs, and on March 25, 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon granted in large part the offset request. In April 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon entered a limited judgment and money award for the January 2024 James verdict. The limited judgment awards million of damages based on the amounts awarded by the jury and offsetting insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. In April 2024, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. PacifiCorp amended its January 2024 appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the January 2024 jury verdict. 
 
 In March 2024, the jury for the second James damages phase trial awarded plaintiffs million of damages, including million of doubled economic damages, million of noneconomic damages and million of punitive damages using the multiplier determined by the jury for the June 2023 James verdict. PacifiCorp requested that the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon judge offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the plaintiffs and on May 6, 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon granted the offset request. In June 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon entered a limited judgment and money award for the March 2024 James verdict. The limited judgment awards million of damages based on the amounts awarded by the jury and offsetting insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. In July 2024, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. PacifiCorp further amended its appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the March 2024 jury verdict. 
 
 In March 2024, settlement was reached with commercial timber plaintiffs in the James consolidated cases, and the jury trial scheduled for April 2024 was cancelled. 
 
 In April, May, July and September 2024, separate mass complaints against PacifiCorp naming individual class members were filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon referencing James as the lead case. These James mass complaints make damages only allegations seeking economic, noneconomic and punitive damages, as well as doubling of economic damages. PacifiCorp believes the magnitude of damages sought by the class members in the James mass complaints to be of remote likelihood of being awarded based on the amounts awarded in the jury verdicts described above that are being appealed. 
 
 In October 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon issued a case management order, which sets forth additional damages phase trials with plaintiffs per trial. The trials are scheduled to begin February 3, March 24, April 21, May 12, June 2, July 7, September 9, October 6 and December 7, 2025. 
 
 2022 McKinney Fire 
 
 According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, a wildfire began on July 29, 2022, in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California located in PacifiCorp's service territory, burning over 60,000 acres. Third-party reports indicate that the 2022 McKinney Fire resulted in 11 structures damaged; 185 structures destroyed, including residences; 12 injuries; and four fatalities. The cause of the 2022 McKinney Fire is undetermined and remains under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. 
 24 

million through September 30, 2024. PacifiCorp's cumulative accrual includes estimates of probable losses for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that it is reasonably able to estimate at this time and which is subject to change as additional relevant information becomes available. 
 
 Through September 30, 2024, PacifiCorp paid million in settlements associated with the Wildfires. As a result of the settlements, various trials have been cancelled.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million of PacifiCorp's liability for estimated losses associated with the Wildfires was included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts reflected as current as of September 30, 2024 reflect amounts reasonably expected to be paid out within the next year based on settlements reached as well as ongoing settlement and mediation efforts. The remainder of PacifiCorp's liability for estimated losses associated with the Wildfires as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was included in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of December 31, 2023, million of PacifiCorp's receivable for expected insurance recoveries was included in Other current assets while the remaining million was included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Insurance proceeds received to date relate to the 2020 Wildfires.

and million, respectively. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, PacifiCorp recognized probable losses net of expected insurance recoveries associated with the Wildfires of million and million, respectively. No additional insurance recoveries beyond those accrued and received to date are expected to be available. 
 
 It is reasonably possible PacifiCorp will incur material additional losses beyond the amounts accrued for the Wildfires that could have a material adverse effect on PacifiCorp's financial condition. PacifiCorp is currently unable to reasonably estimate a specific range of possible additional losses that could be incurred due to the number of properties and parties involved, including claimants in the class to the James case, the variation in the types of properties and damages and the ultimate outcome of legal actions. 
 
 HomeServices Antitrust Cases 
 
 HomeServices is currently defending against several antitrust cases, all in federal district courts. In each case, plaintiffs claim HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries (in one instance, HomeServices and BHE) conspired with co-defendants to artificially inflate real estate commissions by following and enforcing multiple listing service ("MLS") rules that require listing agents to offer a commission split to cooperating agents in order for the property to appear on the MLS ("Cooperative Compensation Rule"). None of the complaints specify damages sought. However, cases allege Texas state law deceptive trade practices claims, for which plaintiffs have provided written notice of the damages sought totaling approximately billion by separate notice as required by Texas law. 
 
 In April 2019, the Burnett (formerly Sitzer) et al. v. HomeServices of America, Inc. et al. complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri (the "Burnett case"). This lawsuit, which was certified as a class in April 2022, was originally brought on behalf of named plaintiffs Joshua Sitzer and Amy Winger against the National Association of Realtors ("NAR"), Anywhere Real Estate, HomeServices of America, Inc., RE/MAX, LLC, and Keller Williams Realty, Inc. HSF Affiliates, LLC and BHH Affiliates, LLC, each a subsidiary of HomeServices, were subsequently added as defendants. Rhonda Burnett became a lead class plaintiff in June 2021. The jury trial commenced on October 16, 2023, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs on October 31, 2023, finding that the named defendants participated in a conspiracy to follow and enforce the Cooperative Compensation Rule, which conspiracy had the purpose or effect of raising, inflating, or stabilizing broker commission rates paid by home sellers. The jury further found that the class plaintiffs had proved damages in the amount of billion. Joint and several liability applies for the co-defendants. Federal law authorizes trebling of damages and the award of pre-judgment interest and attorney fees. Prior to the trial, Anywhere Real Estate and RE/MAX, LLC reached settlement agreements with the plaintiffs. Subsequent to the trial, settlements were reached by Keller Williams, NAR and HomeServices on February 1, 2024, March 15, 2024, and April 25, 2024, respectively. The Anywhere Real Estate, RE/MAX, LLC and Keller Williams settlements received court approval on May 9, 2024, which has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The NAR and HomeServices settlements are subject to court approval, which is scheduled for November 26, 2024. Final judgment has not yet been entered by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. 
 
 In April 2024, HomeServices agreed to terms with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted against HomeServices, HSF Affiliates, LLC and BHH Affiliates, LLC in the Burnett case as part of a proposed nationwide class settlement. The final settlement agreement includes scheduled payments over the next aggregating million. HomeServices recognized an after-tax charge of approximately million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. If the settlement is not approved by the court, HomeServices intends to vigorously appeal on multiple grounds the jury's findings and damage award in the Burnett case, including whether the case can proceed as a class action. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. 
 
 Guarantees

 Earnings on common shares increased 1,489 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023. Included in these results was a pre-tax gain in the third quarter of 2024 of 255 million 202 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax loss in the third quarter of 2023 of 69 million 54 million after-tax) related to the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted earnings on common shares for the third quarter of 2024 was 1,773 million, an increase of 1,233 million, or 228 , compared to adjusted earnings on common shares for the third quarter of 2023 of 540 million. 
 
 Earnings on common shares increased 1,049 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Included in these results was a pre-tax gain in the first nine months of 2024 of 444 million 351 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax gain in the first nine months of 2023 of 915 million 723 million after-tax) related to the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited.

 34 

The increases in earnings on common shares for the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 were primarily due to the following: 
 The Utilities' earnings increased 979 million for the third quarter and 1,029 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Wildfire loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, were 1,263 million lower for the third quarter and 1,420 million lower for the first nine months of 2024. The increases also included higher PTCs, higher electric utility margin, higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and increased interest and dividend income, partially offset by increased operations and maintenance expense and higher interest expense. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.6 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher customer usage and an increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather; 
 Northern Powergrid's earnings increased 92 million for the third quarter and 220 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher distribution revenue and lower income tax expense from charges recognized in 2023 related to the Energy Profits Levy income tax and a group relief tax claim recognized in 2024, partially offset by unfavorable operating performance at the gas exploration business and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation and amortization expenses. Units distributed increased 0.9 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 mainly due to higher customer usage; 
 BHE Pipeline Group's earnings increased 19 million for the third quarter and 196 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of an additional 50 limited partner interest in Cove Point on September 1, 2023, and higher transportation revenue and higher margin on gas sales from system balancing activities at Northern Natural Gas; 
 BHE Renewables' earnings decreased 27 million for the third quarter and 73 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower earnings from the wind tax equity investment portfolio and gains on the extinguishment of debt recognized in the second quarter of 2023 and lower geothermal and natural gas earnings from lower pricing and generation, partially offset by higher earnings from the retail energy services business, largely due to favorable changes in unrealized positions on derivative contracts, and higher solar earnings from higher generation; 
 HomeServices' earnings decreased 5 million for the third quarter and 121 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a charge of approximately 140 million recognized in the first quarter of 2024 associated with a settlement reached in the ongoing real estate industry litigation matters offset by higher mortgage earnings from lower compensation and occupancy costs and higher revenue due to an increase in average loan size caused by lower inventory driving an increase in average home sales prices; and 
 BHE and Other's earnings increased 428 million for the third quarter and decreased 218 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. The changes included a favorable comparative change of 256 million in the third quarter and an unfavorable comparative change of 372 million for the first nine months of 2024 related to the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited as well as 124 million of higher federal income tax credits recognized on a consolidated basis. 
 
 Reportable Segment Results 
 
 PacifiCorp 
 
 Operating revenue increased 247 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher retail revenues of 248 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to price impacts of 195 million from higher average rates, largely from tariff changes, and 53 million from higher retail volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 3.2 , primarily due to higher customer usage and an increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. 
 
 Earnings increased 977 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower wildfire loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, of 1,263 million, higher utility margin of 49 million, increased allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of 30 million and higher interest and dividend income of 19 million. These items were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense of 65 million and increased interest expense of 53 million due to the debt issuance in January 2024. Utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail rates and volumes and lower thermal generation costs, partially offset by unfavorable deferred net power costs and higher purchased power costs. Operations and maintenance expense increased due to higher insurance premiums, increased vegetation management and other wildfire mitigation costs, higher salary and benefit expenses and higher amortization of demand-side management costs. 
 
 35 

Operating revenue increased 473 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher retail revenues of 516 million, partially offset by lower wholesale and other revenue of 43 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to price impacts of 397 million from higher average rates, largely from tariff changes, and 119 million from higher retail volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 3.2 , primarily due to higher customer usage and an increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Wholesale and other revenue decreased mainly due to lower wholesale volumes and lower average wholesale prices, partially offset by higher wheeling revenue. 
 
 Earnings increased 1,028 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower wildfire loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, of 1,420 million, higher utility margin of 137 million, increased allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of 99 million and higher interest and dividend income of 82 million.

PacifiCorp 
 
 Utah 
 
 In May 2023, PacifiCorp filed its energy balancing account application to recover deferred net power costs from 2022. The filing requested a rate increase of 98 million, or 4.6 , which was effective on an interim basis July 1, 2023. The UPSC held a hearing in January 2024 and issued final approval in February 2024. 
 
 In May 2024, PacifiCorp filed its energy balancing account application to recover deferred net power costs from 2023. The filing requested an increase of 280 million to what is currently in rates, which PacifiCorp proposed to recover over a two year period with interest, resulting in a first-year rate increase of 52 million, or 2.4 , effective on an interim basis July 1, 2024. In June 2024, the UPSC approved an interim rate change effective July 1, 2024. As part of the interim rate change, the UPSC rejected PacifiCorp's proposal to recover the incremental costs over two years, resulting in a rate increase of 256 million, or 11.6 . 
 
 In June 2024, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case requesting a rate increase of 667 million over two years. The request sought an increase of 382 million, or 16.2 , effective February 28, 2025, and a second increase of 285 million, or 12.1 , effective January 1, 2026. The request included increased energy costs, capital investments in transmission and wind powered generating facilities and higher insurance premiums for third-party liability coverage. In August 2024, PacifiCorp filed an amended application that removed the second rate increase that was associated with net power costs and updated costs associated with insurance premiums. The amended filing requested a rate increase of 394 million, or 16.7 , effective February 23, 2025. In October 2024, in response to dispositive motions filed by intervenors, the UPSC ordered that the test period costs associated with insurance premiums and wildfire mitigation be removed from the general rate case and consolidated into the separate existing dockets the insurance premium deferral proceeding and the approval of the wildfire mitigation plan, respectively. The UPSC required that the parties meet to determine "placeholder" amounts for these items in the general rate case pending final decisions in the other proceedings. PacifiCorp filed an objection to the decision in October 2024. Subsequently in October 2024, the UPSC affirmed the order and asked for additional comments from parties on timing and consolidation with a potential effective date for all matters by April 25, 2025. 
 
 Oregon 
 
 In February 2024, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case requesting a rate increase of 322 million, or 17.9 , to become effective January 1, 2025. The request included new capital investments in transmission and wind-powered generating facilities, higher insurance premiums for third-party liability coverage and proposed funding for a catastrophic fire fund. In July 2024, PacifiCorp filed updated testimony that removed the proposed funding for a catastrophic fire fund and included a reduction in the requested return on equity. As a result of the updates, the requested rate increase was revised to 214 million, or 11.9 . In August 2024, PacifiCorp filed updated testimony in which the requested rate increase was revised to 208 million, or 11.2 . 
 
 In February 2024, PacifiCorp filed its transition adjustment mechanism requesting approval to update net power costs for 2025. The filing requested a rate decrease of 18 million, or 1.0 , subject to updates throughout the course of the proceeding, to become effective January 1, 2025. In July 2024, a joint stipulation and supporting testimony was filed settling all issues. Concurrent with the stipulation, PacifiCorp filed its transition adjustment mechanism reply update, which reflected a total rate decrease of 23 million, or 1.3 , subject to final net power cost updates in November 2024. The OPUC approved the joint stipulation in September 2024. 
 
 In May 2024, PacifiCorp filed its 2023 PCAM requesting recovery of the difference between actual net power costs and base net power costs established in the 2023 transition adjustment mechanism. The filing requested recovery of 122 million, which PacifiCorp proposed to recover over a two year period with interest, resulting in a rate increase of 64 million, or 3.5 , effective October 1, 2024. In October 2024, a joint stipulation and supporting joint brief was filed settling all issues. Under the stipulation, PacifiCorp would recover 118 million over a two year period with interest, resulting in a non-residential rate increase of 37 million, or 2.0 , effective December 1, 2024, and a residential rate increase of 26 million, or 1.4 , effective April 1, 2025. A final decision from the OPUC is pending.

Wyoming 
 
 In March 2023, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case requesting a rate increase of 140 million, or 21.6 , to become effective January 1, 2024. The requested rate increase included recovery of increases in net power costs and new major capital investments in transmission and wind-powered generating facilities. In September 2023, PacifiCorp filed updated testimony that included updated net power costs and increased insurance premium costs associated with third-party liability coverage. In November 2023, the WPSC approved a rate increase of 54 million, or 8.3 , effective January 1, 2024. The approved rate increase reflected a reduction in the requested return on equity compared to what was sought by PacifiCorp, the exclusion of the increased insurance premium costs and a reduction in net power costs determined by the WPSC. The WPSC's reduction in net power costs reflects the exclusion of the costs associated with the Washington Cap and Invest program. In January 2024, PacifiCorp filed an application for rehearing requesting the WPSC consider three items, including the WPSC's net power costs adjustment, costs associated with the Washington Cap and Invest program and the opportunity to revise PacifiCorp's initial revenue requirement request for updates, corrections and revisions reflected in rebuttal testimony. In April 2024, the WPSC denied a rehearing in an open meeting, and PacifiCorp is pursuing review of this decision in federal and state courts in Wyoming. 
 
 In April 2024, PacifiCorp filed its energy cost adjustment and renewable energy credit and sulfur dioxide credit mechanisms to recover deferred net power costs from 2023. The combined filing requested a rate increase of 86 million, or 12.3 , to be effective on an interim basis on July 1, 2024. In June 2024, PacifiCorp updated the filing to reduce the amount of deferred net power costs included in the request by 2 million. In July 2024, the WPSC approved an interim rate increase of 84 million, or 11.9 , effective July 1, 2024.

 Washington 
 
 In March 2023, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case requesting a two-year rate plan with a rate increase that included recovery of increases in net power costs and new major capital investments in transmission and wind-powered generating facilities. In October 2023, PacifiCorp filed updated testimony that included updated net power costs, increased insurance premium costs and removal of some capital projects. In December 2023, a multi-party settlement stipulation was filed to update the requested rate increase to 14 million, or 3.4 , to become effective March 19, 2024, and 21 million, or 5.0 , to become effective March 1, 2025. A hearing on the settlement stipulation was held in January 2024, and the WUTC accepted the stipulation on March 19, 2024. PacifiCorp submitted the required compliance filings with an updated net power cost forecast, resulting in a rate increase of 11 million, or 2.7 , effective April 3, 2024. 
 
 In June 2023, PacifiCorp filed its PCAM to recover deferred net power costs from 2022. The filing requested recovery of over 71 million, which PacifiCorp proposed to recover over a two-year period with interest, resulting in a rate increase of 37 million, or 9.5 , to become effective January 1, 2024. In November 2023, the WUTC suspended PacifiCorp's PCAM filing in response to an intervening party's petition for adjudication request. PacifiCorp's hedging practices were evaluated in the adjudicative proceeding that was heard in June 2024. On October 30, 2024, the WUTC found that PacifiCorp's hedging practices were prudent for 2022 and approved recovery of 70 million of net power costs over a two-year period. 
 
 In June 2024, PacifiCorp filed its PCAM to recover deferred net power costs from 2023. The filing requested a rate increase of 81 million, or 20.0 , effective October 1, 2024. In September 2024, the WUTC suspended PacifiCorp's 2023 PCAM filing in response to WUTC staff's submission for adjudication due to the pending nature of the 2022 PCAM. 
 
 Idaho 
 
 In April 2024, PacifiCorp filed its energy cost adjustment mechanism to recover deferred net power costs from 2023. The filing requested a rate increase of 33 million, or 10.5 , effective June 1, 2024. In May 2024, the IPUC approved a rate increase of 30 million, or 9.7 , effective June 1, 2024, that excluded costs associated with the Washington Cap and Invest program. In June 2024, PacifiCorp filed a petition for reconsideration of the disallowed costs, and in July 2024, the IPUC granted the request for reconsideration. PacifiCorp filed comments in September 2024, and an IPUC decision on the petition for reconsideration is pending. 
 
 46 

In May 2024, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case requesting a rate increase of 92 million over two years. The request seeks an increase of 66 million, or 19.4 , effective January 1, 2025, and a second increase of 26 million, or 7.4 , effective January 1, 2026. The request included increased energy costs, capital investments in transmission and wind powered generating facilities, higher insurance premiums for third-party liability coverage and proposed funding for a catastrophic fire fund. In October 2024, the IPUC issued a notice of suspension regarding PacifiCorp's general rate case application, suspending the rate effective date for 60 days, from January 1, 2025, to March 2, 2025. The notice also authorized PacifiCorp to track for future recovery the revenue requirement increase ultimately granted by the IPUC from January 1, 2025, until the new rates become effective. 
 
 California 
 
 In September 2023, PacifiCorp filed its 2024 combined ECAC and GHG related costs application requesting an overall rate increase of 30 million, or 25.0 , effective March 1, 2024. Approximately 36 million of the increase is attributed to the ECAC rate, which is offset by a 6 million decrease to the GHG rate. In January 2024, PacifiCorp filed a joint motion for approval of the GHG portion of the filing. In March 2024, the CPUC approved the joint motion and the GHG related changes went into effect March 12, 2024 and April 1, 2024. In June 2024, PacifiCorp filed a joint motion for approval to settle the ECAC portion of the filing. The joint motion would result in an overall rate increase of 23 million, or 19.3 . The ECAC settlement adjusted the ECAC balancing rate to be amortized over 21 months and maintained a one-year amortization for the ECAC offset rate. PacifiCorp anticipates a final CPUC decision approving the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 In September 2024, PacifiCorp filed to recover costs recorded in the catastrophic events memorandum account requesting a rate increase of 15 million, or 10.2 , over approximately two years, effective March 1, 2025. 
 
 Deferral Accounting Treatment for Increased Costs Associated with Wildfires 
 
 In June 2023, PacifiCorp filed an application with the CPUC for authority to establish a Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account to track the costs associated with third-party liability from litigation due to the 2020 Wildfires, increased insurance premium costs associated with third-party liability coverage and costs associated with potential liability for future catastrophic wildfires. The CPUC issued a proposed decision in February 2024; however, in March 2024, PacifiCorp filed a motion to stay the proceeding in order to re-evaluate the allocation of wildfire liability costs to California customers, and in April 2024, the CPUC granted the stay until December 2024. 
 
 In August 2023, PacifiCorp filed deferral applications with the UPSC, the OPUC, the WUTC and the IPUC for costs associated with increased insurance premium costs associated with third-party liability coverage. In December 2023, PacifiCorp filed a deferral application with the WPSC for the increased insurance premium costs. The IPUC and the OPUC approved the request for authorization to defer the increased insurance premium costs in December 2023 and January 2024, respectively. In March 2024, the UPSC denied the application for deferral accounting. In April 2024, PacifiCorp filed a request for review and reconsideration of the legal conclusions in the UPSC order. In May 2024, the UPSC granted PacifiCorp's application for rehearing, and scheduling conferences are ongoing. In October 2024, the WPSC approved an August 2024 all-party stipulation allowing for deferred accounting for the increased insurance premium costs. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy 
 
 Iowa 
 
 In June 2023, MidAmerican Energy filed a request with the IUC for an increase in its Iowa retail natural gas rates, which would increase revenue by 39 million annually or increase retail customer's bills by an average of 6.1 . Interim rates of 31 million annually, or an average increase to customer's bills of 4.8 , were effective in June 2023. In January 2024, MidAmerican Energy filed a non-unanimous settlement with the Office of Consumer Advocate, which would allow for an increase in revenue of 30 million annually, or an average increase to customer's bills of 4.6 . On March 29, 2024, the IUC issued its order approving the non-unanimous settlement agreement and final rates were implemented on July 1, 2024.

Iowa Transmission Legislation 
 
 In June 2020, Iowa enacted legislation that grants incumbent electric transmission owners the right to construct, own and maintain electric transmission lines that have been approved for construction in a federally registered planning authority's transmission plan and that connect to the incumbent electric transmission owner's facility. This Right of First Refusal ("ROFR") law gave MidAmerican Energy, as an incumbent electric transmission owner, the legal right to construct, own and maintain transmission lines in MidAmerican Energy's service territory that have been approved by the MISO (or another federally registered planning authority) and are eligible to receive regional cost allocation. In October 2020, national transmission interests filed a lawsuit that challenged the law on state constitutional grounds. After an appeal in which the Iowa Supreme Court held the national transmission interests had standing to challenge the law and remanded the case to the Iowa district court for a decision on the merits, the district court, in December 2023, found the legislature impermissibly "log-rolled" the ROFR law into a state appropriations bill in violation of the title and single-subject provisions of the Iowa Constitution and held that the law was unconstitutional and unenforceable. The district court issued an injunction that enjoins MidAmerican Energy and ITC Midwest from further developing the Long Range Transmission Projects ("LRTP") Tranche 1 projects to the extent authority to construct was claimed pursuant to, under, or in reliance on the invalid ROFR law, but allows either company to proceed with projects assigned in a manner not relying on the claimed existence of the law. 
 
 In April 2024, MidAmerican Energy and ITC Midwest filed an appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court that challenges the application of the injunction to the LRTP Tranche 1 projects; MISO filed an amicus brief that supports the positions taken by MidAmerican Energy and ITC Midwest. The appeal remains pending before the Iowa Supreme Court, and MidAmerican Energy expects a ruling on the appeal by early to mid-2025. The district court injunction remains in effect while the appeal is pending. 
 
 In May 2024, MISO issued a public notice that advised it was proceeding with a variance analysis under its tariff to assess actions that could be taken to mitigate the obstacle to construct posed by the district court injunction. The notice confirmed the injunction did not change ownership of the projects or cause any project facility classification to be modified to a competitive transmission facility under MISO's tariff. It also confirmed the injunction did not suspend either company's obligation to construct the projects under MISO's tariff. In August 2024, MISO issued notice of the outcome of its variance analysis, determining that a mitigation plan was the appropriate outcome under the MISO tariff. As part of the mitigation plan, MISO's Competitive Transmission Executive Committee determined the projects should be assigned to the incumbent transmission owners under the transmission owners agreement, which results in no change to the project assignments. MISO's notice reaffirmed that MidAmerican Energy and ITC Midwest remain obligated to construct the projects under MISO's tariff. In October 2024, the national transmission interests filed a motion with the district court that asks the court to enforce the injunction and enjoin MidAmerican Energy and ITC Midwest from proceeding with the projects under MISO's mitigation plan. MidAmerican Energy is resisting the motion. 
 
 The litigation regarding the ROFR law would only affect the manner in which MidAmerican Energy would secure the right to construct transmission lines that are eligible for regional cost allocation and are otherwise subject to competitive bidding under the MISO tariff; it does not negatively affect or implicate MidAmerican Energy's ongoing rights to construct any other transmission lines, including lines required to serve new or expanded retail load, connect new generators or meet reliability criteria. 
 
 NV Energy (Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific) 
 
 Regulatory Rate Review 
 
 In February 2024, Sierra Pacific filed electric and gas regulatory rate reviews with the PUCN that requested annual revenue increases of 95 million, or 8.8 and 11 million, or 4.9 , respectively. Sierra Pacific filed the certification filing that updated the electric and gas filings to requested annual revenue increases of 96 million, or 9.5 and 12 million, or 6.4 , respectively. Hearings in the cost of capital phase were held in June 2024 and the hearings for the revenue requirement phase were held in July 2024. The hearings in the rate design phase were held in August 2024. In September 2024, the PUCN issued an order approving an increase in base rates for electric of 40 million and for gas of 8 million. In October 2024, Sierra Pacific filed a petition for reconsideration and clarification of the order. The petition for reconsideration is still pending a PUCN order.

BHE Pipeline Group 
 
 BHE GT S 
 
 In November 2023, Carolina Gas Transmission, LLC ("CGT") filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with proposed rates to be effective January 1, 2024. CGT's current rates were established by a 2011 settlement. CGT proposed an annual cost-of-service of 167 million, and requested increases in various rates, including Zone 1 general system transmission rates by 84 and Zone 2 general system transmission rates by 23 . In December 2023, the FERC suspended the rate changes for five months following the proposed effective date, until June 1, 2024, subject to refund. In August 2024, a settlement agreement was filed with the FERC, resolving CGT's general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services and providing for increased service rates and depreciation rates. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, CGT's rates result in an average annual increase to firm transmission revenues of 25 million over the settlement period and an increase in annual depreciation expense of 8 million, compared to the rates in effect prior to June 1, 2024. FERC approval of the settlement is expected late 2024 or early 2025. 
 
 BHE Transmission 
 
 AltaLink 
 
 2024-2025 General Tariff Application 
 
 In April 2023, AltaLink filed its 2024-2025 GTA with the AUC. In August 2023, AltaLink filed an amendment to its 2024-2025 GTA in response to the unprecedented wildfire events that AltaLink experienced in Alberta, Canada in May and June 2023. The amendment increased AltaLink's Wildfire Mitigation Plan capital expenditures from C 16 million to C 39 million in 2024 and from C 15 million to C 38 million for 2025. In December 2023, the AUC approved 2024 interim refundable transmission tariffs for AltaLink, including monthly tariffs for PLP and KLP, of C 74 million per month effective January 1, 2024. AltaLink advised the AUC that it reached a negotiated settlement with customer groups on the majority of its 2024-2025 GTA and filed the agreement with the AUC for approval in December 2023. In February 2024, the AUC issued its decision with respect to AltaLink's 2024-2025 GTA, approving the negotiated settlement agreement as filed. The agreement did not include AltaLink's proposed wildfire deferral account, certain components of the wildfire mitigation plan, and actual and forecast salvage expenditures from its 2019-2023 GTA and 2024-2025 GTA, respectively. 
 
 In June 2024, the AUC issued its decision with respect to AltaLink's 2024-2025 GTA and matters excluded from the negotiated settlement. The AUC approved the previously denied C 99 million actual salvage costs incurred from 2019 to 2021 and the 2022-2025 salvage expenditures of C 124 million, subject to changes arising from revised wildfire mitigation capital expenditures. The AUC also approved AltaLink's transition to the capitalization of site preparation or salvage costs for capital replacement projects starting in 2024. However, the AUC did not approve the recovery of C 11 million of debt and equity returns for 2022-2023 related to the previously denied C 99 million salvage costs. The AUC also approved C 29 million of forecast capital expenditures, including capitalized salvage, related to AltaLink's 2024-2025 Wildfire Mitigation Plan, which is generally consistent with the approved wildfire capital expenditures in AltaLink's 2022-2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. The AUC did not approve AltaLink's request, filed in August 2023, for an incremental C 46 million in forecast wildfire mitigation capital expenditures. The AUC denied AltaLink's proposed wildfire damages deferral account stating that AltaLink currently has multiple layers of protection to address the risk of liability for wildfire-related third-party damages. 
 
 AltaLink filed its compliance filing in August 2024 which also reflected the 9.28 return on equity for 2024 approved in the Generic Cost of Capital proceeding and the capitalization of site preparation costs as approved by the AUC. As a result, AltaLink's revised transmission tariffs are C 908 million for 2024 and C 914 million for 2025. 
 
 In September 2024, AltaLink responded to information requests from the AUC and one intervener on AltaLink's directive responses in its compliance filing related to wildfire mitigation. An AUC decision on the compliance filing is expected by the end of 2024.

2023 Wildfire and Storm Cost Recovery Application 
 
 In December 2023, AltaLink filed an application with the AUC to recover all costs incurred as a result of the 2023 spring wildfire and storm events. The application includes capital expenditures of C 19 million and salvage expenditures of C 6 million. In March 2024, AltaLink submitted responses to information requests. The AUC heard arguments in May 2024. In July 2024, the AUC approved, on an interim basis, the recovery of C 19 million of expenditures through the self-insurance reserve account over the 2024 and 2025 period. The AUC also approved C 6 million of salvage expenditures, on an interim basis, through the net salvage reserve account. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 Each Registrant is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact each Registrant's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. Each Registrant believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. The discussion below contains material developments to those matters disclosed in Item 1 of each Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and new environmental matters occurring in 2024. 
 
 Air Quality Regulations 
 
 The Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation's air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE's generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers.

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule 
 
 The EPA promulgated an initial rule in March 2005 to reduce emissions of NO x and SO 2 , precursors of ozone and particulate matter, from down-wind sources in the eastern U.S. to reduce emissions by implementing a plan based on a market-based cap-and-trade system, emissions reductions, or both. After numerous appeals, the CSAPR was promulgated to address interstate transport of SO 2 and NO x emissions in 27 Eastern and Midwestern states. In March 2022, the EPA released its Good Neighbor Rule, which contains proposed revisions to the CSAPR framework and is intended to address ozone transport for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. In March 2023, the EPA released the final Good Neighbor Rule. The electric generation sector remains the key industry regulated by the rule and will be subject to emissions allowance trading, which was slated to begin in summer 2023, but is on hold during the pendency of litigation. The final rule shifted the maximum daily backstop rate for coal-fueled generating units, which drives the installation of new controls or curtailment, to take effect in 2030 instead of 2027. PacifiCorp's Hunter Units 1-3 and Huntington Units 1-2, which do not have SCR controls, are impacted by the rule. PacifiCorp's 2023 IRP selected the installation of SNCR on the Hunter and Huntington Units by 2026 as part of the preferred portfolio. The level of NO x allowances for the Utah units remains similar to 2021 levels, with significant reductions for the coal units beginning in 2026. The daily limit, which takes effect in 2030, will further restrict operation of coal-fueled units without SCR. NV Energy's fossil-fueled units are also covered by the final rule. North Valmy Units 1 and 2, which do not have SCR, will require additional controls or reduced operations during the ozone season if operated beyond 2025. Nevada's regional haze SIP has an enforceable retirement date for North Valmy Units 1 and 2 of December 31, 2028, and NV Energy's IRP identified a December 31, 2025, retirement date for the units and is seeking a request of approval from the PUCN to convert the existing coal-fueled generating facility at the North Valmy Generating Station to a cleaner natural gas-fueled generating facility. The EPA also deferred final action for Wyoming, pending further review of updated air quality and contribution modeling and analysis. The EPA ultimately approved Wyoming's SIP in December 2023. Additional notice and comment rulemaking, such as a supplemental rule, would be required to rescind Iowa's approved SIP and incorporate additional states into the program. The states of Nevada, Utah and Wyoming challenged the EPA's denials and deferral, respectively, of their interstate ozone transport SIPs in the Ninth, Tenth and D.C. Circuits. PacifiCorp also filed petitions with the court opposing the EPA's action in Utah and Wyoming. At the time of filing, at least 11 other states have challenged the EPA's action to disapprove SIPs in seven different federal courts of appeal. Stays have been granted by six circuit courts for SIP disapprovals in 12 states. Relevant to Registrants, the states of Nevada, Texas and Utah were granted stays. The final Good Neighbor Rule was published June 5, 2023 and took effect August 4, 2023. The EPA issued several interim final rules stating that the federal rule will not take effect in states in which the SIP disapprovals have been deferred or stayed. In addition to litigation over SIP disapprovals, there are numerous appeals of the final Good Neighbor Rule pending in four different circuit courts, and at least four motions to stay the final rule have been filed in four different circuit courts. On September 25, 2023, the D.C. Circuit denied the motion to stay the Good Neighbor Rule filed by several state and industry parties. The denial means that states that do not have stays on their SIP disapprovals are subject to the Good Neighbor Rule. However, the states of Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia filed a request for stay of the Good Neighbor Rule with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 13, 2023. Several industry groups representing utilities as well as pipeline, paper, cement and other industries affected by the rule filed supportive requests for stay on the same day. The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the emergency stay requests on February 21, 2024, and granted the stay requests on June 27, 2024. Consequently, enforcement of the federal ozone transport rule is halted while litigation over the rule continues in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On October 10, 2024, the EPA sent for White House Office of Management and Budget pre-publication review an action further explaining how the Good Neighbor Rule can function with fewer states than the 23 originally intended, after the U.S. Supreme Court stayed its implementation over doubts about the program's viability and fairness. The rule addresses the D.C. Circuit's September 2024 partial remand of the rule's record. This response rule is anticipated to be issued by the end of 2024. 
 
 For the first time, the EPA included additional sectors beyond the electric generation sector in the 2023 expanded CSAPR program. Relevant to the Registrants, this includes the pipeline transportation of natural gas. Requirements for that sector focus on emissions reductions from reciprocating internal combustion engines involved in the transport of natural gas and take effect in 2026. There is no access to allowance trading for the non-electric generation sectors. The EPA excluded emergency engines and engines that do not operate during the ozone season, included a facility-wide averaging plan and eased requirements for monitoring in the final rule. BHE GT S operates 157 affected units; Northern Natural Gas operates 18 affected units; and Kern River is not affected by the final rule. 
 
 On a parallel track, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a motion filed by the EPA on February 27, 2024, transferring the Utah and Oklahoma SIP disapproval litigation to the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit granted a request to abate the litigation while PacifiCorp, Utah and other petitioners sought a review of the transfer order before the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court announced on October 21, 2024, that it would hear this and a related case concerning proper venue under the Clean Air Act. Arguments are anticipated to take place in spring 2025, with a decision by June 2025. In a July 5, 2024, motion filed with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the EPA asked the court to consolidate and expedite all the remaining cases on the Ozone Transport Rule. The agency proposed a briefing schedule that would have opening briefs filed August 20, 2024, and final briefs filed November 12, 2024, with oral argument set before the end of 2024. On July 26, 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals continued abatement of the case until the U.S. Supreme Court acts on the petitions.

On January 24, 2024, the EPA released a supplemental proposal to expand the Good Neighbor Plan to an additional five states - Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, New Mexico and Tennessee. The EPA cites new modeling showing the states' significant contribution to ozone problems in downwind states. Under the proposal, fossil-fueled generating facilities in these five states would be required to participate in the allowance-based ozone season nitrogen oxides emissions trading program beginning in 2025. Relevant to the Registrants, the new state budget for Iowa was determined by optimizing existing post-combustion controls and installation of neural networks. It does not appear that Iowa's revised budget would require additional emissions control equipment because the EPA determined that Iowa contributed to downwind monitor violations only in 2023 (the base year for the Good Neighbor Plan) and not in 2026 (the latest compliance date under the Good Neighbor Plan). However, because the EPA determined that Arizona contributes to modeled violations in both 2023 and 2026, the requirements for that state are more stringent and may drive installation of additional controls. The EPA accepted comments on the supplemental proposal through May 16, 2024. The EPA submitted the final supplemental rule for interagency review in September 2024 and it is anticipated that the final supplemental rule will be issued by the end of 2024. 
 
 Until additional rulemaking is completed and litigation is exhausted, the potential impacts to the relevant Registrants cannot be determined. 
 
 Regional Haze 
 
 The EPA's Regional Haze Rule, finalized in 1999, requires states to develop and implement plans to improve visibility in designated federally protected areas ("Class I areas"). Some of PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities in Utah, Wyoming, Arizona and Colorado and certain of Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's fossil-fueled generating facilities are subject to the Clean Air Visibility Rules. In accordance with the federal requirements, states are required to submit SIPs that address emissions from sources subject to visibility requirements and demonstrate progress towards achieving natural visibility requirements in Class I areas by 2064.

The state of Wyoming issued two regional haze SIPs requiring the installation of SO 2 , NO x and particulate matter controls on certain PacifiCorp coal-fueled generating facilities in Wyoming. The EPA approved the SO 2 SIP in December 2012 and the EPA's approval was upheld on appeal by the Tenth Circuit in October 2014. The EPA's final action on the Wyoming SIP in 2014 approved the state's plan to have PacifiCorp install low-NO x burners at Naughton Units 1 and 2, SCR controls at Naughton Unit 3 by December 2014, SCR controls at Jim Bridger Units 1 through 4 between 2015 and 2022, and low-NO x burners at Dave Johnston Unit 4. The EPA disapproved a portion of the Wyoming SIP and issued a FIP for Dave Johnston Unit 3, where it required the installation of SCR controls by 2019 or, in lieu of installing SCR controls, a commitment to shut down Dave Johnston Unit 3 by 2027, its currently approved depreciable life. The EPA also disapproved a portion of the Wyoming SIP and issued a FIP for the Wyodak coal-fueled generating facility, requiring the installation of SCR controls by 2019. PacifiCorp filed an appeal of the EPA's final action on Wyodak in March 2014. The state of Wyoming and several environmental groups also filed an appeal of the EPA's final action. In September 2014, the Tenth Circuit issued a stay of the March 2019 compliance deadline for Wyodak, pending further action by the Tenth Circuit in the appeal. The parties worked to mediate claims under the Wyoming regional haze requirements until the abatement on litigation was lifted in September 2022. On August 15, 2023, the Tenth Circuit ruled in favor of Wyoming and remanded the Wyodak portion of Wyoming's state plan to EPA for further review, with instructions to give appropriate deference to the state's determinations. For Naughton Units 1 and 2, the court determined the EPA properly approved Wyoming's Naughton determination and denied environmental groups' petition. Separately, on February 14, 2022, the First Judicial District Court for the State of Wyoming entered a consent decree reached between the state of Wyoming and PacifiCorp resolving claims of threatened violations of the Clean Air Act, the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act and the Wyoming Air Quality Standards and Regulations at the Jim Bridger facility. No penalties were imposed under the consent decree. Consistent with the terms and conditions of the consent decree, PacifiCorp must convert Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 to natural gas and begin meeting emissions limits consistent with that conversion by January 1, 2024. The EPA and PacifiCorp executed an administrative order on consent on June 9, 2022, covering compliance for Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 under the regional haze rule. The federal order contains the same emission and operating limits as the Wyoming consent decree and adds federal approval of the compliance pathway outlined in the state consent decree, including revision of the SIP to include conversion of Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 to natural gas. The order includes a one-year deadline to complete the SIP revision. On December 30, 2022, the Wyoming Air Quality Division submitted the state-approved revised regional haze SIP requiring natural gas conversion of Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 to the EPA for approval. The plan revision replaces a previous requirement for selective catalytic reduction at the units. The Wyoming Air Quality Division also issued an air permit for the natural gas conversion of Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 on December 28, 2022. PacifiCorp submitted a notice of compliance to the EPA on March 9, 2023, to certify completion of the Jim Bridger administrative compliance order requirements through compliance with the Wyoming consent decree and Wyoming's revised SIP submission. PacifiCorp remains subject to the compliance terms of the Wyoming consent decree as it works to convert Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 to natural gas. On April 10, 2024, the EPA proposed approval of Wyoming's regional haze SIP revision for the first planning period. The SIP includes enforceable emissions and heat input limits at Jim Bridger units 1 and 2, consistent with the conversion of those units to natural gas. The EPA accepted comments on the proposed approval through May 10, 2024, and final action is anticipated by fall 2024.

Nevada, Utah and Wyoming each submitted regional haze SIPs for the regional haze second planning period to the EPA and received completeness determinations in August 2022. The EPA was required to make final determinations on the SIPs by August 2023. The states of Utah and Wyoming filed deadline suits in the Utah and Wyoming federal district courts in October and November 2023, respectively, asking the court to require the EPA to perform its statutory duty to approve or disapprove the states' regional haze second planning period SIPs. PacifiCorp also filed a deadline suit in both courts. Three environmental groups filed similar deadline suits in the federal district court in Washington, D.C. for seven different states on June 15, 2023. The environmental groups amended their lawsuit on November 10, 2023, after Wyoming and PacifiCorp's suits were filed, to include Utah's and Wyoming's state plans. PacifiCorp intervened in the D.C. district court case and asked that court to stay the Utah and Wyoming cases in that court while they proceed in the relevant federal courts in Utah and Wyoming. The EPA published a proposed regional haze second planning period settlement agreement with environmental groups on March 29, 2024, that would require the agency to take final action approving or denying SIPs under a rolling series of deadlines through 2026. The proposed consent decree was subject to public comments through April 29, 2024, before being adopted by the court on July 12, 2024. The consent decree sets final deadlines for the EPA to approve or disapprove the haze plans of 32 states. Relevant to the Registrants, the EPA would be required to take final action on Utah's and Wyoming's plans by November 22, 2024; Texas' plan by May 30, 2025; and Nevada's plan by December 15, 2025. Utah, Wyoming and PacifiCorp withdrew the deadline suits in their respective state federal district courts. On August 1, 2024, the EPA proposed to partially approve and partially disapprove Wyoming's SIP for the second planning period and accepted comments on the proposal through September 3, 2024. On August 19, 2024, the EPA proposed to partially approve and partially disapprove Utah's SIP for the second planning period and accepted comments on the proposal through September 18, 2024. Should the EPA finalize the proposed disapproval, it is required to impose a federal implementation plan within two years unless Wyoming and Utah submit a new plan that the agency approves. On October 15, 2024, the EPA proposed to partially approve and partially disapprove Texas' SIP for the second planning period and will accept comments on the proposal through November 14, 2024. Until the cases are resolved and additional rulemaking is completed by the EPA, any potential impacts to the relevant Registrants cannot be determined. 
 
 In August 2023, the Nevada Utilities filed a Joint Application for approval of the Fifth Amendment to the 2021 Joint Integrated Resource Plan. The Fifth Amendment seeks, in part, to convert the existing coal-fueled North Valmy Generating Station to natural gas and to continue operation of Tracy units 4 and 5 to 2049. Based on this filing, the state of Nevada partially withdrew portions of the State Implementation plan for Regional Haze to re-evaluate emission control measures that may be necessary to achieve reasonable progress during the second implementation period of the Regional Haze Rule in Nevada. The state of Nevada expects to submit a revised SIP to the EPA in early 2025, allowing sufficient time for the EPA to act on the plan according to the schedule in the March 2024 consent decree. 
 
 On August 25, 2022, the EPA promulgated a finding of failure to submit a SIP for the regional haze second planning period for 15 states, including Iowa. The finding establishes a two-year deadline for the agency to promulgate FIPs to address the requirements, unless prior to promulgating a FIP, the state submits, and the agency approves, a SIP meeting the requirements. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources issued a SIP in August 2023 that requires operational improvements to existing control equipment at MidAmerican Energy's Louisa Generation Station and Walter Scott, Jr. Energy Center - Unit 3. Iowa submitted that plan to the EPA in fall 2023. On August 2, 2024, the EPA proposed a rule to approve Iowa's SIP as submitted. The EPA accepted comment on the proposal through September 3, 2024. Final action on the SIP is anticipated by the end of 2024.

Federal Greenhouse Gas Standards 
 
 In June 2014, the EPA released proposed regulations to address GHG emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating facilities, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA's proposal calculated state-specific emission rate targets to be achieved based on the "best system of emission reduction." In August 2015, the final Clean Power Plan was released, which established the best system of emission reduction as including: (a) heat rate improvements; (b) increased utilization of existing combined-cycle natural gas-fueled generating facilities; and (c) increased deployment of new and incremental non-carbon generation placed in-service after 2012. The Clean Power Plan was stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2016. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emission reduction for existing coal-fueled generating facilities is limited to actions that result in heat rate improvements at individual units. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the Affordable Clean Energy rule to the EPA, finding that the rule "rested critically on a mistaken reading of the Clean Air Act" that limited the best system of emission reduction to actions taken at a facility. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of that decision. The U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision regarding the scope of the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act in June 2022. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the "generation shifting" approach in the Clean Power Plan exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress, although the court did not address whether the EPA may only adopt measures applied at the individual source as it did in the Affordable Clean Energy rule. A key area where the EPA went astray was using the Clean Power Plan to give states the option to promulgate regulations that would encourage "generation shifting," or moving away from higher-polluting power sources like coal to lower-polluting sources like natural gas or renewables. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's vacatur of the Affordable Clean Energy rule and remanded the case for further proceedings. In May 2023, the EPA proposed rules addressing greenhouse gas emissions from new and reconstructed natural gas-fueled combustion turbines (Clean Air Act Section 111(b) rule) and existing coal- and gas- or oil-fueled steam units and natural gas-fueled combustion turbines (Clean Air Act Section 111(d) rule). On April 25, 2024, the EPA finalized rules setting greenhouse gas emissions standards for new natural gas-fueled combustion turbines and existing coal-, gas- and oil-fueled steam units. The EPA deferred action on emissions standards for existing natural gas-fueled combustion turbines. New natural gas-fueled combustion turbines are expected to utilize lower-emitting fuels and operate as highly efficient generation. Additionally, new baseload combustion turbines exceeding a 40 annual capacity factor must meet an emission limit equivalent to operating with carbon capture and sequestration beginning January 1, 2032. The EPA identified carbon capture and sequestration as the technology basis for the emissions standards for coal units. Coal-fueled units that will operate after December 31, 2038, must meet emission limits equivalent to operating with carbon capture and sequestration beginning January 1, 2032. Other units are anticipated to co-fire with natural gas and retire prior to January 1, 2039 or convert to natural gas operations and meeting emission limits corresponding to capacity factors. Emission limits for individual generating units must be specified in state compliance plans, which must be submitted to EPA within 24 months of the rule's publication in the Federal Register. Facilities are not required to retrofit with carbon capture technology but must meet emission limits based on the technology. PacifiCorp operates 9 coal-fueled units and MidAmerican Energy operates 6 coal-fueled units that are currently not planned for retirement or conversion to natural gas operations by 2032, when the emissions standards would take effect. NV Energy operates one natural gas-fueled unit subject to limits for new sources. The relevant Registrants continue to evaluate the rule and business plans to identify flexible compliance mechanisms that minimize costs while assuring the delivery of safe and reliable energy to customers. Litigation challenging the final rules was filed the same day they were published. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals denied motions to stay the rules July 19, 2024, concluding the measure is not a "major question" requiring higher judicial scrutiny and that critics have not shown they will succeed on the merits of their claims. In addition, a three-judge panel of the court downplayed any "irreparable harm" that opponents of the rule would face while the litigation plays out. The court set an expedited briefing schedule in order to hear oral arguments in fall 2024. Emergency petitions to stay the rules were quickly filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. On October 16, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied petitions to stay the rule, concluding that applicants would not suffer irreparable harm since the case before the D.C. Circuit is proceeding on an expedited schedule. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently set oral arguments in the case for December 6, 2024; a decision is expected by June 2025. Until litigation is exhausted, the relevant Registrants cannot determine the full impacts of the final rule.

New Source Performance Standards for Methane Emissions 
 
 In August 2020, the EPA finalized regulations to rescind standards for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The changes eliminate requirements to regulate methane emissions from the production, processing, transmission and storage of oil and gas. The rule was immediately challenged by environmental and tribal groups, as well as numerous states. In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit lifted an administrative stay and allowed the rule to take effect, finding that groups challenging the rule had not met the standard for a long-term stay. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint resolution of Congress, adopted under the Congressional Review Act, disapproving the August 2020 rule. The resolution reinstated the 2012 volatile organic compounds standards and the 2016 volatile organic compounds and methane standards for the oil and natural gas transmission and storage segments, as well as the methane standards for the production and processing segments of the oil and gas sector. On November 2, 2021, the EPA proposed rules that would reduce methane emissions from both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The proposals would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and natural gas sources and would require states to reduce methane emissions from existing sources nationwide. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal in November 2022 to further strengthen emission reduction requirements. The EPA issued the final rule in December 2023, establishing emissions standards and leak detection and repair requirements for a number of components across the natural gas system. Kern River is not affected by the rule. Northern Natural Gas and BHE GT S are affected by the rule and anticipate replacing some pneumatic controllers at compressor stations and seals at centrifugal and reciprocating compressors. Additional leak detection and repair surveys and reports are also anticipated. States and industry groups are challenging the rule at the D.C. Circuit. Both the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court have denied petitions to stay the rule during litigation. In January 2024, the EPA proposed the methane fee rule, which is required under the Inflation Reduction Act. The fee, called a waste emissions charge, will be assessed on natural gas facilities that are subject to Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program Subpart W reporting. For transmission and storage operations, any facility that reports methane emissions over the congressionally-determined "0.11 of the methane sent to sale from or through such facility" will pay a fee to the federal government. The fee can be reduced by the netting of emissions, or altogether eliminated by certain statutory exemptions. The amount of the fee is scaled, beginning at 900 per metric ton of methane over the 0.11 threshold beginning in 2025 and increasing to 1,500 per metric ton of methane over the 0.11 threshold in 2027. The relevant Registrants do not expect significant impacts from the proposed fee rule due to the combination of the excess emissions threshold, netting allowance and compliance with the methane emissions standards rule. The EPA accepted comments on the proposed fee rule through March 11, 2024. Until the EPA takes final action on the proposal, the full impacts of the rule cannot be determined. 
 
 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards 
 
 In March 2011, the EPA proposed a rule that requires coal-fueled generating facilities to reduce mercury emissions and other hazardous air pollutants through the establishment of "Maximum Achievable Control Technology" standards. The final MATS became effective on April 16, 2012, and required that new and existing coal-fueled generating facilities achieve emission standards for mercury, acid gases and other non-mercury hazardous air pollutants. Existing sources were required to comply with the new standards by April 16, 2015, with the potential for individual sources to obtain an extension of up to one additional year, at the discretion of the Title V permitting authority, to complete installation of controls or for transmission system reliability reasons. The relevant Registrants have completed emission reduction projects and unit retirements to comply with the final rule's standards for acid gases and non-mercury metallic hazardous air pollutants. 
 
 On April 25, 2024, the EPA finalized revisions to several aspects of the MATS rule following the agency's review of the 2020 Residual Risk and Technology Review. The EPA made two specific standard changes; one applicable to all covered units and one specific to the existing lignite subcategory. The relevant Registrants are not affected by the changes to the lignite subcategory. The EPA set a more stringent standard for emissions of filterable particulate matter, the surrogate standard for non-mercury metals for coal-fueled electric generating units, and required continuous emissions monitoring for filterable particulate matter to demonstrate compliance with the revised standard. Compliance is due no later than three years after the effective date of the final rule, with limited opportunities for a one-year extension. The relevant Registrants have determined that compliance can be achieved with existing controls, except for PacifiCorp's 10 stake in two units at the Colstrip generating facility, which will require either expensive equipment upgrades or retirement by July 2027. Several states and industry groups have challenged the MATS rule; motions to stay were denied by the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. Until litigation is exhausted, PacifiCorp cannot determine the full impacts of the final rule for the Colstrip units.

Water Quality Standards 
 
 In November 2015, the EPA published final effluent limitation guidelines and standards for the steam electric power generating sector which, among other things, regulate the discharge of bottom ash transport water, fly ash transport water, combustion residual leachate and non-chemical metal cleaning wastes. In November 2019, the EPA proposed updates to the 2015 rule, specifically addressing flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water. The rule took effect in December 2020. The final rule changes the technology-basis for treatment of flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water, revises the voluntary incentives program for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, and adds subcategories for high-flow units, low utilization units, and those that will transition away from coal combustion by 2028. While most of the issues raised by this rule are already being addressed through the CCR rule and are not expected to impose significant additional requirements, the Dave Johnston generating facility is impacted by the rule's bottom ash handling requirements at Units 1 and 2. The generating facility submitted notice to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality that it will either achieve a cessation of coal combustion at Units 1 and 2 by December 31, 2028, or install bottom ash transport treatment technology by December 31, 2025. On April 25, 2024, the EPA finalized additional changes to the effluent limitations guidelines to replace the 2020 rule and provide stricter limits for bottom ash transport water, flue gas desulfurization wastewater and coal combustion residual leachate. The relevant Registrants use a combination of zero discharge, enrollment in cessation-of-coal subcategory and dry bottom ash handling to manage the affected wastestreams. As a result, significant impacts are not anticipated. 
 
 Coal Ash Disposal 
 
 In April 2015, the EPA released a final rule to regulate the management and disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) under the RCRA. The rule regulates coal combustion residuals as non-hazardous waste under RCRA Subtitle D and establishes minimum nationwide standards for the disposal of CCR. Under the final rule, surface impoundments and landfills utilized for coal combustion residuals will need to be closed unless they can meet the more stringent regulatory requirements. 
 
 At the time the rule was published in April 2015, PacifiCorp operated 18 surface impoundments and seven landfills that contained coal combustion residuals. Prior to the effective date of the rule in October 2015, nine surface impoundments and three landfills were either closed or repurposed to no longer receive coal combustion residuals and hence are not subject to the final rule. As PacifiCorp proceeded to implement the final coal combustion rule, it was determined that two surface impoundments located at the Dave Johnston generating facility were hydraulically connected and effectively constitute a single impoundment. In November 2017, a new surface impoundment was placed into service at the Naughton Generating Station. In October 2023, a new surface impoundment was placed into service at the Jim Bridger facility. At the time the rule was published in April 2015, MidAmerican Energy owned or operated nine surface impoundments and four landfills that contained coal combustion residuals. Prior to the effective date of the rule in October 2015, MidAmerican Energy closed or repurposed six surface impoundments to no longer receive coal combustion residuals. As of July 10, 2024, all of the surface impoundments have been closed. At the time the rule was published in April 2015, the Nevada Utilities operated 10 evaporative surface impoundments and two landfills that contained coal combustion residuals. Prior to the effective date of the rule in October 2015, the Nevada Utilities closed four of the surface impoundments, four impoundments discontinued receipt of coal combustion residuals making them inactive and two surface impoundments remain active and subject to the final rule. The two landfills remain active and subject to the final rule. 
 
 57 

Multiple parties filed challenges over various aspects of the final rule in the D.C. Circuit, resulting in settlement of some of the issues and subsequent regulatory action by the EPA. The EPA finalized the first phase of the CCR rule amendments in July 2018 (the "Phase 1, Part 1 rule"). In addition to adopting alternative performance standards and revising groundwater performance standards for certain constituents, the EPA extended the deadline by which facilities must initiate closure of unlined ash ponds exceeding a groundwater protection standard and impoundments that do not meet the rule's aquifer location restrictions to October 31, 2020. On August 14, 2019, the EPA released its "Phase 2" proposal, which contains targeted amendments to the CCR rule in response to court remands and EPA settlement agreements, as well as issues raised in a rulemaking petition. The Phase 2 rule has not been finalized. In February 2020, the EPA proposed a federal CCR permit program as required by the WIIN Act of 2016. The federal permit rule has not been finalized. On April 25, 2024, the EPA finalized the legacy surface impoundments rule to extend federal CCR regulatory requirements to (1) inactive CCR surface impoundments at inactive utilities and (2) CCR management units (CCRMU) at active facilities, including CCR impoundments and landfills that closed prior to the effective date of the 2015 CCR Rule, inactive CCR landfills, and other areas where CCR is managed directly on the land. The final rule includes exemptions and establishes new categories where regulation is deferred for applicable units, including CCRMU containing less than 1,000 tons of CCR, CCRMU located beneath critical infrastructure or large buildings or structures vital to the continuation of current site activities, and CCRMU that were closed prior to the effective date of the new rule. The EPA also finalized one outstanding item from the Part B Proposal in the final legacy CCR rule: the additional closure option for CCR units being closed by removal of CCR such that impacts to groundwater can be remediated after closure of the CCR unit is complete. Affected active facilities must conduct a facility evaluation and report to determine the presence of CCRMUs. The first phase of the facility evaluation is due February 9, 2026, and the second phase is February 8, 2027. Affected inactive facilities must complete an applicability report by November 8, 2024, to determine the presence of legacy surface impoundments. Legacy surface impoundments must initiate groundwater monitoring within 36 months and must initiate closure within 48 months of the rule's publication in the Federal Register. For CCRMUs, groundwater monitoring must be initiated within 48 months and closure must be initiated within 60 months of the rule's publication in the Federal Register. The relevant Registrants do not anticipate identifying any legacy surface impoundments, but do anticipate identifying CCRMUs subject to the rule. Because the facility evaluation and report requirement will determine the magnitude of compliance obligations, the relevant Registrants cannot assess the full impacts of the rule at this time. 
 
 The EPA has previously proposed additional amendments to the CCR rule, including a federal permit program, the "Part B, Part 2" rule, and a beneficial use rulemaking. The Spring 2024 Unified Agenda made available in July 2024 identifies that the EPA plans to finalize the federal permit rule in October 2024. No expected dates were provided for the other two rules. 
 
 Until the outstanding proposals are finalized and fully litigated, the Registrants cannot determine whether additional action may be required. 
 
 Notwithstanding the status of the final CCR rule, citizens' suits have been filed against regulated entities seeking judicial relief for contamination alleged to have been caused by releases of coal combustion residuals. Some of these cases have been successful in imposing liability upon companies if coal combustion residuals contaminate groundwater that is ultimately released or connected to surface water. In addition, actions have been filed against regulated entities seeking to require that surface impoundments containing CCR be subject to closure by removal rather than being allowed to effectuate closure in place as provided under the final rule. The Registrants are not a party to these lawsuits and until they are resolved, the Registrants cannot predict the impact on overall compliance obligations. 
 
 Separately, on June 28, 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision dismissing industry challenges to both the EPA's January 11, 2022, actions and interpretations related to the closure performance standards in the 2015 CCR rule and the EPA's November 28, 2022, final Part A denial for the Gavin Power Station based, in part, on those interpretations. The court ruled that the challenged actions do not amount to the kind of agency action promulgating a regulation or requirement that the court has jurisdiction to review under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. As a result, the court dismissed the petitions for lack of jurisdiction and clarified that EPA's actions were straightforward applications of the rule. The challenged actions concerned the EPA's determinations that (1) operators cannot close surface impoundments with groundwater leaching in and out of the unit; (2) groundwater becomes a "free liquid" as it makes its way into a coal combustion residual unit when assessing the "eliminate free liquids" performance standard; and (3) operators must minimize infiltration of liquids, including groundwater, from all directions to satisfy the infiltration performance standard. The relevant Registrants continue to review the court's decision to assess whether previously closed surface impoundments are impacted.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes and loss contingencies. For additional discussion of the Company's critical accounting estimates, see Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in the Company's assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for updates regarding the wildfire loss contingency estimates.

 Item 1. Financial Statements 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
 PacifiCorp 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PacifiCorp and subsidiaries ("PacifiCorp") as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, and changes in shareholders' equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of PacifiCorp as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 23, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of PacifiCorp's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to PacifiCorp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in PacifiCorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, describes the most significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. There have been no significant changes in PacifiCorp's accounting policies or its assumptions regarding significant accounting estimates during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, other than the updates associated with PacifiCorp's estimates of loss contingencies related to the Oregon and Northern California 2020 wildfires (the "2020 Wildfires"). Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the 2020 Wildfires and the wildfire that began in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California in July 2022 (the "2022 McKinney Fire"), collectively referred to as the "Wildfires."

 Credit Risk 
 
 PacifiCorp is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent PacifiCorp's counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct or indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, PacifiCorp analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, PacifiCorp enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtains third party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, PacifiCorp exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement. 
 
 Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 In accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels ("credit-risk-related contingent features"). These agreements and other agreements that do not refer to specified rating-dependent thresholds may provide the right for counterparties to demand "adequate assurance" if there is a material adverse change in PacifiCorp's creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of September 30, 2024, PacifiCorp's issuer credit ratings for its senior secured debt and its issuer credit ratings for senior unsecured debt from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. 
 
 The aggregate fair value of PacifiCorp's derivative contracts in liability positions with objective credit-risk-related contingent features totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, for which PacifiCorp had posted collateral of million and million, respectively, in the form of cash deposits. If all credit-risk-related contingent features for derivative contracts in liability positions had been triggered as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PacifiCorp would have been required to post million and million, respectively, of additional collateral. PacifiCorp's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation or other factors.

 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. A discounted cash flow valuation method was used to estimate fair value. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which PacifiCorp transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, PacifiCorp uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent PacifiCorp's estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. PacifiCorp bases its forward price curves upon market price quotations, when available, or internally developed and commercial models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations are obtained from independent energy brokers, exchanges, direct communication with market participants and actual transactions executed by PacifiCorp. Market price quotations for certain major electricity and natural gas trading hubs are generally readily obtainable for the first three years; therefore, PacifiCorp's forward price curves for those locations and periods reflect observable market quotes. Market price quotations for other electricity and natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable for the first three years. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, as well as for those contracts that are not actively traded, PacifiCorp uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of these derivative contracts is a function of underlying forward commodity prices, interest rates, currency rates, related volatility, counterparty creditworthiness and duration of contracts. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion regarding PacifiCorp's risk management and hedging activities. 
 
 PacifiCorp's investments in money market mutual funds and investment funds are stated at fair value. When available, PacifiCorp uses a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market to record the fair value. In the absence of a quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security, the fair value is determined using pricing models or net asset values based on observable market inputs and quoted market prices of securities with similar characteristics.

 Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 PacifiCorp is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal, wildfire prevention and mitigation and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. PacifiCorp believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 Lower Klamath Hydroelectric Project 
 
 In November 2022, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") issued a license surrender order for the Lower Klamath Project, which was accepted by the Klamath River Renewal Corporation ("KRRC") and the states of Oregon and California ("States") in December 2022, along with the transfer of the Lower Klamath Project dams. Although PacifiCorp no longer owned the Lower Klamath Project, PacifiCorp continued to operate the facilities under an operation and maintenance agreement with the KRRC until each facility was ready for removal. PacifiCorp's obligations under the operations and maintenance agreement terminated in January 2024. Removal of the Copco No. 2 facility was completed in November 2023, and removal of the remaining dams (J.C. Boyle, Copco No. 1 and Iron Gate) was completed in October 2024. The KRRC has million in funding available for dam removal and restoration; million collected from PacifiCorp's Oregon and California customers and million in California bond funds. PacifiCorp and the States have also agreed to equally share cost overruns that may occur above the initial million in funding. Specifically, PacifiCorp and the States have agreed to equally fund an initial million supplemental fund and equally share any additional costs above that amount to ensure dam removal and restoration is complete. In May 2024, the KRRC communicated to PacifiCorp and the States that it expects to require the million of supplemental funds. 
 
 Legal Matters 
 
 PacifiCorp is party to a variety of legal actions, including litigation, arising out of the normal course of business, some of which assert claims for damages in substantial amounts and are described below. For certain legal actions, parties at times may seek to impose fines, penalties and other costs. 
 
 Pursuant to ASC 450, " Contingencies ," a provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable a liability is likely to occur and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. PacifiCorp evaluates the related range of reasonably estimated losses and records a loss based on its best estimate within that range or the lower end of the range if there is no better estimate. 
 
 75 

billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints and the mass complaints described below that seek billion. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are excluded from this amount. For class actions, amounts specified by the plaintiffs in the complaints include amounts based on estimates of the potential class size, which ultimately may be significantly greater than estimated. Additionally, damages are not limited to the amounts specified in the initially filed complaints as plaintiffs are frequently allowed to amend their complaints to add additional damages and amounts awarded in a court proceeding may be significantly greater than the damages specified. Oregon law provides for doubling of economic and property damages in the event the defendant is found to have acted with gross negligence, recklessness, willfulness or malice. Oregon law provides for trebling of the damages associated with timber, shrubs and produce in the event the defendant is determined to have willfully and intentionally trespassed. 
 
 In California, under inverse condemnation, courts have held that investor-owned utilities can be liable for real and personal property damages from wildfires without the utility being found negligent and regardless of fault. California law also permits inverse condemnation plaintiffs to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs. In both Oregon and California, PacifiCorp has equipment in areas accessed through special use permits, easements or similar agreements that may contain provisions requiring it to pay for damages caused by its equipment regardless of fault. Even if inverse condemnation or other provisions do not apply, PacifiCorp could be found liable for all damages. 
 
 Based on available information to date, PacifiCorp believes it is probable that losses will be incurred associated with the Wildfires. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation or similar processes, the outcome of which, if adverse, could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on PacifiCorp's financial condition. 
 
 2020 Wildfires 
 
 In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to several major wildfires, which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries and loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. The wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp's service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over acres in aggregate. Third-party reports for these wildfires indicate over structures destroyed, including residences; several structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. 
 
 Investigations into the cause and origin of each wildfire are complex and ongoing and have been or are being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. 
 
 76 

named plaintiffs began in Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon. In June 2023, the jury issued its verdict finding PacifiCorp liable to the named plaintiffs and to the class with respect to the wildfires. The jury found PacifiCorp's conduct grossly negligent, reckless and willful as to each plaintiff and the entire class. The jury awarded the named plaintiffs million of damages, including million of economic damages, million of noneconomic damages and million of punitive damages based on a multiplier of the economic and noneconomic damages. 
 
 In September 2023, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon ordered trial dates for damages phase trials described below wherein plaintiffs in each of the damages phase trials would present evidence regarding their damages. 
 
 In January 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon entered a limited judgment and money award for the June 2023 James verdict. The limited judgment awards million of damages based on the amounts awarded by the jury, as well as doubling of the economic damages and offsetting of any insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. Under Oregon Revised Statutes 82.010, interest at a rate of per annum will accrue on the judgment commencing at the date the judgment was entered until the entire money award is paid, amended or reversed by an appellate court. In January 2024, PacifiCorp filed a notice of appeal associated with the June 2023 verdict in James , including whether the case can proceed as a class action and filed a motion to stay further damages phase trials. On February 14, 2024, the Oregon Court of Appeals denied PacifiCorp's request to stay the damages phase trials. On February 13, 2024, the named plaintiffs filed a notice of cross-appeal as to the January 2024 limited judgment and money award. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. 
 
 In January 2024, the jury for the first James damages phase trial awarded plaintiffs million of damages, including million of economic damages and million of noneconomic damages. After the jury verdict, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon doubled the economic damages to million and added million of punitive damages using the multiplier determined by the jury for the June 2023 James verdict, bringing the total damages awarded to million. PacifiCorp requested that the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon judge offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the plaintiffs, and on March 25, 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon granted in large part the offset request. In April 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon entered a limited judgment and money award for the January 2024 James verdict. The limited judgment awards million of damages based on the amounts awarded by the jury and offsetting insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. In April 2024, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. PacifiCorp amended its January 2024 appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the January 2024 jury verdict. 
 
 In March 2024, the jury for the second James damages phase trial awarded plaintiffs million of damages, including million of doubled economic damages, million of noneconomic damages and million of punitive damages using the multiplier determined by the jury for the June 2023 James verdict. PacifiCorp requested that the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon judge offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the plaintiffs and on May 6, 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon granted the offset request. In June 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon entered a limited judgment and money award for the March 2024 James verdict. The limited judgment awards million of damages based on the amounts awarded by the jury and offsetting insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. In July 2024, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. PacifiCorp further amended its appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the March 2024 jury verdict. 
 
 77 

commercial timber plaintiffs in the James consolidated cases, and the jury trial scheduled for April 2024 was cancelled. 
 
 In April, May, July and September 2024, separate mass complaints against PacifiCorp naming individual class members were filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon referencing James as the lead case. These James mass complaints make damages only allegations seeking economic, noneconomic and punitive damages, as well as doubling of economic damages. PacifiCorp believes the magnitude of damages sought by the class members in the James mass complaints to be of remote likelihood of being awarded based on the amounts awarded in the jury verdicts described above that are being appealed. 
 
 In October 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon issued a case management order, which sets forth additional damages phase trials with plaintiffs per trial. The trials are scheduled to begin February 3, March 24, April 21, May 12, June 2, July 7, September 9, October 6 and December 7, 2025. 
 
 2022 McKinney Fire 
 
 According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, a wildfire began on July 29, 2022, in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California located in PacifiCorp's service territory, burning over 60,000 acres. Third-party reports indicate that the 2022 McKinney Fire resulted in 11 structures damaged; 185 structures destroyed, including residences; 12 injuries; and four fatalities. The cause of the 2022 McKinney Fire is undetermined and remains under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. 
 
 Estimated Losses for and Settlements Associated with the Wildfires 
 
 Based on the facts and circumstances available to PacifiCorp as of the date of this filing, including (i) ongoing cause and origin investigations; (ii) ongoing settlement and mediation discussions; (iii) other litigation matters and upcoming legal proceedings; and (iv) the status of the James case, PacifiCorp recorded cumulative estimated probable losses associated with the Wildfires of million through September 30, 2024. PacifiCorp's cumulative accrual includes estimates of probable losses for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that it is reasonably able to estimate at this time and which is subject to change as additional relevant information becomes available.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of PacifiCorp during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with PacifiCorp's historical unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10 Q. PacifiCorp's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations for the Third Quarter and First Nine Months of 2024 and 2023 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 324 million, an increase of 976 million compared to 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to lower estimated losses of 1,263 million associated with the Wildfires, net of expected insurance recoveries, higher utility margin and higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction, partially offset by lower income tax benefit, higher operations and maintenance expense and higher net interest expense. Utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail revenue from higher prices and volumes, lower coal fueled generation costs and higher net wheeling revenue, partially offset by lower net power cost deferrals, higher purchased electricity costs, higher natural gas fueled generation costs and lower wholesale revenue. Retail customer volumes increased 3.2 , primarily due to an increase in customer usage and an increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by unfavorable impacts of weather. Energy generated volumes decreased 10 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower coal fueled generation, partially offset by higher natural gas fueled generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes decreased 26 and energy purchased volumes increased 37 . 
 
 Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was 376 million, an increase of 1,042 million compared to 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to 1,420 million of lower estimated losses associated with the Wildfires, net of expected insurance recoveries, higher utility margin and higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction, partially offset lower income tax benefit, higher operations and maintenance expense and higher net interest expense. Utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail revenue from higher prices and volumes, lower coal fueled generation costs, lower natural gas fueled generation costs and higher net wheeling revenue, partially offset by lower net power cost deferrals, higher purchased electricity costs and lower wholesale revenue. Retail customer volumes increased 3.2 , primarily due to an increase in commercial, industrial and irrigation customer usage and an increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by unfavorable impacts of weather. Energy generated volumes decreased 6 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower coal-fueled and hydro-powered generation, partially offset by higher natural gas-fueled and wind-powered generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes decreased 27 and energy purchased volumes increased 21 . 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 
 Management utilizes various key financial measures that are prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures such as utility margin, to help evaluate results of operations. Utility margin is calculated as operating revenue less cost of fuel and energy, which are captions presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 PacifiCorp's cost of fuel and energy is generally recovered from its customers through regulatory recovery mechanisms and as a result, changes in PacifiCorp's revenue are comparable to changes in such expenses. As such, management believes utility margin more appropriately and concisely explains profitability rather than a discussion of revenue and cost of fuel and energy separately. Management believes the presentation of utility margin provides meaningful and valuable insight into the information management considers important to running the business and a measure of comparability to others in the industry. 
 81 

Utility margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income which is the most comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of utility margin to operating income (in millions):

 83 

Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Utility margin increased 49 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to: 
 248 million increase in retail revenue due to higher average prices and higher volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 3.2 , primarily due to favorable residential customer usage, mainly in Utah and Oregon, favorable Wyoming, Washington and Idaho industrial customer usage, favorable commercial customer usage across the service territory, except in Wyoming, and favorable irrigation customer usage across the service territory, partially offset by unfavorable weather related impacts across the service territory, except in Washington and Wyoming and unfavorable Utah, Oregon and California industrial customer usage; 
 53 million of lower coal-fueled generation costs from lower volumes, partially offset by higher prices; and 
 8 million of higher net wheeling revenue. 
 The increases above were partially offset by: 
 162 million of lower net power costs deferrals in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms; 
 68 million of higher purchased electricity costs from higher volumes, partially offset by lower average market prices; 
 19 million of higher natural gas-fueled generation costs from higher volumes, partially offset by lower prices; and 
 6 million decrease in wholesale revenue primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher average market prices. 
 Operations and maintenance increased 66 million, or 19 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to: 
 24 million of higher insurance expense due to higher premiums associated with third-party liability coverage; 
 15 million of higher vegetation management and wildfire mitigation costs, primarily due to amortization of amounts previously deferred in Oregon (largely offset in retail revenue); 
 11 million of higher demand-side management amortization expense; 
 11 million increase in salary and benefit expenses; 
 3 million increase in legal fees; and 
 3 million increase due to costs associated with the Lower Klamath Project. 
 Wildfire losses, net of recoveries decreased 1,263 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 due to a decrease in estimated losses associated with the Wildfires, net of expected insurance recoveries, in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 2 million, or 1 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher plant-in-service balances in the current year, partially offset by cessation of Washington incremental depreciation of certain coal plants. 
 
 Interest expense increased 53 million, or 38 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher average long-term debt balances due to the issuance of 3.8 billion of First Mortgage Bonds in January 2024. 
 
 Allowance for borrowed and equity funds increased 30 million, or 51 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher qualified construction work-in-progress balances. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased 19 million, or 68 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher regulatory asset interest income of 10 million primarily from higher deferred net power cost balances and higher investment income of 6 million from higher cash equivalents. 
 
 Income tax benefit decreased 265 million, or 77 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 and the effective tax rate was (33) for 2024 and 35 for 2023. The 265 million decrease is primarily due to higher prior year loss accruals, net of expected recoveries, associated with the Wildfires, partially offset by higher recognized PTCs from PacifiCorp's wind-powered generating facilities. 
 
 84 

First Nine Months of 2024 compared to First Nine Months of 2023 
 
 Utility margin increased 137 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to: 
 516 million increase in retail revenue due to higher average prices and higher retail volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 3.2 , primarily due to favorable Utah, Oregon and Washington commercial customer usage and Utah residential customer usage, favorable industrial customer usage across the eastern service territory and Washington, and favorable irrigation customer usage across the service territory, favorable changes in the average number of residential and commercial customers across the service territory, mainly in Utah and Oregon, partially offset by unfavorable weather impacts across the service territory, except Wyoming, and unfavorable residential customer usage across the western service territory, mainly in Oregon; 
 51 million of lower coal-fueled generation costs due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher prices; 
 31 million of lower natural gas-fueled generation costs from lower prices, partially offset by higher volumes; and 
 23 million of higher net wheeling revenue. 
 The increases above were partially offset by: 
 246 million of lower net power costs deferrals in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms; 
 175 million of higher purchased electricity costs from higher volumes, partially offset by lower average market prices; and 
 60 million decrease in wholesale revenue primarily due to lower volumes and lower average market prices. 
 Operations and maintenance increased 192 million, or 18 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to: 
 63 million of higher insurance expense due to higher premiums associated with third-party liability coverage;

 85 

Income tax benefit decreased 311 million, or 64 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 and the effective tax rate was (86) for 2024 and 42 for 2023. The 311 million decrease is primarily due to higher prior year loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, associated with the Wildfires and the release of a valuation allowance on state net operating loss carryforwards in 2023, partially offset by higher recognized PTCs from PacifiCorp's wind-powered generating facilities. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, PacifiCorp's total net liquidity was as follows (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents 381 Credit facilities (1)

 (1) Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and "Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit" below for further discussion regarding PacifiCorp's credit facilities. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 671 million and 1,067 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to higher wildfire liability settlement payments, higher wholesale purchases and lower wholesale sales, higher operating expense payments, lower net transmission and security deposits received and higher cash paid for interest, partially offset by higher collections from retail customers and insurance reimbursements related to wildfire liabilities. 
 
 The timing of PacifiCorp's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (2,150) million and (2,245) million, respectively. The change is primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of 93 million. Refer to "Future Uses of Cash" for discussion of capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 1.7 billion. Sources of cash consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of 3.8 billion in January 2024. Uses of cash consisted primarily of 1.6 billion for the repayment of short-term debt and 425 million for the repayment of long-term debt. 
 
 For a discussion of recent financing transactions, refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 were 649 million. Sources of cash consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of 1.2 billion in January 2023 and from the borrowing of short term debt of 165 million. Uses of cash consisted primarily of 401 million for the repayment of long term debt and 300 million for common stock dividends paid to PPW Holdings LLC. 
 
 86 

Short-term Debt 
 
 Regulatory authorities limit PacifiCorp to 3.0 billion of short-term debt. As of September 30, 2024, PacifiCorp had no short term debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, PacifiCorp had 1.6 billion of short-term debt outstanding at a weighted average rate of 6.16 . 
 
 Debt Authorizations 
 
 In March and April 2024, PacifiCorp applied for additional short-term debt issuance authority from the FERC, the OPUC and the IPUC, and in May 2024, all three commissions issued final orders approving the additional issuance authority from 2.0 billion to up to 3.0 billion in total authorized short-term debt outstanding at any one time. 
 
 In March 2024, PacifiCorp applied for additional long-term debt issuance authority from the OPUC and the IPUC. In April and July 2024, respectively, the IPUC and the OPUC issued final orders approving PacifiCorp to issue an additional 5.0 billion of long-term debt. PacifiCorp also must make a notice filing with the WUTC prior to any future long-term debt issuance. PacifiCorp currently has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC to issue an indeterminate amount of first mortgage bonds and unsecured debt securities through July 2027. 
 
 Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit 
 
 In June 2024, PacifiCorp terminated its existing 900 million unsecured delayed draw term loan facility expiring in June 2025 and entered into a new 900 million 364-day unsecured credit facility expiring in June 2025. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, PacifiCorp had no letters of credit outstanding under its 2.0 billion revolving credit facility and had an additional 34 million of letters of credit outstanding in support of certain transactions required by third parties. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 PacifiCorp has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the issuance of commercial paper, the use of unsecured revolving credit facilities, bank loans, capital contributions and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which PacifiCorp has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including PacifiCorp's credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk associated with PacifiCorp and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 PacifiCorp has significant future capital requirements. Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, impacts to customer rates; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; outcomes of regulatory proceedings, including regulatory filings for Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity; outcomes of legal actions associated with the Wildfires; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; new customer requests; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. 
 
 87 

PacifiCorp's historical and forecast capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, are as follows (in millions): 
 Nine-Month Periods Annual Ended September 30, Forecast 2023 2024 2024 Wind generation 550 268 478 Electric distribution 472 567 757 Electric transmission 743 612 865 Wildfire mitigation 197 264 479 Other 288 446 473 Total 2,250 2,157 3,052 
 PacifiCorp's IRP is a roadmap for PacifiCorp's energy transition to renewable and carbon free generation resources, coal-to-natural gas conversion of certain coal-fueled units, energy storage, associated transmission, load forecast and resource adequacy. PacifiCorp anticipates that the additional new renewable and carbon free generation and energy storage will be a mixture of owned and contracted resources. PacifiCorp has included estimates for these new renewable and carbon free generation and energy storage resources, conversion of certain coal-fueled units to natural gas-fueled units, energy storage assets and associated transmission assets in its forecast capital expenditures. These estimates are likely to change as a result of the IRP update and RFP process. PacifiCorp's historical and forecast capital expenditures include the following: 
 Wind generation includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Growth projects include construction of new wind-powered generating facilities and construction at existing wind-powered generating facility sites acquired from third parties totaling 249 million and 540 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Planned spending for the construction of additional wind powered generating facilities and those at acquired sites totals 202 million for the remainder of 2024 and is primarily for the Rock River I, Rock Creek I and Rock Creek II wind powered generating facilities totaling approximately 640 MWs that are expected to be placed in service in 2024 and 2025. 
 Electric distribution includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include spending on new customer connections totaling 253 million and 184 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Planned spending for new customer connections totals 68 million for the remainder of 2024. The remaining investments primarily relate to expenditures for distribution operations. 
 Electric transmission includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Transmission growth investments primarily reflect costs associated with major transmission projects totaling 376 million and 486 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Planned spending for major transmission segments that are expected to be placed in service in 2024 through 2031 totals 122 million for the remainder of 2024. 
 Wildfire mitigation includes operating expenditures for wildfire mitigation activities totaling 264 million and 197 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Planned spending for wildfire mitigation totals 215 million for the remainder of 2024. 
 Other includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Expenditures for information technology totaled 125 million and 128 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Planned information technology spending totals 36 million for the remainder of 2024. The remaining investments relate to operating projects that consist of routine expenditures for generation and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 
 Energy Supply Planning 
 
 As required by certain state regulations, PacifiCorp uses an IRP to develop a long-term resource plan to ensure that PacifiCorp can continue to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to its customers while maintaining compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws and regulations. PacifiCorp files its IRP biennially with the state commissions in each of the six states where PacifiCorp operates. Five states indicate whether the IRP meets the state commission's IRP standards and guidelines, a process referred to as "acknowledgment" in some states. Acknowledgment by a state commission does not address cost recovery or prudency of resources ultimately selected. 
 
 88 

In April 2024, PacifiCorp filed its 2023 IRP Update in Utah, Oregon, Wyoming and Idaho. In Washington, this filing was submitted as informational. Concurrent with the filing of the 2023 IRP Update, PacifiCorp filed an Oregon Planning Supplement to address additional requirements related to the Oregon Clean Energy Plan. 
 
 Requests for Proposals 
 
 PacifiCorp issues individual RFPs to procure resources identified in the IRP or resources driven by customer demands and regulatory policy changes. The IRP and the RFPs provide for the identification and staged procurement of resources to meet load or state-specific compliance obligations. Depending upon the specific RFP, applicable laws and regulations may require PacifiCorp to file draft RFPs with the UPSC, the OPUC and the WUTC. Approval by the UPSC, the OPUC or the WUTC may be required depending on the nature of the RFPs. 
 
 PacifiCorp's most recent RFP, the 2022 All-Source ("2022AS") RFP, was issued to the market in April 2022. In September 2023, PacifiCorp suspended its 2022AS RFP and in April 2024, PacifiCorp provided notice that the 2022AS RFP was terminated. As indicated in the 2022AS RFP, PacifiCorp reserves the right, without limitation or qualification and in its sole discretion, to reject any or all bids, and to terminate or suspend the RFP in whole or in part at any time. 
 
 Key drivers behind PacifiCorp's decision to terminate the 2022AS RFP included:

 The preferred portfolio in the 2023 IRP Update demonstrates that with limited procurement of battery resources in the near term, which can be achieved outside of an RFP process, there is material benefit to customers to scaling down and delaying resource acquisition until after 2030. PacifiCorp's 2025 IRP, which is expected to be issued in early 2025, will inform the next steps for incremental resource acquisition. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in cash requirements from the information provided in Item 7 of PacifiCorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than those disclosed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 PacifiCorp is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for discussion regarding PacifiCorp's current regulatory matters. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 PacifiCorp is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact PacifiCorp's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. PacifiCorp believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and PacifiCorp is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding environmental laws and regulations.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes and wildfire loss contingencies. For additional discussion of PacifiCorp's critical accounting estimates, see Item 7 of PacifiCorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in PacifiCorp's assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for updates regarding the wildfire loss contingency estimates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of 
 MidAmerican Energy Company 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying balance sheet of MidAmerican Energy Company ("MidAmerican Energy") as of September 30, 2024, the related statements of operations, and changes in shareholder's equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the balance sheet of MidAmerican Energy as of December 31, 2023, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholder's equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 23, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of MidAmerican Energy's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to MidAmerican Energy in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Credit Facilities

 Income tax credits relate primarily to production tax credits ("PTC") earned by MidAmerican Energy's wind- and solar-powered generating facilities. Federal renewable electricity PTCs are earned as energy from qualifying wind- and solar-powered generating facilities is produced and sold and are based on a per-kilowatt hour rate pursuant to the applicable federal income tax law. MidAmerican Energy recognizes its renewable electricity PTCs throughout the year based on when the credits are earned and excludes them from the annual effective tax rate that is the basis for the interim recognition of the remaining income tax expense. Wind- and solar-powered generating facilities are eligible for the credits for years from the date the qualifying generating facilities are placed in-service. PTCs recognized for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, totaled million and million, respectively. 
 
 Berkshire Hathaway includes BHE and subsidiaries in its U.S. federal and Iowa state income tax returns. Consistent with established regulatory practice, MidAmerican Energy's provision for income tax has been computed on a stand-alone basis, and substantially all of its currently payable or receivable income tax is remitted to or received from BHE. MidAmerican Energy received net cash payments for income tax from BHE totaling million and million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 MidAmerican Energy's investments in money market mutual funds and debt and equity securities are stated at fair value, with debt securities accounted for as available-for-sale securities. When available, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used to record the fair value. In the absence of a quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security, the fair value is determined using pricing models or net asset values based on observable market inputs and quoted market prices of securities with similar characteristics. ) ) Changes in fair value recognized in net regulatory assets ) ) ) ) Settlements Ending balance ) ) ) ) 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's long-term debt is carried at cost on the Balance Sheets. The fair value of MidAmerican Energy's long-term debt is a Level 2 fair value measurement and has been estimated based upon quoted market prices, where available, or at the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates consistent with comparable maturities with similar credit risks. The carrying value of MidAmerican Energy's variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair value because of the frequent repricing of these instruments at market rates.

 Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. MidAmerican Energy believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 Legal Matters 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is party to a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. MidAmerican Energy does not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material impact on its financial results. 
 
 Transmission Rates 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's wholesale transmission rates are set annually using formula rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") subject to true-up for actual cost of service. In November 2013 and February 2015, a coalition of intervenors filed successive complaints with the FERC requesting that the base return on equity ("ROE") used to determine rates in effect prior to September 2016 no longer be found just and reasonable and sought to reduce the base ROE. In August 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion vacating all orders related to the complaints and remanding them back to the FERC. In October 2024, the FERC issued an order addressing the remand. The order sets a just and reasonable ROE for the first complaint period and for the period from September 28, 2016, forward. The order continued to find that no refunds are required for the second complaint period. MidAmerican Energy has evaluated the impact of the order and has determined it will not have a material impact on its financial results.

Pricing for regulated electric and natural gas sales are established separately by regulatory agencies; therefore, management also reviews each segment separately to make decisions regarding allocation of resources and evaluating performance.

Information in Management's Discussion and Analysis related to MidAmerican Energy, whether or not segregated, also relates to MidAmerican Funding. Information related to other subsidiaries of MidAmerican Funding pertains only to the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of MidAmerican Funding. Where necessary, discussions have been segregated under the heading "MidAmerican Funding" to allow the reader to identify information applicable only to MidAmerican Funding. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with MidAmerican Funding's historical unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and MidAmerican Energy's historical unaudited Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. MidAmerican Funding's and MidAmerican Energy's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations for the Third Quarter and First Nine Months of 2024 and 2023 
 
 Overview 
 
 MidAmerican Energy - 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 340 million, an increase of 16 million, compared to 2023, primarily due to a favorable income tax benefit, favorable changes in the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, higher natural gas utility margin, higher AFUDC and higher interest and dividend income, partially offset by lower electric utility margin, higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher interest expense and higher operations and maintenance expense. Utility margin decreased primarily due to lower recoveries through bill riders and the unfavorable impact of weather, partially offset by higher electric retail customer usage, higher wholesale margin and higher natural gas base rates. Electric retail customer volumes increased 0.5 , primarily due to higher customer usage for certain industrial and other customers, partially offset by lower customer usage for certain residential and commercial customers and the unfavorable impact of weather. Energy generated decreased 6 due to lower coal-fueled generation, partially offset by higher renewable-powered and natural gas-fueled generation; and energy purchased volumes decreased 19 . Wholesale electricity sales volumes decreased 28 due to unfavorable market conditions. Natural gas retail customer volumes decreased 5 due to lower sales to industrial customers. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's net income for the first nine months of 2024 was 815 million, an increase of 13 million, compared to 2023, primarily due to a favorable income tax benefit, higher natural gas utility margin, higher AFUDC, higher interest and dividend income and favorable changes in the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, partially offset by higher interest expense, higher operations and maintenance expense, lower electric utility margin, higher depreciation and amortization expense and higher property and other taxes. Utility margin decreased primarily due to lower wholesale margin, lower recoveries through bill riders and the unfavorable impact of weather, partially offset by higher natural gas base rates and higher electric retail customer usage. Electric retail customer volumes increased 0.6 , primarily due to higher customer usage for certain industrial and other customers, partially offset by lower customer usage for certain residential and commercial customers and the unfavorable impact of weather. Energy generated decreased 2 due to lower coal-fueled generation, partially offset by higher renewable-powered and natural gas-fueled generation; and energy purchased volumes decreased 18 . Wholesale electricity sales volumes decreased 11 due to unfavorable market conditions. Natural gas retail customer volumes decreased 10 due to the unfavorable impact of weather. 
 
 MidAmerican Funding - 
 
 MidAmerican Funding's net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 337 million, an increase of 16 million, compared to 2023. MidAmerican Funding's net income for the first nine months of 2024 was 806 million, an increase of 3 million, compared to 2023. The variance in net income was primarily due to the changes in MidAmerican Energy's earnings discussed above, partially offset by a one-time gain on the sale of an investment of 10 million in 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 
 Management utilizes various key financial measures that are prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures such as, electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin, to help evaluate results of operations. Electric utility margin is calculated as regulated electric operating revenue less cost of fuel and energy, which are captions presented on the Statements of Operations. Natural gas utility margin is calculated as regulated natural gas operating revenue less regulated cost of natural gas purchased for resale, which are included in regulated natural gas and other and cost of natural gas purchased for resale and other, respectively, on the Statements of Operations. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's cost of fuel and energy and cost of natural gas purchased for resale are generally recovered from its retail customers through regulatory recovery mechanisms, and as a result, changes in MidAmerican Energy's expense included in regulatory recovery mechanisms result in comparable changes to revenue. As such, management believes electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin more appropriately and concisely explain profitability rather than a discussion of revenue and cost of sales separately. Management believes the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin provides meaningful and valuable insight into the information management considers important to running the business and a measure of comparability to others in the industry. 
 
 Electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, which is the most comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of utility margin to MidAmerican Energy's operating income (in millions):

These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. MidAmerican Energy believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and MidAmerican Energy is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, impairment of goodwill, pension and other postretirement benefits and income taxes. For additional discussion of MidAmerican Energy's and MidAmerican Funding's critical accounting estimates, see Item 7 of their Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in MidAmerican Energy's and MidAmerican Funding's assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.

PART I 
 Item 1. Financial Statements 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of 
 Nevada Power Company 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Nevada Power Company and subsidiaries ("Nevada Power") as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, and changes in shareholder's equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of Nevada Power as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholder's equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 23, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of Nevada Power's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Nevada Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Effects of ratemaking is primarily attributable to the recognition of excess deferred income taxes related to 2017 tax reform pursuant to an order issued by the PUCN effective January 1, 2021. 
 
 Income tax credits relate to production tax credits ("PTCs") and investment tax credits ("ITCs") from Nevada Power's solar-powered generating facilities and energy storage properties. Federal renewable electricity PTCs are earned as energy from qualifying solar-powered generating facilities is produced and sold and are based on a per-kilowatt hour rate pursuant to the applicable federal income tax law. Solar-powered generating facilities are eligible for the credits for years from the date the qualifying generating facilities are placed in-service. Federal renewable electricity ITCs are tax credits that reduce the income tax liability by a percentage of the cost from certain qualifying solar-powered generating facilities or energy storage properties over their useful lives. The percentage of the credit varies depending on attributes of the project up to a maximum of percent. PTCs recognized for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled million and million, respectively. ITCs recognized for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled million and , respectively. 
 
 Berkshire Hathaway includes BHE and its subsidiaries in its U.S. federal income tax return. Consistent with established regulatory practice, Nevada Power's provision for federal income tax has been computed on a stand-alone basis, and substantially all of its currently payable or receivable income tax is remitted to or received from BHE. Nevada Power made cash payments for federal income tax to BHE of million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Nevada Power received cash payments for federal income tax from BHE of million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which Nevada Power transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, Nevada Power uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent Nevada Power's estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. Nevada Power bases its forward price curves upon internally developed models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations for certain electricity and natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable due to markets that are not active. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, Nevada Power uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The model incorporates a mid-market pricing convention (the mid point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The determination of the fair value for derivative contracts not only includes counterparty risk, but also the impact of Nevada Power's nonperformance risk on its liabilities, which as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, had an immaterial impact to the fair value of its derivative contracts. As such, Nevada Power considers its derivative contracts to be valued using Level 3 inputs.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Nevada Power during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Nevada Power's historical unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Nevada Power's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations for the Third Quarter and First Nine Months of 2024 and 2023 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 211 million which is consistent when compared to 2023 primarily due to higher utility margin and lower depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by higher income tax expense, lower interest and dividend income, lower capitalized interest and allowance for equity funds, higher operations and maintenance expense and higher interest expense. Utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail customer volumes, higher retail rates from the 2023 regulatory rate review with new rates effective January 2024 and higher power purchase agreement sales, partially offset by lower regulatory-related revenue deferrals. Operations and maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher plant operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by the impact of regulatory amortizations approved in the 2023 regulatory rate review. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 8.8 primarily due to the favorable impact of weather, favorable changes in customer usage patterns and an increase in the average number of customers. Energy generated volumes increased 21 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher natural-gas fueled generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes increased 103 and energy purchased volumes decreased 2 . 
 
 Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was 323 million, an increase of 42 million, compared to 2023 primarily due to higher utility margin, lower depreciation and amortization expense and higher capitalized interest and allowance for equity funds, partially offset by lower interest and dividend income, higher income tax expense and higher interest expense. Utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail customer volumes, higher retail rates from the 2023 regulatory rate review with new rates effective January 2024 and higher power purchase agreement sales, partially offset by lower regulatory-related revenue deferrals. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 7.8 primarily due to the favorable impact of weather, favorable changes in customer usage patterns and an increase in the average number of customers. Energy generated volumes increased 16 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher natural-gas fueled generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes increased 122 and energy purchased volumes decreased 1 . 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 
 Management utilizes various key financial measures that are prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures such as, utility margin, to help evaluate results of operations. Utility margin is calculated as electric operating revenue less cost of fuel and energy, which are captions presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Nevada Power's cost of fuel and energy are directly recovered from its customers through regulatory recovery mechanisms and as a result, changes in Nevada Power's expenses result in comparable changes to revenue. As such, management believes utility margin more appropriately and concisely explains profitability rather than a discussion of revenue and cost of sales separately. Management believes the presentation of utility margin provides meaningful and valuable insight into the information management considers important to running the business and a measure of comparability to others in the industry. 
 
 141 

Utility margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of utility margin to operating income (in millions):

Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Utility margin increased 23 million, or 5 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to: 
 34 million of higher electric retail utility margin primarily due to higher retail customer volumes and the 2023 regulatory rate review with new rates effective January 2024. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 8.8 primarily due to favorable changes in weather and customer usage patterns and an increase in the average number of customers, 
 5 million of higher power purchase agreement sales, 
 3 million of higher energy efficiency program revenue (offset in operations and maintenance expense) and 
 2 million of higher transmission and wholesale revenue. 
 The increase in utility margin was partially offset by: 
 12 million of lower regulatory-related revenue deferrals, 
 8 million of lower other retail revenue from the impact of regulatory amortizations approved in the 2023 regulatory rate review and 
 4 million of lower other revenue from expiring regulatory amortizations. 
 
 Operations and maintenance increased 5 million, or 6 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher plant operations and maintenance costs, higher energy efficiency program costs (offset in revenue), higher general and administrative costs, higher technology costs and higher insurance premiums due to additional wildfire and general excess liability coverage, partially offset by the impact of regulatory amortizations approved in the 2023 regulatory rate review. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 14 million, or 13 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower regulatory amortizations, partially offset by higher amortization from an increased rate for intangible software approved in the 2023 regulatory rate review. 
 
 Interest expense increased 2 million, or 4 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher long-term debt and higher average interest rate. 
 
 Capitalized interest and allowance for equity funds decreased 6 million, or 46 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower construction work-in-progress. 
 
 Interest and dividend income decreased 13 million, or 72 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to unfavorable interest income, mainly from lower carrying charges on regulatory balances. 
 
 Other, net was favorable by 4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower pension expense. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 14 million, or 67 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the effects of ratemaking partially offset by higher federal income tax credits. The effective tax rate was 14 in 2024 and 9 in 2023 and increased primarily due to the effects of ratemaking, offset by higher federal tax credits. 

First Nine Months of 2024 Compared to First Nine Months of 2023 
 Utility margin increased 59 million, or 6 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to: 
 84 million of higher electric retail utility margin primarily due to higher retail customer volumes and the 2023 regulatory rate review with new rates effective January 2024. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 7.8 primarily due to favorable changes in weather and customer usage patterns and an increase in the average number of customers, 
 9 million of higher power purchase agreement sales, 
 5 million of higher energy efficiency program revenue (offset in operations and maintenance expense), 
 4 million of higher energy efficiency implementation revenue and 
 4 million of higher transmission and wholesale revenue. 
 144 

The increase in utility margin was offset by: 
 26 million of lower regulatory-related revenue deferrals, 
 11 million of lower other retail revenue from the impact of regulatory amortizations approved in the 2023 regulatory rate review and 
 10 million of lower other revenue from expiring regulatory amortizations. 
 
 Operations and maintenance increased by 1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher plant operations and maintenance costs, higher insurance premiums due to additional wildfire and general excess liability coverage, higher energy efficiency program costs (offset in revenue), higher general and administrative costs and higher technology costs, partially offset by the impact of regulatory amortizations approved in the 2023 regulatory rate review.

 Income tax expense increased 23 million, or 79 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the effects of ratemaking and higher pretax income, partially offset by higher federal income tax credits. The effective tax rate was 14 in 2024 and 9 in 2023 and increased primarily due to the effects of ratemaking, offset by higher federal tax credits. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Nevada Power's total net liquidity was as follows (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents 41 Credit facility 600 Total net liquidity 641 Credit facility: Maturity date 2027 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 804 million and 423 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to lower payments related to fuel and energy costs and the timing of payments for operating costs, partially offset by higher income tax payments, lower collections from customers, decreased vendor deposits and higher interest payments. 
 
 The timing of Nevada Power's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 145 

Investing Activities 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were (838) million and (1,002) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to decreased capital expenditures, partially offset by decreased proceeds from repayment of an affiliate note receivable. Refer to "Future Uses of Cash" for further discussion of capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 54 million and 579 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from long-term debt, lower contributions from NV Energy, Inc. and higher dividends paid to NV Energy, Inc., partially offset by a decrease in repayments of long-term debt. 
 
 In October 2024, Nevada Power declared and paid a dividend to NV Energy, Inc. of 45 million. 
 
 Debt Authorizations 
 
 Nevada Power currently has financing authority from the PUCN consisting of the ability to: (1) establish debt issuances limited to a debt ceiling of 3.8 billion (excluding borrowings under Nevada Power's 600 million secured credit facility); and (2) maintain a revolving credit facility of up to 1.3 billion. Nevada Power currently has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC to issue an additional 2.1 billion of general and refunding mortgage securities through November 2025. 
 
 In August 2024, Nevada Power filed an application with the PUCN for authority to increase its debt ceiling from 3.8 billion to 5.5 billion for three years from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2028 (excluding borrowings under Nevada Power's 600 million secured credit facility); and (2) maintain a revolving credit facility of up to 1.3 billion. An order approving the application was received in October 2024. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 Nevada Power has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the use of its secured revolving credit facility, capital contributions and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which Nevada Power has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including regulatory approvals, Nevada Power's credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; impacts to customer rates; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. Prudently incurred expenditures for compliance-related items such as pollution control technologies, replacement generation and associated operating costs are generally incorporated into Nevada Power's regulated retail rates. Expenditures for certain assets may ultimately include acquisition of existing assets. 
 
 146 

Nevada Power's historical and forecast capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items are as follows (in millions): 
 Nine-Month Periods Annual Ended September 30, Forecast 2023 2024 2024 Electric distribution 257 256 395 Electric transmission 110 97 247 Solar generation 257 19 21 Electric battery storage 104 12 17 Other 374 458 551 Total 1,102 842 1,231 
 
 Nevada Power received PUCN approval through its previous IRP filings for an increase in solar generation, electric transmission and peaking turbines at a generating facility. Nevada Power has included estimates from its previous and latest IRP filings in its forecast capital expenditures for 2024. These estimates may change as a result of the RFP process. Nevada Power's historical and forecast capital expenditures include the following: 
 Electric distribution includes both growth projects and operating expenditures consisting of routine expenditures for distribution needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 Electric transmission includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Growth projects primarily relate to the Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program. Operating expenditures consist of routine expenditures for transmission and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 Solar generation includes two growth projects and other planned solar generating facilities. The first growth project consists of a 150-MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 100 MWs of co-located battery storage that was developed in Clark County, Nevada. Commercial operation occurred in May 2024. The second growth project consists of a 400-MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 400-MW of co-located battery storage that would be developed in Churchill County, Nevada with ownership share approved by the PUCN of 10 Nevada Power and 90 Sierra Pacific. Commercial operation of the solar is expected by early 2027. 
 Electric battery storage includes two growth projects and other planned electric battery storage systems. The first project consists of a 100-MW battery energy storage system co-located with a 150-MW solar photovoltaic facility that was developed in Clark County, Nevada. Commercial operation occurred in May 2024. The second growth project consists of a 400-MW battery energy storage system co-located with a 400MW solar photovoltaic facility that would be developed in Churchill County, Nevada with ownership share approved by the PUCN of 10 Nevada Power and 90 Sierra Pacific. Commercial operation of the battery energy storage system is expected by mid 2026. 
 Other includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Growth projects primarily consist of an additional 444 MW of peaking combustion turbines that were approved by the PUCN and are under development at the Silverhawk generating facility in Clark County, Nevada. Commercial operation occurred in July 2024. Operating expenditures consist of turbine upgrades at several generating facilities, routine expenditures for generation, other operating projects and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 
 2024 Joint Integrated Resource Plan 
 
 In May 2024, the Nevada Utilities filed its Joint Application for approval of the 2024 Joint Integrated Resource Plan. The Joint Application seeks, in part (1) the addition of three power purchase agreements for solar generating resources totaling more than 1,000 MW, each with co-located battery storage systems; (2) the addition of 400 MW of company-owned hydrogen-capable natural gas simple cycle combustion turbine peakers at the North Valmy generation station; (3) to approve an update of the Greenlink Nevada transmission project costs; and (4) to construct the necessary transmission infrastructure to support growing customer demand. An order is expected by the end of 2024.

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in cash requirements from the information provided in Item 7 of Nevada Power's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than those disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 Nevada Power is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for discussion regarding Nevada Power's current regulatory matters. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 Nevada Power is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact Nevada Power's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. Nevada Power believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and Nevada Power is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, impairment of long-lived assets and income taxes. For additional discussion of Nevada Power's critical accounting estimates, see Item 7 of Nevada Power's Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in Nevada Power's assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of 
 Sierra Pacific Power Company 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Sierra Pacific Power Company and subsidiaries ("Sierra Pacific") as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, and changes in shareholder's equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of Sierra Pacific as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholder's equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 23, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of Sierra Pacific's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Sierra Pacific in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which Sierra Pacific transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, Sierra Pacific uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent Sierra Pacific's estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. Sierra Pacific bases its forward price curves upon internally developed models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations for certain electricity and natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable due to markets that are not active. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, Sierra Pacific uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The model incorporates a mid-market pricing convention (the mid point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The determination of the fair value for derivative contracts not only includes counterparty risk, but also the impact of Sierra Pacific's nonperformance risk on its liabilities, which as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, had an immaterial impact to the fair value of its derivative contracts. As such, Sierra Pacific considers its derivative contracts to be valued using Level 3 inputs. 
 
 Sierra Pacific's investments in money market mutual funds and investment funds are stated at fair value. When available, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used to record the fair value.

 Sierra Pacific's long-term debt is carried at cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of Sierra Pacific's long-term debt is a Level 2 fair value measurement and has been estimated based upon quoted market prices, where available, or at the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates consistent with comparable maturities with similar credit risks. The carrying value of Sierra Pacific's variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair value because of the frequent repricing of these instruments at market rates.

 Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 Sierra Pacific is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding climate change, renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact Sierra Pacific's current and future operations. Sierra Pacific believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Sierra Pacific during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Sierra Pacific's historical unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Sierra Pacific's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations for the Third Quarter and First Nine Months of 2024 and 2023 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 47 million, a decrease of 17 million, or 27 , compared to 2023 primarily due to increased operations and maintenance expenses, higher interest expense and lower interest and dividend income, partially offset by higher utility margin and lower income tax expense. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to higher customer volumes and favorable price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower transmission and wholesale revenue and lower regulatory-related revenue deferrals. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased by 6.7 primarily due to customer usage patterns, favorable impact of weather and an increase in the average number of customers. Energy generated volumes increased 12 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023. Wholesale electricity sales volumes increased 40 and energy purchased volumes decreased 32 . 
 
 Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was 69 million, a decrease of 42 million, or 38 , compared to 2023 primarily due to increased operations and maintenance expenses, higher interest expense, lower utility margin and lower interest and dividend income, partially offset by lower income tax expense and higher allowances for borrowed and equity funds from increased construction work-in-progress. Electric utility margin decreased primarily due to lower transmission and wholesale revenue and lower regulatory-related revenue deferrals, partially offset by higher retail customer volumes. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased by 3.9 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers. Energy generated volumes increased 10 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Wholesale electricity sales volumes increased 12 and energy purchased volumes decreased 17 . 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 Management utilizes various key financial measures that are prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures such as, electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin, to help evaluate results of operations. Electric utility margin is calculated as electric operating revenue less cost of fuel and energy while natural gas utility margin is calculated as natural gas operating revenue less cost of natural gas purchased for resale, which are captions presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Sierra Pacific's cost of fuel and energy and cost of natural gas purchased for resale are generally recovered from its customers through regulatory recovery mechanisms and as a result, changes in Sierra Pacific's expenses result in comparable changes to revenue. As such, management believes electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin more appropriately and concisely explain profitability rather than a discussion of revenue and cost of sales separately. Management believes the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin provides meaningful and valuable insight into the information management considers important to running the business and a measure of comparability to others in the industry. 
 165 

Electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of utility margin to operating income (in millions):

 Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Electric utility margin increased 3 million , or 2 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to: 
 9 million of higher electric retail utility margin primarily due to higher retail customer volumes and favorable price impacts from changes in sales mix. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 6.7 primarily due to customer usage patterns, favorable impact of weather and an increase in the average number of customers. 
 The increase in electric utility margin was partially offset by: 
 4 million of lower transmission and wholesale revenue and 
 2 million of lower regulatory-related revenue deferrals. 
 
 Operations and maintenance increased 19 million, or 40 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher plant operations and maintenance expenses, higher insurance premiums due to additional wildfire and general excess liability coverage, regulatory impacts from the 2024 general rate review, higher regulatory expenses primarily related to mill tax and higher technology costs, partially offset by lower administrative and general costs. 
 
 Interest expense increased 6 million, or 38 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher long-term debt and higher average interest rate. 
 
 Allowance for borrowed and equity funds increased 3 million, or 60 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher construction work-in-progress. 
 
 Interest and dividend income decreased 4 million, or 67 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to unfavorable interest income, mainly from lower carrying charges on regulatory balances. 
 
 168 

Income tax expense decreased 4 million, or 40 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower pretax income. The effective tax rate was 11 in 2024 and 14 in 2023 and decreased primarily due to the effects of ratemaking. 

First Nine Months of 2024 Compared to First Nine Months of 2023 
 
 Electric utility margin decreased 5 million , or 1 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to: 
 8 million of lower transmission and wholesale revenue and 
 2 million of lower regulatory-related revenue deferrals. 
 The decrease in electric utility margin was partially offset by: 
 5 million of higher electric retail utility margin primarily due to higher retail customer volumes, partially offset by unfavorable price impacts from changes in sales mix. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 3.9 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers . 
 
 Natural gas utility margin decreased 2 million, or 5 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower customer volumes from the unfavorable impact of weather, partially offset by an increase in the average number of customers. 
 
 Operations and maintenance increased 29 million, or 19 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher insurance premiums due to additional wildfire and general excess liability coverage, regulatory impacts from the 2024 general rate review, higher plant operations and maintenance expenses, higher regulatory expenses primarily related to mill tax, higher technology costs and higher administrative and general costs. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 3 million, or 2 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher plant placed in-service.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Sierra Pacific's total net liquidity was as follows (in millions): 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents 16 Credit facility 385 Total net liquidity 401 Credit facility: Maturity date 2027 

169 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 330 million and 306 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to lower payments related to fuel energy costs and increased customer deposits, partially offset by lower collections from customers, the timing of payments for operating costs, higher interest payments and higher income tax payments. 
 
 The timing of Sierra Pacific's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were (432) million and (284) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures. Refer to "Future Uses of Cash" for further discussion of capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 72 million and (32) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to a decrease in repayments of long-term debt, lower repayments of an affiliate note payable and higher contributions from NV Energy, Inc., partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from long-term debt and higher dividends paid to NV Energy, Inc. 
 
 In October 2024, Sierra Pacific received a contribution from NV Energy, Inc. of 45 million. 
 
 For a discussion of recent financing transactions, refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Debt Authorizations 
 
 Sierra Pacific currently has financing authority from the PUCN consisting of the ability to: (1) establish debt issuances limited to a debt ceiling of 1.9 billion (excluding borrowings under Sierra Pacific's 400 million secured credit facility); and (2) maintain a revolving credit facility of up to 600 million. 
 
 In August 2024, Sierra Pacific filed an application with the PUCN for authority to increase its debt ceiling from 1.9 billion to 4.0 billion for three years from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2028 (excluding borrowings under Sierra Pacific's 400 million secured credit facility); and (2) maintain a revolving credit facility of up to 600 million. An order approving the application was received in October 2024. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 Sierra Pacific has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the use of its secured revolving credit facility, capital contributions and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which Sierra Pacific has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including regulatory approvals, Sierra Pacific's credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; impacts to customer rates; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. Prudently incurred expenditures for compliance-related items such as pollution-control technologies, replacement generation and associated operating costs are generally incorporated into Sierra Pacific's regulated retail rates. Expenditures for certain assets may ultimately include acquisition of existing assets.

Sierra Pacific has included estimates from its latest IRP filing in its forecast capital expenditures for 2024. These estimates may change as a result of the RFP process. Sierra Pacific's historical and forecast capital expenditures include the following: 
 
 Electric distribution includes both growth projects and operating expenditures consisting of routine expenditures for distribution needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 Electric transmission includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Growth projects primarily relate to the Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program. Operating expenditures consist of routine expenditures for transmission and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 Wildfire mitigation includes operating expenditures for wildfire mitigation activities totaling 21 million and 15 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Planned spending for wildfire mitigation totals 34 million for the remainder of 2024. 
 Solar generation includes solar photovoltaic panels procured for future growth projects and a 400-MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 400-MW of co-located battery storage that would be developed in Churchill County, Nevada with ownership share approved by the PUCN of 10 Nevada Power and 90 Sierra Pacific. Commercial operation of the solar is expected by early 2027. 
 Electric battery storage includes a 400-MW battery energy storage system co-located with a 400-MW solar photovoltaic facility that would be developed in Churchill County, Nevada with ownership share approved by the PUCN of 10 Nevada Power and 90 Sierra Pacific. Commercial operation of the battery energy storage system is expected by mid 2026. 
 Other includes both growth projects and operating expenditures consisting of turbine upgrades at the Tracy generating facility, a repower project at the Valmy generating station to convert existing coal-fired combustion to natural gas-fired combustion that was approved by the PUCN, routine expenditures for generation, other operating projects and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 
 2024 Joint Integrated Resource Plan 
 
 In May 2024, the Nevada Utilities filed its Joint Application for approval of the 2024 Joint Integrated Resource Plan. The Joint Application seeks, in part (1) the addition of three power purchase agreements for solar generating resources totaling more than 1,000 MW, each with co-located battery storage systems; (2) the addition of 400 MW of company-owned hydrogen-capable natural gas simple cycle combustion turbine peakers at the North Valmy generation station; (3) to approve an update of the Greenlink Nevada transmission project costs; and (4) to construct the necessary transmission infrastructure to support growing customer demand. An order is expected by the end of 2024.

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes outside the normal course of business in material cash requirements from the information provided in Item 7 of Sierra Pacific's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than those disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 Sierra Pacific is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for discussion regarding Sierra Pacific's current regulatory matters. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 Sierra Pacific is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact Sierra Pacific's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. Sierra Pacific believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and Sierra Pacific is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, impairment of long-lived assets and income taxes. For additional discussion of Sierra Pacific's critical accounting estimates, see Item 7 of Sierra Pacific's Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in Sierra Pacific's assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors of 
 Eastern Energy Gas Holdings, LLC 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Eastern Energy Gas Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries ("Eastern Energy Gas") as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, and changes in equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of Eastern Energy Gas as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 23, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of Eastern Energy Gas' management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Eastern Energy Gas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 limited partner interests in Cove Point ("the Transaction"). Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 9, 2023, the Buyer paid billion in cash, plus the pro rata portion of the quarterly distribution made by Cove Point for the third fiscal quarter of 2023. Eastern Energy Gas funded the Transaction through cash provided by BHE GT S, LLC, which included an equity contribution of billion and the repayment of affiliated notes of million. The Buyer now owns an aggregate of of the limited partner interests, and its affiliate, Cove Point GP Holding Company, LLC, continues to own of the general partner interest, of Cove Point. Prior to the Transaction, Eastern Energy Gas owned of the general partner interest and of the limited partner interests in Cove Point. Eastern Energy Gas previously determined it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Cove Point's economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and benefits which could be significant to it and accordingly, consolidated Cove Point. Because Eastern Energy Gas controls Cove Point both before and after the Transaction, the changes in Eastern Energy Gas' ownership interest in Cove Point were accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized. In connection with the Transaction, Eastern Energy Gas recognized million of income taxes in equity primarily attributable to the step up in tax basis of the investment in Cove Point of million, partially offset by establishing additional regulatory liabilities related to excess deferred income taxes of million.

In December 2023, the FERC suspended the rate changes for five months following the proposed effective date, until June 1, 2024, subject to refund. In August 2024, a settlement agreement was filed with the FERC, resolving CGT's general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services and providing for increased service rates and depreciation rates. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, CGT's rates result in an average annual increase to firm transmission revenues of million over the settlement period and an increase in annual depreciation expense of million, compared to the rates in effect prior to June 1, 2024. FERC approval of the settlement is expected late 2024 or early 2025.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Eastern Energy Gas during the periods included herein. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Eastern Energy Gas' historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Eastern Energy Gas' actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations for the Third Quarter and First Nine Months of 2024 and 2023 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income attributable to Eastern Energy Gas for the third quarter of 2024 was 114 million, an increase of 22 million, compared to 2023. Net income increased primarily due to higher earnings from Cove Point of 39 million, largely due to the acquisition of an additional 50 limited partner interest in Cove Point, partially offset by one-time favorable income tax adjustments recorded in 2023 as a result of the acquisition of an additional 50 limited partner interest in Cove Point of 18 million. 
 
 Net income attributable to Eastern Energy Gas for the first nine months of 2024 was 453 million, an increase of 140 million, compared to 2023. Net income increased primarily due to higher earnings from Cove Point of 150 million, largely due to the acquisition of an additional 50 limited partner interest in Cove Point. 
 
 Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Operating revenue decreased 12 million, or 3 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a decrease in Cove Point's storage-related service revenues of 9 million and a decrease in variable revenue related to park and loan activity of 4 million, partially offset by an increase in regulated gas transmission service revenues due to the settlement of CGT's general rate case of 5 million. 
 
 Operations and maintenance decreased 14 million, or 9 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower outside services. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 5 million, or 6 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher plant placed in service of 3 million and the settlement of deprecation rates in CGT's general rate case of 2 million. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 5 million, or 14 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the repayment of 400 million of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Interest and dividend income decreased 5 million, or 63 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower outstanding loans under BHE GT S' intercompany revolving credit agreement. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 31 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 and the effective tax rate was 21 for 2024 and 3 for 2023. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to one-time favorable adjustments recorded in 2023, which was a result of the acquisition of an additional 50 limited partner interest in Cove Point. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 51 million, or 65 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of an additional 50 limited partner interest in Cove Point. 

First Nine Months of 2024 Compared to First Nine Months of 2023 
 
 Operating revenue decreased 56 million, or 4 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a decrease in Cove Point LNG variable revenue of 21 million, a decrease in variable revenue related to park and loan activity of 20 million and a decrease in Cove Point's storage-related service revenues of 20 million, partially offset by an increase in EGTS' regulated gas transmission and storage services revenues primarily due to higher volumes of 12 million and an increase in regulated gas transmission service revenues due to the settlement of CGT's general rate case of 6 million. 
 
 Cost of gas decreased 25 million, or 81 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the unfavorable revaluation of volumes retained in 2023. 
 
 190 

Operations and maintenance decreased 20 million, or 5 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower technology and related charges of 13 million, lower outside services of 9 million due to the termination of Dominion Energy Inc.'s transition services agreement and a decrease in salary and benefit expenses of 4 million, partially offset by a gain in 2023 from an agreement to convey development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields of 8 million. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 10 million, or 4 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher plant placed in service of 7 million and the settlement of deprecation rates in CGT's general rate case of 3 million. 
 
 Property and other taxes increased 1 million, or 1 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an adjustment in 2023 due to lower than estimated 2022 tax assessments of 6 million, partially offset by the expiration of Cove Point's payment in lieu of taxes program and the start of Cove Point's property tax credit agreement of 4 million. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 9 million, or 8 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the repayment of 250 million of long-term debt in the second quarter of 2023 and 400 million of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2023 of 17 million, partially offset by higher outstanding borrowings under BHE GT S' intercompany revolving credit agreement of 8 million. 
 
 Interest and dividend income decreased 21 million, or 75 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower outstanding loans under BHE GT S' intercompany revolving credit agreement. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 67 million, or 89 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 and the effective tax rate was 22 for 2024 and 11 for 2023. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to one-time favorable adjustments recorded in 2023, which was a result of the acquisition of an additional 50 limited partner interest in Cove Point. 
 
 Equity income increased 12 million, or 28 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher earnings from Iroquois due to favorable fixed negotiated rate agreements. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 226 million, or 69 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of an additional 50 limited partner interest in Cove Point of 216 million and lower net income attributable to Cove Point of 10 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Eastern Energy Gas' total net liquidity was as follows (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents 117 Intercompany revolving credit agreement 400 Total net liquidity 517 Intercompany revolving credit agreement: Maturity date 2025 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.0 billion and 982 million, respectively. The change is primarily due to the repayment of EGTS rate refunds to customers in 2023, the timing of payments for operating costs and other changes in working capital, partially offset by unfavorable operating results. 
 
 The timing of Eastern Energy Gas' income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods elected and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (240) million and 301 million, respectively. The change is primarily due to a decrease in repayments of notes by its parent under an intercompany revolving credit agreement of 734 million, proceeds from the assignment of shale development rights in 2023 of 8 million and an increase in capital expenditures of 3 million, partially offset by a decrease in notes issued to its parent under an intercompany revolving credit agreement of 198 million. 
 191 

Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were (749) million and consisted of net repayment of notes payable to affiliates of 400 million, distributions to noncontrolling interests from Cove Point of 123 million and distributions to its indirect parent, BHE, of 226 million. 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 were (1.3) billion. Sources of cash totaled 2.9 billion and consisted of proceeds from equity contributions to fund the Transaction. Uses of cash totaled 4.1 billion and consisted of 3.3 billion for the purchase of Cove Point noncontrolling interest, distributions to noncontrolling interests from Cove Point of 352 million, repayment of long-term debt of 250 million and distributions to its indirect parent, BHE, of 227 million. 
 
 Long-term debt 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas currently has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC to issue an additional 1.6 billion of long-term debt securities through January 11, 2027. 
 
 For a discussion of recent financing transactions, refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 
 of this Form 10-Q. In October 2024, EGTS entered into an agreement authorizing the issuance of 150 million of its 5.02 Senior Notes due 2034, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary terms and conditions, with an expected closing date in December 2024. EGTS intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay its 111 million Senior Notes due December 15, 2024, and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, intercompany revolving credit agreements, capital contributions and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, investments, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which Eastern Energy Gas and each subsidiary has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including regulatory approvals, Eastern Energy Gas' credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the natural gas transmission and storage and LNG export, import and storage industries. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, new growth projects and the timing of growth projects; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; impacts to customer rates; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas' historical and forecasted capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, are as follows (in millions): 
 Nine-Month Periods Annual Ended September 30, Forecast 2023 2024 2024 Natural gas transmission and storage 17 41 65 Other 224 203 292 Total 241 244 357 
 
 Natural gas transmission and storage primarily includes growth capital expenditures related to planned regulated projects. Other includes primarily nonregulated and routine capital expenditures for natural gas transmission, storage and LNG terminalling infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 
 192 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in cash requirements from the information provided in Item 7 of Eastern Energy Gas' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for discussion regarding Eastern Energy Gas' current regulatory matters. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. Eastern Energy Gas believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and Eastern Energy Gas is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets and income taxes. For additional discussion of Eastern Energy Gas' critical accounting estimates, see Item 7 of Eastern Energy Gas' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in Eastern Energy Gas' assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors of 
 Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. and subsidiaries ("EGTS") as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, and changes in shareholder's equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of EGTS as of December 31, 2023 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholder's equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 23, 2024 we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of EGTS' management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to EGTS in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Equity securities: Investment funds As of December 31, 2023: Assets: Money market mutual funds Equity securities: Investment funds 
 
 EGTS' investments in money market mutual funds and investment funds are stated at fair value. When available, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used to record the fair value. 
 
 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchase or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which EGTS transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, EGTS uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent EGTS' estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. EGTS bases its forward price curves upon market price quotations, when available, or internally developed and commercial models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations are obtained from independent brokers, exchanges, direct communication with market participants and actual transactions executed by EGTS. Market price quotations are generally readily obtainable for the applicable term of EGTS' outstanding derivative contracts; therefore, EGTS' forward price curves reflect observable market quotes. Market price quotations for certain natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable due to the length of the contracts. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, as well as for those contracts that are not actively traded, EGTS uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of these derivative contracts is a function of underlying forward commodity prices, related volatility, counterparty creditworthiness and duration of contracts. 
 
 EGTS' long-term debt is carried at cost on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of EGTS' long-term debt is a Level 2 fair value measurement and has been estimated based upon quoted market prices, where available, or at the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates consistent with comparable maturities with similar credit risks.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of EGTS during the periods included herein. This discussion should be read in conjunction with EGTS' historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. EGTS' actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations for the Third Quarter and First Nine Months of 2024 and 2023 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 47 million, an increase of 3 million, compared to 2023. 
 
 Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was 185 million, an increase of 14 million, compared to 2023. Net income increased primarily due to higher margin from regulated gas transmission and storage operations of 11 million, lower technology and related charges and lower outside services due to the termination of Dominion Energy Inc.'s transition services agreement, partially offset by a gain in 2023 from an agreement to convey development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields and an adjustment in 2023 due to lower than estimated 2022 tax assessments. 
 
 Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Operating revenue was flat for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a decrease in variable revenue related to park and loan activity of 4 million, partially offset by an increase in regulated gas sales for operational and system balancing purposes primarily due to increased volumes of 2 million. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 1 million, or 6 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 and the effective tax rate was 24 for 2024 and 27 2023. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the reduction in Pennsylvania's statutory rate. 

First Nine Months of 2024 Compared to First Nine Months of 2023 
 
 Operating revenue decreased 14 million, or 2 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a decrease in variable revenue related to park and loan activity of 20 million and a decrease in management services and other revenues of 6 million, partially offset by an increase in regulated gas transmission and storage services revenues primarily due to higher volumes of 12 million. 
 
 Cost of gas decreased 25 million, or 81 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the unfavorable revaluation of volumes retained in 2023. 
 
 Operations and maintenance decreased 13 million, or 4 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower technology and related charges of 9 million, lower outside services of 7 million due to the termination of Dominion Energy Inc.'s transition services agreement and a decrease in services provided to affiliates of 2 million, partially offset by a gain in 2023 from an agreement to convey development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields of 8 million. 
 
 Property and other taxes increased 7 million, or 20 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an adjustment in 2023 due to lower than estimated 2022 tax assessments of 6 million. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 4 million, or 7 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 and the effective tax rate was 25 for 2024 and 26 for 2023.

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 391 million and 317 million, respectively. The change is primarily due to the repayment of EGTS rate refunds to customers in 2023 and favorable operating results, partially offset by other changes in working capital. 
 
 The timing of EGTS' income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods elected and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (150) million and (159) million, respectively. The change is primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of 9 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were (217) million and consisted of dividends paid to Eastern Energy Gas of 215 million and the net repayment of notes payable to Eastern Energy Gas of 2 million. 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 were (162) million and consisted of dividends paid to Eastern Energy Gas of 141 million and the net repayment of notes payable to Eastern Energy Gas of 21 million. 
 
 Long-term Debt 
 
 In October 2024, EGTS entered into an agreement authorizing the issuance of 150 million of its 5.02 Senior Notes due 2034, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary terms and conditions, with an expected closing date in December 2024. EGTS intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay its 111 million Senior Notes due December 15, 2024, and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 EGTS has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, intercompany revolving credit agreements, capital contributions and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, investments, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which EGTS has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including regulatory approvals, EGTS' credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the natural gas transmission and storage industry. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, new growth projects and the timing of growth projects; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; impacts to customer rates; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. 
 209 

EGTS' historical and forecasted capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, are as follows (in millions): 
 Nine-Month Periods Annual Ended September 30, Forecast 2023 2024 2024 Natural gas transmission and storage 11 17 34 Other 152 137 206 Total 163 154 240 
 
 Natural gas transmission and storage includes primarily growth capital expenditures related to planned regulated projects. Other includes primarily pipeline integrity work, automation and controls upgrades, underground storage, corrosion control, unit exchanges, compressor modifications and projects related to Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration natural gas storage rules. The amounts also include EGTS' asset modernization program, which includes projects for vintage pipeline replacement, compression replacement, pipeline assessment and underground storage integrity. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in cash requirements from the information provided in Item 7 of EGTS' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 EGTS is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for discussion regarding EGTS' current regulatory matters. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 EGTS is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. EGTS believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and EGTS is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, impairment of long-lived assets and income taxes. For additional discussion of EGTS' critical accounting estimates, see Item 7 of EGTS' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in EGTS' assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.

PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The following disclosures reflect material updates to legal proceedings and should be read in conjunction with Item 3 of Berkshire Hathaway Energy's and PacifiCorp's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ENERGY AND PACIFICORP 
 
 In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to several major wildfires, including the 2020 Wildfires, which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries and loss of life, and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. The wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp's service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over 500,000 acres in aggregate. Third-party reports for these wildfires indicate over 2,000 structures destroyed, including residences; several structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. 
 
 In July 2022, the 2022 McKinney Fire began in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California located in PacifiCorp's service territory, burning over 60,000 acres. Third-party reports indicate that the 2022 McKinney Fire resulted in 11 structures damaged; 185 structures destroyed, including residences; 12 injuries; and four fatalities. 
 
 As described below, a significant number of complaints and demands alleging similar claims have been filed in Oregon and California related to the Wildfires. As of September 30, 2024, amounts sought in outstanding complaints and demands filed in Oregon and in certain demands made in California totaled approximately 3 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints and the mass complaints described below that seek 46 billion. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are excluded from this amount. For class actions, amounts specified by the plaintiffs in the complaints include amounts based on estimates of the potential class size, which ultimately may be significantly greater than estimated. Additionally, damages are not limited to the amounts specified in the initially filed complaints as plaintiffs are frequently allowed to amend their complaints to add additional damages and amounts awarded in a court proceeding may be significantly greater than the damages specified. Oregon law provides for doubling of economic and property damages in the event the defendant is found to have acted with gross negligence, recklessness, willfulness or malice. Oregon law provides for trebling of the damages associated with timber, shrubs and produce in the event the defendant is determined to have willfully and intentionally trespassed. 
 
 Investigations into the causes and origins of the Wildfires are ongoing. For more information regarding certain legal proceedings affecting Berkshire Hathaway Energy, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, and PacifiCorp, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

 United States Loss and Damages to Federal Lands Slater Fire 
 
 PacifiCorp received a notice of indebtedness from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service ("USFS") indicating that PacifiCorp owes 356 million for fire suppression costs, natural resource damages and burned area emergency response costs incurred by the USFS associated with the Slater Fire in California. The notice further indicates that the alleged amounts owed may not include all environmental damages to which the USFS may be entitled and which the U.S. may seek to recover if further action is taken to resolve the debt. Additional charges for interest, penalties and administrative costs may also be sought associated with amounts considered overdue. In January 2024, PacifiCorp received correspondence from the U.S. Department of Justice ("USDOJ") indicating its intent to litigate the matter due to PacifiCorp not having paid the 356 million. PacifiCorp is actively cooperating with the USDOJ on resolving these alleged claims, including through the pursuit of alternative dispute resolution.

 Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp and Consolidated Cases 
 
 On September 30, 2020, a class action complaint against PacifiCorp was filed, captioned Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp , Case No. 20CV33885 (" James ") in Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon. The complaint was filed by Oregon residents and businesses who sought to represent a class of all Oregon citizens and entities whose real or personal property was harmed beginning on September 7, 2020, by wildfires in Oregon allegedly caused by PacifiCorp. On November 3, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to limit the class to include Oregon citizens allegedly impacted by the Echo Mountain Complex, South Obenchain, 242 and Santiam Canyon fires, as well as to add claims for noneconomic damages. The amended complaint alleged that PacifiCorp's assets contributed to the Oregon wildfires occurring on or after September 7, 2020, and that PacifiCorp acted with gross negligence, among other things. The amended complaint seeks damages similar to those described above, including not less than 600 million of economic damages and in excess of 1 billion of noneconomic damages for the plaintiffs and the class. Numerous cases have been consolidated into James as described below. 
 
 On April 29, 2024, May 16, 2024, May 31, 2024, July 31, 2024 and September 11, 2024, five separate mass complaints against PacifiCorp naming 1,000, 100, 265, 78 and 93 individual class members, respectively, were filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon captioned Shane A Henson et al. v.

The James mass complaints also assert doubling of economic damages for each individual class member. The class members demand a trial by jury. Refer to " James Court Activity" section below for information regarding additional damages phase trials. 
 
 214 

James Trial Activity 
 
 On April 24, 2023, the jury trial for James with respect to the 17 named plaintiffs began in Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon. In June 2023, the jury issued its verdict finding PacifiCorp liable to the 17 named plaintiffs and to the class with respect to the four wildfires. The jury found PacifiCorp's conduct grossly negligent, reckless and willful as to each plaintiff and the entire class. The jury awarded the 17 named plaintiffs 90 million of damages, including 4 million of economic damages, 68 million of noneconomic damages and 18 million of punitive damages based on a 0.25 multiplier of the economic and noneconomic damages. 
 
 In September 2023, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon ordered trial dates for three damages phase trials described below wherein plaintiffs in each of the three damages phase trials would present evidence regarding their damages. 
 
 In January 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon entered a limited judgment and money award for the June 2023 James verdict. The limited judgment awards 92 million of damages based on the amounts awarded by the jury, as well as doubling of the economic damages and offsetting of any insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. Under Oregon Revised Statutes 82.010, interest at a rate of 9 per annum will accrue on the judgment commencing at the date the judgment was entered until the entire money award is paid, amended or reversed by an appellate court. In January 2024, PacifiCorp filed a notice of appeal associated with the June 2023 verdict in James , including whether the case can proceed as a class action and filed a motion to stay further damages phase trials. On February 14, 2024, the Oregon Court of Appeals denied PacifiCorp's request to stay the damages phase trials. On February 13, 2024, the 17 named plaintiffs filed a notice of cross-appeal as to the January 2024 limited judgment and money award. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. 
 
 In January 2024, the jury for the first James damages phase trial awarded nine plaintiffs 62 million of damages, including 6 million of economic damages and 56 million of noneconomic damages. After the jury verdict, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon doubled the economic damages to 12 million and added 16 million of punitive damages using the 0.25 multiplier determined by the jury for the June 2023 James verdict, bringing the total damages awarded to 84 million. PacifiCorp requested that the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon judge offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the nine plaintiffs, and on March 25, 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon granted in large part the offset request. In April 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon entered a limited judgment and money award for the January 2024 James verdict. The limited judgment awards 80 million of damages based on the amounts awarded by the jury and offsetting insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. In April 2024, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. PacifiCorp amended its January 2024 appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the January 2024 jury verdict. 
 
 In March 2024, the jury for the second James damages phase trial awarded ten plaintiffs 42 million of damages, including 12 million of doubled economic damages, 23 million of noneconomic damages and 7 million of punitive damages using the 0.25 multiplier determined by the jury for the June 2023 James verdict. PacifiCorp requested that the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon judge offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the ten plaintiffs and on May 6, 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon granted the offset request. In June 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon entered a limited judgment and money award for the March 2024 James verdict. The limited judgment awards 38 million of damages based on the amounts awarded by the jury and offsetting insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. In July 2024, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. PacifiCorp further amended its appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the March 2024 jury verdict. 
 
 Additional damages phase trials have been scheduled in 2025 as described below. 
 
 215 

James Court Activity 
 
 On May 31, 2024, plaintiffs' counsel in James filed a motion to enter a case management order that requests the creation of a special docket to establish a trial process through which up to five consolidated damages trials for collectively 50 class members would occur each month going forward. PacifiCorp opposed the motion and filed a competing motion on June 26, 2024. On October 2, 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon issued a case management order and identified discovery, pleading and other deadlines applicable to nine damages phase trials to be held in 2025. The trials will adjudicate the damages of 10 plaintiffs per trial starting February 3, March 24, April 21, May 12, June 2, July 7, September 9, October 6, and December 7, 2025. The case management order allows the plaintiffs to select three need-based plaintiffs per trial using the following criteria: (i) the plaintiff is of advanced age, specifically seventy years of age or older and/or (ii) the plaintiff is suffering from sickness or illness that may impede their ability to participate in a later trial. The Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon will randomly select the other seven plaintiffs. Within ten days after the verdict is rendered in the April 21 trial, and within 30 days after the verdict is rendered in the July 7 and December 7 trials, respectively, the parties are required to engage in global mediation with the objective of resolving the claims of the remaining absent class members. 
 
 On June 13, 2024, plaintiffs' counsel for the plaintiffs who have opted out of the James class filed a motion for the court to issue an order clarifying the scope of lead counsel in the damages phase to unrepresented members of the James class members. The opt-out plaintiffs' counsel describes in the motion its ability to have negotiated settlements for opt-out plaintiffs, bringing immediate financial relief and indicates that lead counsel for the class has placed its interests above those of the individuals they represent. On September 6, 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon denied in part the opt-out plaintiffs' counsel's motion to clarify the scope of lead counsel in the damages phase. Specifically, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon ruled that lead counsel continue to represent absent class members "regardless of whether or not the absent class members have signed a retainer agreement with lead counsel." However, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon clarified that absent class members could choose different legal representation, but each absent class member would have to expressly apply to the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon to be excluded from further representation by lead counsel and to terminate any ongoing attorney-client relationship. 
 
 On September 13, 2024, PacifiCorp filed a motion to make the James mass complaints more definite and certain. On October 4, 2024, in response to PacifiCorp's motion, the Multnomah County Circuit Court Oregon issued an order granting, in part, the motion. The order requires the plaintiffs selected for the nine damages phase trials scheduled in 2025 to file amended complaints alleging the specific facts that support their claims for economic and noneconomic damages.

 United States and State of Oregon Loss and Damages to Federal and State Lands Oregon Fires 
 
 PacifiCorp received correspondence from the USDOJ, representing the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, USFS, regarding the potential recovery of certain costs and damages alleged to have occurred to federal lands from the September 2020 Archie Creek and Susan Creek fires.

The amounts alleged for natural resource damage from these fires do not include intangible environmental and natural resource damages that the U.S. could potentially seek to recover if this matter was fully litigated, nor do they include multipliers which the agencies are allegedly entitled to collect under pertinent federal regulations, under which, for example, minimum damages for trespass to timber managed by the U.S. Department of Interior are twice the fair market value of the resource at the time of the trespass, or three times if the violation was willful. 
 
 PacifiCorp also received correspondence from the Oregon Department of Justice ("ODOJ"), representing the State of Oregon, regarding the potential recovery of losses and damages to state lands from the Archie Creek and Susan Creek fires.

 (10) If and when dividends payable on the Senior Securities shall be in default in an amount equal to four full quarterly payments or more per share, and thereafter until all dividends on the Senior Securities in default shall have been paid, the holders of the Senior Securities, voting separately from the Common Stock as one class, shall be entitled to elect the smallest number of directors necessary to constitute a majority of the full Board of Directors, and the holders of the Common Stock, voting separately from the Senior Securities as a class, shall be entitled to elect the remaining directors of the Company, anything herein and in the Bylaws of the Company to the contrary notwithstanding. The terms of office, as directors, of all persons who may be directors of the Company at the time shall terminate upon the election of a majority of the Board of Directors by the holders of the Senior Securities, except that if the holders of the Common Stock shall not have elected the remaining directors of the Company, then, and only in that event, the directors of the Company in office just prior to the election of a majority of the Board of Directors by the holders of the Senior Securities shall elect the remaining directors of the Company. Thereafter, while such default continues and the majority of the Board is being elected by the holders of Senior Securities, the remaining directors, whether elected by directors, as aforesaid, or whether originally or later elected by holders of the Common Stock, shall continue in office until their successors are elected by holders of the Common Stock and shall qualify. 
 (11) If and when all dividends then in default on the Senior Securities then outstanding shall be paid (such dividends to be declared and paid out of any funds legally available therefor as soon as reasonably practicable), the holders of the Senior Securities shall be divested of any special right with respect to the election of directors, and the voting power of the holders of Senior Securities and the holders of the Common Stock shall revert to the status existing before the first dividend payment date on which dividends on the Senior Securities were not paid in full, but always subject to the same provisions for vesting such special rights in the holders of the Senior Securities in the event of further like default or defaults in the payment of dividends thereon. Upon termination of any such special voting right upon payment of all accumulated and defaulted dividends on the Senior Securities, the terms of office of all persons who may have been elected directors of the Company by vote of the holders of Senior Securities as one class, pursuant to such special voting right, shall forthwith terminate, and the resulting vacancies shall be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, and directors so elected shall hold office until their successors are elected and shall qualify.

(12) In the case of any vacancy in the office of a director occurring among the directors elected by the holders of the Senior Securities, voting separately from the Common Stock as one class, the remaining directors elected by the holders of the Senior Securities, by affirmative vote of a majority thereof, or the remaining director so elected if there be but one, may elect a successor or successors to hold office for the unexpired term or terms of the director or directors whose place or places shall be vacant. Likewise, in case of any vacancy in the office of a director occurring among the directors not elected by the holders of the Senior Securities, the remaining directors not elected by the holders of the Senior Securities by affirmative vote of a majority thereof, or the remaining director so elected if there be but one, may elect a successor or successors to hold office for the unexpired term or terms of the director or directors whose place or places shall be vacant. 
 (13) Whenever the right shall have accrued to the holders of the Senior Securities to elect directors, voting separately from the Common Stock as one class, it shall be the duty of the President, a Vice-President or the Secretary of the Company forthwith to cause notice to be given to the shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting to be held at such time as the Company s officers may fix, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days after the accrual of such right, for the purpose of electing directors. At all meetings of shareholders held for the purpose of electing directors during such time as the holders of the Senior Securities shall have the special right, voting separately from the Common Stock as one class, to elect directors, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock shall be required to constitute a quorum of such class for the election of directors, and the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting rights, of the outstanding Senior Securities shall be required to constitute a quorum of such class for the election of directors provided, however, that the absence of a quorum of the holders of stock of either such class shall not prevent the election at any such meeting or adjournment thereof of directors by the other class, if the necessary quorum of the holders of stock of such other class is present in person or by proxy at such meeting or any adjournment thereof and provided further, that in the event a quorum of the holders of the Common Stock is present but a quorum of the holders of the Senior Securities is not present, then the election of the directors elected by the holders of the Common Stock shall not become effective and the directors so elected by the holders of Common Stock shall nor assume their offices and duties until the holders of the Senior Securities, with a quorum present, shall have elected the directors they shall be entitled to elect and provided further, however, that in the absence of a quorum of holders of stock of either class, a majority of the holders of the stock of such class who are present in person or by proxy shall have power to adjourn the election of the directors to be elected by such class from time to time without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until the requisite quorum of holders of such class shall be made present in person or by proxy, but such adjournment shall not be to a date beyond the date for the mailing of the notice of the next annual meeting of the Company or special meeting in lieu thereof. 
 (14) So long as any shares of Serial Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company shall not, without the consent (given by a vote at a meeting called for that purpose) of the holders of at least two-thirds of the total number of votes entitled to be cast by the shares of Serial Preferred Stock then outstanding 
 7 

(a) create or authorize any new stock ranking prior to such Serial Preferred Stock as to dividends, in liquidation, dissolution, winding up or distribution, or create or authorize any security convertible into shares of any such stock or 
 (b) amend, alter, change or repeal any of the express terms of such Serial Preferred Stock then outstanding in a manner substantially prejudicial to the holders thereof. 
 (15) So long as any shares of the Senior Securities are outstanding, the Company shall not, without the consent (given by vote at a meeting called for that purpose) of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the Senior Securities then outstanding, voting separately from the Common Stock, as one class 
 (a) merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation or corporations provided, that the provisions of this subparagraph (a) shall not apply to a purchase or other acquisition by the Company of franchises or assets of another corporation in any manner which does not involve a merger or consolidation or 
 (b) issue any unsecured notes, debentures or other securities representing unsecured indebtedness, or assume any such unsecured indebtedness, for purposes other than (i) the refunding of outstanding unsecured indebtedness theretofore issued or assumed by the Company, or (ii) the reacquisition, redemption or other retirement of all outstanding shares of the Senior Securities, if immediately after such issue or assumption the total principal amount of all unsecured notes, debentures or other securities representing unsecured indebtedness issued or assumed by the Company, including unsecured indebtedness then to be issued or assumed, would exceed thirty per centum (30 of the aggregate of (1) the total principal amount of all bonds or other securities representing secured indebtedness issued or assumed by the Company and then to be outstanding, and (2) the capital and surplus of the Company as then to be stated on the books of account of the Company or 
 (c) issue, sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of the Senior Securities or of any other class of stock ranking prior to, or on a parity with, the Senior Securities as to dividends or distributions, unless the net income of the Company determined, after provision for depreciation and all taxes and in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, to be available for the payment of dividends for a period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar months within the fifteen (15) calendar months immediately preceding the issuance, sale or disposition of such stock, is at least equal to twice the annual dividend requirements on all outstanding shares of the Senior Securities and all other classes of stock ranking prior to, or on a parity with, the Senior Securities as to dividends or distributions, including the shares proposed to be issued, computed, in the case of any such shares on which the dividend rate is subject to adjustment, at the dividend rate then in effect or, if such shares are the shares proposed to be issued, at the dividend rate initially established for such shares, and unless the gross income of the Company for such period, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices (but in any event after deducting the amount for said period charged by the Company on its books to depreciation expense and all taxes) to be available for the payment of interest, shall have been at least one and one-half times the sum of (i) the annual interest charges on all interest bearing indebtedness of the Company and (ii) the annual dividend requirements on all 
 8 

outstanding shares of the Senior Securities and all other classes of stock ranking prior to, or on a parity with, the Senior Securities as to dividends or distributions, including the shares proposed to be issued, computed, in the case of any such indebtedness or shares on which the interest or dividend rate is subject to adjustment, at the interest or dividend rate then in effect or, if such shares are the shares proposed to be issued, at the dividend rate initially established for such shares provided, that there shall be excluded from the foregoing computation interest charges on all indebtedness and dividends on all shares of stock which are to be retired in connection with the issue of such additional shares of Senior Securities or other class of stock ranking prior to, or on a parity with, the Senior Securities as to dividends or distributions and provided further, that in any case where such additional shares of Senior Securities or other class of stock ranking prior to, or on a parity with, the Senior Securities as to dividends or distributions, are to be issued in connection with the acquisition of new property, the net earnings of the property to be so acquired may be included on a pro forma basis in the foregoing computation, computed on the same basis as the net earnings of the Company or 
 (d) issue, sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of the Senior Securities, or of any other class of stock ranking prior to, or on a parity with, the Senior Securities as to dividends or distributions, unless the aggregate of the capital of the Company applicable to the Common Stock and the surplus of the Company shall be not less than the aggregate amount payable on the involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, in respect of all shares of the Senior Securities and all shares of stock, if any, ranking prior thereto, or on a parity therewith, as to dividends or distributions, which will be outstanding after the issue of the shares proposed to be issued provided, that if, for the purposes of meeting the requirements of this subparagraph (d), it becomes necessary to take into consideration any earned surplus of the Company, the Company shall not thereafter pay any dividends on shares of the Common Stock which would result in reducing the Company s Common Stock equity to an amount less than the aggregate amount payable, on dissolution, winding up or involuntary liquidation of the Company, on all shares of the Senior Securities and of any stock ranking prior to, or on a parity with, the Senior Securities as to dividends or other distributions, at the time outstanding. 
 (16) No holder of any stock or other securities of the Company now or hereafter authorized shall have any preemptive or other right to subscribe for, purchase or receive any unissued shares, treasury shares, or other shares of any class, whether now or hereafter authorized, or any notes, bonds, debentures, or other securities convertible into, or carrying options or warrants to purchase, shares of any class.
