of our common stock, par value

shares to 
shares and our outstanding common stock decreased from 
to .
The Reverse Stock Split did not affect our authorized common stock of 
shares or our common stock par value. All shares of common stock, including common stock underlying warrants, stock options,
restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, as well as exercise prices and per share information in these condensed
consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the Reverse Stock Split. 

million at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated a net loss of million and
used million in net cash for operating activities. To date, none of our drug candidates have been approved for sale, and therefore
we have not generated any product revenue and do not expect positive cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future. 

We
have financed our operations primarily through public equity issuances, including an offering we closed on January 30, 2024, where we
sold shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to shares of our common stock, and warrants for
the purchase of up to shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million, after deducting placement agent fees and
offering-related expenses. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale, the pre-funded warrants were exercised in exchange for 
shares of our common stock. 

In
May 2024, we filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-279588) (the Registration Statement ),
including a base prospectus relating to the offering of up to in the aggregate of the securities identified in the base prospectus
from time to time in one or more offerings; and a prospectus supplement relating to the shares of our common stock that may be issued
and sold under a sales agreement dated May 21, 2024 (the Sales Agreement between us and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners
(the Sales Agent ), through which we may issue and sell in a registered at the market offering shares of our
common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million (subject to adjustment) from time to time through or to our Sales
Agent (the ATM Offering ). We expect to use net proceeds, if any, from the ATM Offering over time for continued research
and development for our portfolio of drug candidates, especially our oncology products, and working capital and general corporate purposes.
The shares under the ATM Offering will be sold and issued pursuant to the Registration Statement. On July 31, 2024, we received 
in net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock under the ATM Offering. 

We do not have sufficient cash on hand or available to fund our operations
for the next twelve months. At
September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million. Based on our current business plans, we will need to obtain
additional funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities, complete a strategic transaction or other funding transactions in order to continue our Phase 2 trial of NGC-Cap and conduct future preclinical studies and clinical trials for
other drugs in our portfolio. In 2024, we started our Phase 2 trial of NGC-Cap in breast cancer, and on October 2, 2024, we dosed the
first patient in that trial. We will continue to be dependent upon equity and/or debt financing until we are able to generate positive
cash flows from our operations. 

We
plan to raise additional funds in the future through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations,
strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements, but will only do so if the terms are acceptable
to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or suspend our current or
planned future clinical trial plans, or research and development programs. This may also cause us to not meet obligations contained in
certain of our license agreements and put these assets at risk. To the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and
distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish
valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms
that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of
our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely
affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures. There can be no
assurance that future funding will be available when needed. 

Absent
additional funding, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our operations for a period of one year
or more after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are available to be issued based on the timing and amount
of our projected net loss from continuing operations and cash to be used in operating activities during that period of time. As a result,
substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these condensed consolidated
financial statements are available to be issued. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be different should we be unable to continue as a going concern based on the outcome of these uncertainties
described above.

Common
Stock 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to shares
of common stock in lieu of shares of common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), and warrants to purchase up to shares
of our common stock (the Common Warrants in a public offering (the Offering ). The Common Warrants have an
exercise price of , are immediately exercisable and expire on . The shares of common stock were offered at a combined
public offering price of per share and accompanying Common Warrant and per Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Common Warrant.
The Pre-Funded Warrants had an exercise price of and were exercised in full simultaneously with the closing of the Offering in
exchange for shares of our common stock. Gross proceeds in connection with the Offering were million. We received 
million in net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting the fees of the placement agent and other offering-related expenses. We also
issued to the placement agent warrants to purchase shares of common stock, exercisable at per share that expire on . 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also received approximately 
 in net proceeds from the sale of 
 shares of common stock under the ATM Offering
on July 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also issued (i) 
 shares of common stock to Elion Oncology, Inc. Elion in satisfaction of the third milestone event under the license agreement; (ii) 
 shares of common stock to a consultant in accordance
with their consulting agreement; and (iii) 
 shares of common stock to certain employees and
consultants, net of

stock vest over a three-year period upon meeting service requirements; RSUs for the future issuance of shares of common stock vested
upon grant due to regaining Nasdaq compliance; and RSUs for the future issuance of shares of common stock vest upon dosing the
first patient in our Phase 2 study in NGC-Cap. 

On
July 16, 2024, Russell Skibsted was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer CFO ). In addition to cash compensation, the
Compensation Committee awarded RSUs for the future issuance of shares of common stock to Mr. Skibsted, which vest accordingly:
 vest on July 16, 2025; vest upon reaching a market capitalization (i.e. total value of Processa s outstanding
shares of stock at the then current market price) of at least million; and vest upon receipt of cumulative financing(s) of
at least million. 

On
September 3, 2024, RSUs for the future issuance of shares of common stock were granted to our independent directors and vest
on the earlier of June 28, 2025 or the next annual shareholder meeting.

over a weighted average period of years. The unrecognized expense excludes approximately of expense related to certain grants
of RSUs with performance milestones that are not probable of occurring at this time. 

Holders
of our vested RSUs will be issued shares of our common stock upon meeting the distribution restrictions contained in their Restricted
Stock Unit Award Agreement. The distribution restrictions are different (longer) than the vesting schedule, imposing an additional restriction
on the holder. Unlike RSAs, while certain employees may hold fully vested RSUs, the individual does not hold any shares or have any rights
of a shareholder until the distribution restrictions are met. Upon distribution to the employee, each RSU converts into one share of
our common stock. The RSUs contain dividend equivalent rights. 

Warrants 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not grant any warrants to purchase shares of our common stock other than warrants to
purchase shares of common stock as part of the Offering (see Note 2). Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock
expired unexercised. We also repurchased a warrant issued to a consultant in 2023 for the purchase of shares of our common stock

Forward
Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that reflect, when made, the Company s expectations
or beliefs concerning future events that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements frequently are identified by the
words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, intend, project, 
 will be, will continue, will likely result, or other similar words and phrases. Similarly,
statements herein that describe the Company s objectives, plans or goals also are forward-looking statements. Actual results could
differ materially from those projected, implied or anticipated by the Company s forward-looking statements. Some of the factors
that could cause actual results to differ include: our limited operating history, limited cash and history of losses; our ability to
achieve profitability; our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund our business operations in the future; our ability to secure
required FDA or other governmental approvals for our product candidates and the breadth of the indication sought; the impact of competitive
or alternative products, technologies and pricing; whether we are successful in developing and commercializing our technology, including
through licensing; the adequacy of protections afforded to us and/or our licensors by the anticipated patents that we own or license
and the cost to us of maintaining, enforcing and defending those patents; our and our licensors ability to protect non-patented
intellectual property rights; our exposure to and ability to defend third-party claims and challenges to our and our licensors 
anticipated patents and other intellectual property rights; and our ability to continue as a going concern. For a discussion of these
and all other known risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements,
see Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is available
on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement,
and the Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after
the date hereof. 

For
purposes of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, references to the Company, 
 we, us or our refer to the operations of Processa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its direct and
indirect subsidiaries for the periods described herein. 

Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on utilizing our Regulatory Science Approach, which includes the principles associated
with FDA s Project Optimus Oncology initiative and the related FDA Draft Guidance, in the development of Next Generation Chemotherapy NGC oncology drug products. Our mission is to provide better treatment options than those that presently exist by extending
a patient s survival and/or improving a patient s quality of life. This is achieved by improving upon FDA-approved, widely
used oncology drugs or the cancer-killing metabolites of these drugs by altering how they are metabolized and/or distributed in the body,
including how they are distributed to the actual cancer cells. 

Our
Regulatory Science Approach was conceived in the early 1990s when the founders of Processa and other faculty at the University of Maryland
worked with the FDA to develop multiple FDA Guidance Documents. Regulatory science is the science of developing new tools, standards,
and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of all FDA-regulated products. Over the last 30 years, two of
our founders, Dr. David Young and Dr. Sian Bigora, have expanded the original regulatory science concept by adding focused pre-clinical
and clinical studies to justify the benefit-risk assessment required for FDA approval when designing the development programs of new
drug products. 

Our
Regulatory Science Approach identifies the scientific information that the FDA requires to determine whether the benefit outweighs the
risk of a drug in a specific population of patients and at a specific dosage regimen for a specific drug product. The studies are designed
to obtain the necessary scientific information to support the regulatory decision. 

Recently,
the FDA has taken steps to define some of the regulatory science required for the FDA approval of oncology products. Through the FDA s
Project Optimus Oncology Initiative and the related Draft Guidance on determining the optimal dosage regimen for an oncology
drug, the FDA has chosen to make the development of oncology drugs more science-based than in the past. Since the principles of the FDA s
Project Optimus and the related Draft Guidance have been used by our Regulatory Science Approach in a number of non-oncology drugs in
the past, our experience with the principles of Project Optimus differentiates us from other biotechnology companies by focusing us not
only on the clinical science, but also on the equally important regulatory process. We believe utilizing our Regulatory Science Approach
provides us with three distinct advantages: 

greater
 efficiencies (e.g., the right trial design and trial readouts); 

greater
 possibility of drug approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; and 

greater
 ability to evaluate the benefit-risk of a drug compared to existing therapy, which allows prescribers to provide better treatment
 options for each patient. 

Our
strategic prioritization is to advance our pipeline of NGC proprietary small molecule oncology drugs. The NGC products are new chemical
entities that change the metabolism, distribution and/or elimination of already FDA-approved cancer drugs, or their active metabolites,
while maintaining the drug s proven mechanism of action in killing cancer cells. We believe our NGC treatments will provide improved
safety-efficacy profiles when compared to their currently marketed counterparts capecitabine, gemcitabine, and irinotecan.

Our
Drug Pipeline 

Our
pipeline currently consists of NGC-Cap, NGC-Gem and NGC-Iri (also identified as PCS6422, PCS3117 and PCS11T, respectively) and two
non-oncology drugs (PCS12852 and PCS499). The non-oncology drugs are not included in the pipeline chart above, as we are seeking
partners to continue their clinical and commercial development. A summary of each drug is provided
below. 

Next
Generation Chemotherapy 

Historically,
much of oncology drug development has searched for novel or different ways to treat cancer. Our approach is to take three current
FDA-approved cancer drugs, e.g. capecitabine, gemcitabine and irinotecan, and modify and improve how the human body metabolizes
and/or distributes these NGC treatments compared to their presently approved counterpart chemotherapy drugs while maintaining the
cancer-killing mechanism of action; thus, our reason for calling our drugs Next Generation Chemotherapy treatments. Part of the
development includes determining the optimal dosage regimen based on the dose-response relationship as described in the FDA s
Project Optimus Initiative and Draft Optimal Dosage Regimen Oncology Guidance. To date, we have data that we believe suggests our
NGC treatments are likely to have much better safety-efficacy profiles than the current widely used marketed counterpart drugs, not
only potentially making the development and approval process more efficient, but also clearly differentiating our NGC treatments
from the existing treatment. We believe our NGC treatments have the potential to extend the survival and/or quality of life for more
patients diagnosed with cancer while decreasing the number of patients who are required to dose-adjust or discontinue treatment
because of side effects or lack of response.

Next
Generation Chemotherapy Pipeline 

Next
 Generation Capecitabine NGC-Cap is a combination of PCS6422 and a lower dose of the FDA-approved cancer drug capecitabine.
 PCS6422 is an orally administered irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase DPD ). DPD metabolizes
 5-Fluorouracil 5-FU ), the major metabolite of capecitabine and widely used itself as an intravenous chemotherapeutic
 agent in many types of cancer, to multiple metabolites classified as catabolites. These catabolites do not have any cancer-killing
 properties but frequently cause dose-limiting side effects that may require dose adjustments or discontinuation of therapy. 

Capecitabine,
 as presently prescribed and FDA-approved, forms the cancer drug 5-FU which is then further metabolized to anabolites (which kill
 both cancer cells and normal duplicating cells) and catabolites (which cause side effects and have no cancer killing properties).
 When capecitabine is given in combination with PCS6422 in NGC-Cap, PCS6422 significantly changes the metabolism of 5-FU, which results
 in a change in the distribution of 5-FU within the body. Due to this change in metabolism and the overall metabolite profile of anabolites
 and catabolites, the side effect and efficacy profile of NGC-Cap has been found to be different from capecitabine given without PCS6422.
 Since the potency of NGC-Cap is also greater than FDA-approved capecitabine based on the 5-FU systemic exposure per mg of capecitabine
 administered, the amount of capecitabine anabolites formed from 1 mg of capecitabine administered in NGC-Cap will, therefore, be
 much greater than formed from the administration of 1 mg of existing capecitabine. 

The
 Phase 1B trial in patients with advanced refractory gastrointestinal tract tumors demonstrated that the irreversible inhibition of
 DPD by PCS6422 could alter the metabolism, distribution and elimination of 5-FU, making NGC-Cap significantly (up to 50 times) more
 potent than capecitabine alone and potentially leading to higher levels of anabolites which can kill replicating cancer and normal
 cells. By administering NGC-Cap to cancer patients, the balance between anabolites and catabolites changes depending on the dosage
 regimens of PCS6422 and capecitabine used, making the efficacy-safety profile of NGC-Cap different than that of FDA-approved capecitabine
 and requiring further evaluation of the PCS6422 and capecitabine regimens to determine the optimal NGC-Cap regimens for patients. 

In
 order for NGC-Cap to provide a safer and more efficacious profile for cancer patients compared to existing chemotherapy, understanding
 how the different regimens of PCS6422 and capecitabine may affect the systemic and tumor exposure to the anabolites, as well as the
 systemic exposure to the catabolites, is required. This can be achieved by following the timeline of DPD irreversible inhibition
 and the formation of new DPD using the plasma concentrations of 5-FU and its catabolites. 

In
an effort to better estimate the timeline of DPD inhibition and formation of new DPD, we modified the protocol for the Phase 1B trial
and began enrolling patients in the amended Phase 1B trial in April 2022. On November 1, 2022, we announced that data from the Phase
1B trial identified multiple dosage regimens with potentially better safety and efficacy profiles than currently existing chemotherapy
regimens. Since 5-FU exposure is dependent on both the PCS6422 regimen and the capecitabine regimen, safe regimens were identified as
well as regimens that cause dose-limiting toxicities DLTs ). One of the early regimens in the Phase 1B trial did cause
DLTs in two patients, one of whom died. No other DLTs were noted in the study. The Phase 1B trial has completed enrollment. 

Although the primary objective of the NGC-Cap Phase 1B trial in patients
with advanced, progressive cancer was to evaluate safety, the Phase 1B trial showed that treatment with NGC-Cap resulted in both a much
greater efficacy response rate and a longer period of progression-free survival than what has been reported for capecitabine. In all evaluable
progressive disease patients receiving PCS6422 and seven days of capecitabine, partial response and stable disease were observed in 66.7 
(8 out of 12) of the evaluable patients, including two with partial response and six with stable disease. The length of progression-free
survival was approximately five to 11 months across these patients. By comparison, in the capecitabine product label, 301 metastatic colorectal
cancer patients treated with monotherapy capecitabine had an overall response rate of approximately 21 and the time to progression of
approximately 4.5 months. In addition, even with up to 10x greater exposure to its 5-FU cancer treatment metabolite than capecitabine,
only one patient on NGC-Cap had a mild case of hand-foot syndrome, meaning the hand-foot syndrome rate in our Phase 1B trial was 6 versus
the expected ~50 based upon published data. Other side effects, even with 10x greater exposure, were similar or better than seen with
capecitabine as approved by FDA. 

Based on communications and meetings with the FDA, we submitted a new IND
for the treatment of advanced and metastatic breast cancer and received IND clearance from the FDA on July 24, 2024. The Phase 2 trial
has been initiated and will be a global multicenter, open-label, adaptive design trial comparing two different doses of NGC-Cap to FDA-approved
monotherapy capecitabine in approximately 60 to 90 patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial is designed to evaluate
the safety-efficacy profile of NGC-Cap versus monotherapy capecitabine, to determine the potential optimal dosage regimens of NGC-Cap
as required by the FDA Project Optimus Initiative. Our license agreement with Elion for NGC-Cap requires us to use commercially reasonable
efforts, at our sole cost and expense, to research, develop and commercialize products in one or more countries, including meeting specific
diligence milestones that include dosing a first patient with a product in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial on or before October 6, 2024.
On October 2, 2024, the first patient in our Phase 2 trial of NGC-Cap was dosed. 

17 

NGC-Gem
 is a cytidine analog similar to gemcitabine (Gemzar ), but different enough in chemical structure that some patients are more
 likely to respond to PCS3117 than gemcitabine. In addition, we believe those patients inherently resistant or who acquire resistance
 to gemcitabine are likely not to be resistant to NGC-Gem. The difference in response occurs because NGC-Gem is metabolized to its
 active metabolite through a different enzyme system than gemcitabine. The Phase 2A trial in patients with
relapsed or refractory pancreatic cancer was completed by Ocuphire prior to us licensing NGC-Gem. We plan to meet with the FDA to discuss potential trial designs including implementation of the Project Optimus initiative
 as part of the design. Similar to NGC-Cap, we will need to obtain additional funding before we can begin any future trial for NGC-Gem. 

Our
 license agreement with Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Ocuphire for NGC-Gem requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts,
 at our sole cost and expense to oversee such commercialization efforts, to research, develop and commercialize products in one or
 more countries, including meeting specific diligence milestones that consist of: (i) dosing a patient in a clinical trial prior to
 June 16, 2024; and (ii) dosing a patient in a pivotal clinical trial or in a clinical trial for a second indication of the drug prior
 to June 16, 2026. We are currently in discussions with Ocuphire to extend these deadlines. 

NGC-Iri is an analog of SN38 (SN38 is the active metabolite of irinotecan)
and should have an improved safety/efficacy profile in every type of cancer that irinotecan is presently used. The manufacturing process
and sites for drug substance and drug product are presently being evaluated and IND-enabling toxicology studies will then be initiated.
A preclinical study in mouse xenograft models showed that after PCS11T administration, there was greater accumulation of SN-38 in the
tumor compared with other tissues than after irinotecan or Onivyde administration. Additionally, less SN-38 accumulated in non-cancer
tissues, such as muscle, after NGC-Iri administration than after irinotecan or Onivyde administration, supporting the potential for
a better NGC-Iri safety profile. We are defining the potential paths to approval, which include defining the targeted patient population
and the type of cancer. In 2025, we plan to expand the preclinical analysis, including additional preclinical efficacy and toxicity studies;
evaluate manufacturing options for PCS11T; and conduct chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) activities and pre-IND enabling studies. 

We
are focused on drug products that improve the survival and/or quality of life for patients by improving the safety and/or efficacy of
the drug in a targeted patient population, while providing a more efficient and probable path to FDA approval and differentiating our
drugs from those on the market or are currently being developed. 

Other
Drugs in Our Pipeline 

In
2023, we completed our Phase 2A trial for PCS12852 in gastroparesis patients with positive results. Additionally, in February 2023, due
primarily to the inability to identify and enroll patients in our rare disease Phase 2 trial for PCS499 in ulcerative Necrobiosis Lipoidica,
we decided to cease further enrollment in the PCS499 trial and terminated the trial. We did not experience any safety concerns during
the conduct of either the PCS12852 or PCS499 trial. We continue to evaluate options to monetize these non-core drug assets, which may
include out-licensing or partnering these assets with one or more third parties. We are currently in discussions with Yuhan to amend our existing license agreement for PCS12852.

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
January 22, 2024, we effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split, reducing the number of our common shares issued on that date from 24,706,474
shares to 1,291,000 shares. There is no corresponding reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock and no change in the
par value per share. All share and per share amounts and conversion and exercise prices presented herein have been adjusted retroactively
to reflect this change. 

Public
Offering 

On
January 30, 2024, we raised gross proceeds of 7.0 million (net proceeds of 6.3 million) from the sale of 476,000 shares of our common
stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,079,555 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 1,555,555 shares of our common
stock in a public offering, as described in Note 2. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale, the pre-funded warrants were exercised
in exchange for 1,079,555 shares of our common stock. We are using the net proceeds from this financing for continued research and development
for NCG-Cap, and working capital and general corporate purposes. 

ATM
Offering 

In
May 2024, we filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-279588) (the Registration Statement ),
including a base prospectus relating to the offering of up to 50,000,000 in the aggregate of the securities identified in the base prospectus
from time to time in one or more offerings; and a prospectus supplement relating to the shares of our common stock that may be issued
and sold under a sales agreement dated May 21, 2024 (the Sales Agreement between us and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners
(the Sales Agent ), through which we may issue and sell in a registered at the market offering shares of our
common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 2.4 million (subject to adjustment) from time to time through or to our Sales
Agent (the ATM Offering ). We expect to use net proceeds, if any, from the ATM Offering over time for continued research
and development for our portfolio of drug candidates, especially our oncology products, and working capital and general corporate purposes.
The shares under the ATM Offering will be sold and issued pursuant to the Registration Statement. On July 31, 2024, we received 931,000

Research
and Development Expenses 

Our
research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include (i) program and testing related expenses
including external consulting and professional fees related to the product testing and our development activities and (ii) internal research
and development staff salaries and other payroll costs including stock-based compensation, payroll taxes and employee benefits. 

Costs
for the three- and nine-month periods for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our preclinical, clinical trial and other costs increased when compared to the same period
in 2023. This was attributable to an increase of approximately 1.3 million for ongoing testing and related expenses related to our Phase
1B trial for NGC-Cap and the IND/initiation of our Phase 2 trial for NGC-Cap and offset by a decrease in professional fees of approximately
 181,000, mostly attributable to a decrease in patent-related legal fees. During the same period in 2023, in addition to clinical trial
costs for NGC-Cap, we were incurring closing costs in our clinical trial for PCS12852 and PCS499. We also had an approximately 11,000
increase in salaries and related costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, due
to one-time bonuses and increased salary rates for the research and development team in 2024. This was offset by a decrease in stock-based
compensation of approximately 23,000. 

20 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had increases in testing and related expenses of approximately 1.5 million and in salaries
and related costs of approximately 87,000, when compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were offset by decreases in professional
fees of approximately 315,000 and in stock-based compensation of approximately 155,000. The reasons for the changes between the nine-month
periods in 2024 and 2023 are the same as the reasons between the three-month periods in 2024 and 2023. 

On
July 24, 2024, we received approval of our IND for our Phase 2 trial for NGC-Cap in breast cancer. On October 2, 2024, we dosed the first
patient in the study. As we continue this Phase 2 trial and complete our Phase 1B clinical trial for NGC-Cap, we anticipate our research
and development costs will increase. We will also continue incurring nominal costs for NGC-Gem as we prepare to meet with the FDA to
discuss potential study designs and for NGC-Iri as we prepare to further define the clinical development program, GMP CMC processes and
the IND-enabling toxicology studies. 

The
funding necessary to bring a drug candidate to market is subject to numerous uncertainties. Once a drug candidate is identified, the
further development of that drug candidate may be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors. These factors include,
but are not limited to, funding constraints, safety or a change in market demand. For each of our drug candidate programs, we periodically
assess the scientific progress and merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable.
Some programs may be terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization. 

Our
clinical trial cost accruals are based on estimates of patient enrollment and related costs at clinical investigator sites, as well as
estimates for the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct
and manage clinical trials on our behalf. 

We
estimate preclinical and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed, pursuant to contracts with research institutions and
clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. In accruing service fees,
we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of patient enrollment and activity expended in each period.
If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly.
Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the receipt of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses
and expensed when the services are rendered.

General
and Administrative Expenses 

Our
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 121,000 to 1.1
million from 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due primarily as a result of an
approximately 81,000 increase in employee stock-based compensation; an approximately 12,000 increase in professional fees, mostly
attributable to an increase of legal and consulting fees; an approximately 21,000 increase in salaries and other payroll-related
costs from increased salary rates, primarily paid to our executive officers; and a net increase of approximately 14,000 in travel,
office and other miscellaneous expenses. We also received approximately 7,000 more in reimbursements from CorLyst during the three
months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 749,000 to 3.8
million from 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was due primarily to a decrease in professional fees of
approximately 943,000 as a result of a non-recurring expense that was incurred during 2023 in connection with the stock purchase
warrant granted to the placement agent for our registered direct offering in February 2023; and
a decrease in employee stock-based compensation of approximately 167,000 in 2024.
These decreases were primarily offset by increases in salaries and other payroll-related expenses of approximately 303,000 and in
office and other related expenses of approximately 51,000. We also received approximately 7,000 less in reimbursements from
CorLyst during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. 

Other
Income, net 

Other
income represents interest income of approximately 40,000 and 86,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,

Net
cash used in operating activities 

We
used net cash in our operating activities of 8,997,321 and 5,939,478 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to increased costs related to closing our Phase 1B and commencing
our Phase 2 trial for NGC-Cap, including the prepayment of expenses paid to our CRO for the Phase 2 trial; increased salaries and other
payroll-related expenses; and professional fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

As
we continue our development of NGC-Cap and evaluate the other NGC drugs in our portfolio, we anticipate our research and development
efforts and ongoing general and administrative costs will continue to generate negative cash flows from operating activities for the
foreseeable future. We anticipate our clinical trial costs will increase when compared to prior periods since we have begun our
Phase 2 clinical trial for NGC-Cap and our prior year activities related primarily to the completion of our Phase 1b trial for
NGC-Cap. 

Net
cash used in investing activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used net cash in our investing activities of 3,244 and 2,776, respectively, to
purchase property and equipment. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 476,000 shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,079,555 shares
of common stock in lieu of shares of common stock, all of which were exercised into shares of our common stock, and warrants to purchase
up to 1,555,555 shares of our common stock pursuant to a public offering for net proceeds of 6.3 million. We also sold 374,190 shares
of common stock under our ATM Offering for net proceeds of approximately 931,000. We used cash, classified as financing activities,
of approximately 16,000 to pay income taxes owed on stock-based compensation, approximately 9,000 for the settlement of a stock award,
and approximately 4,000 for payments owed under a financing lease obligation. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we raised net proceeds of 6.4 million from the sale of 421,611 shares of our common stock. 

23 

Liquidity 

We do not have sufficient cash on hand or available to fund our operations
for the next twelve months. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we began initiation activities for our Phase 2 trial for NGC-Cap in breast cancer. At
September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 2.9 million. Based on our current business plans, we will need to
obtain additional funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities or complete a strategic transaction or other funding
transactions in order to continue our Phase 2 trial of NGC-Cap and conduct future preclinical studies and
clinical trials for other drugs in our portfolio. 

Absent
additional funding, our current cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our planned operations for a period of one year
or more after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued based on the timing and amount
of our projected net loss from continuing operations and the related amount of cash to be used in operating activities during that period
of time. Our ability to execute our longer-term operating plans, including future preclinical studies and clinical trials for our portfolio
of drugs depend on our ability to obtain additional funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities, a strategic transaction or
other funding transactions. 

We
have incurred losses since inception, currently devoting substantially all of our efforts toward research and development of our next
generation chemotherapy drug product candidates, including conducting clinical trials and providing general and administrative support
for these operations, and have an accumulated deficit of 84.5 million at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we generated a net loss of 9.1 million and used 9.0 million in net cash for operating activities from continuing operations.
To date, none of our drug candidates have been approved for sale, and therefore we have not generated any product revenue and do not
expect positive cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future. 

We
have financed our operations primarily through public equity issuances, including an offering we closed on January 30, 2024 in which
we sold 476,000 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,079,555 shares of our common stock, and warrants
for the purchase of up to 1,555,555 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 6.3 million, after deducting placement agent fees
and offering-related expenses. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale, the pre-funded warrants were exercised in exchange for 1,079,555
shares of our common stock. 

Further,
in May 2024, we filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-279588) (the Registration Statement ),
including a base prospectus relating to the offering of up to 50,000,000 in the aggregate of the securities identified in the base prospectus
from time to time in one or more offerings; and a prospectus supplement relating to the shares of our common stock that may be issued
and sold under a sales agreement dated May 21, 2024 (the Sales Agreement between us and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners
(the Sales Agent ), through which we may issue and sell in a registered at the market offering shares of our
common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 2.4 million (subject to adjustment) from time to time through or to our Sales
Agent (the ATM Offering ). We expect to use net proceeds, if any, from the ATM Offering over time for continued research
and development for our portfolio of drug candidates, especially our oncology products, and working capital and general corporate purposes.
The shares under the ATM Offering will be sold and issued pursuant to the Registration Statement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 931,000
in net proceeds from the sale of 374,190 shares of common stock under the ATM Offering on July 31, 2024. 

We
plan to raise additional funds in the future through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations,
strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements, but will only do so if the terms are acceptable
to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or suspend our current or
planned future clinical trial plans, or research and development programs. This may also cause us to not meet obligations contained in
certain of our license agreements and put these assets at risk. To the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and
distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish
valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms
that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of
our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely
affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures. There can be no
assurance that future funding will be available when needed.

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

There
have been no significant changes to the contractual obligations reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2023. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At
September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. 

We
believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described in the Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K
have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Actual results
could differ from the estimates we use in applying our critical accounting policies. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely
events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. 

There
have been no changes in our critical accounting policies from those included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

We
have evaluated recently issued accounting pronouncements and determined that there is no material impact on our financial position or
results of operations. 

25 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Item
3 is not applicable to us as a smaller reporting company and has been omitted. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

At
September 30, 2024, management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act. Based on the evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Part
II. Other Information 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

As
of the date of this report, to our knowledge, there are no legal proceedings or regulatory actions material to us to which we are a party,
or have been a party to, or of which any of our property is or was the subject matter of, and no such proceedings or actions are known
by us to be contemplated, except as provided below: 

As
previously disclosed in our Current report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, on May 7, 2024, the Company received notification
from Elion purporting to terminate the license agreement by and between the Company and Elion as a result of the Company s alleged
breach thereof. The Company believes that Elion s claims are without merit and disputes that the license agreement has been validly
terminated. On July 5, 2024, the Company filed a complaint seeking monetary damages, declaratory judgement and injunctive relief. On
August 14, 2024, the Company received Elion s answer and counterclaims. On October 10, 2024, the Company filed its response to
Elion s counterclaims. The Company intends to enforce its rights under the license agreement and will pursue such other remedies
as it determines are appropriate. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

There
have been no material changes to our risk factors as described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, other than the addition of the following risk factor: 

Our
licenses are subject to termination by the licensor in certain circumstances. 

Our
rights to practice the inventions claimed in the licensed patents and patent applications are subject to our licensors abiding by the
terms of those licenses and not terminating them. Our licenses may be terminated by the licensor if we are in material breach of certain
terms or conditions of the license agreement or in certain other circumstances. Our license agreements each include provisions that allow
the licensor to terminate the license if (i) we breach any payment obligation or other material provision under the agreement and fail
to cure the breach within a fixed time following written notice of termination; (ii) we or any of our affiliates, licensees or sublicensees
directly or indirectly challenge the validity, enforceability, or extension of any of the licensed patents; or (iii) we declare bankruptcy
or dissolve. The majority of license agreements require us to satisfy due diligence milestones that relate to the development of new
products containing the licensed drug or the agreement may be terminated by such counterparty. Our rights under these licenses are subject
to our continued compliance with the terms of the license, including the payment of royalties due under the licenses. Termination of
any of these licenses could prevent us from marketing some or all of our products. Because of the complexity of our products and the
patents we have licensed, determining the scope of the license and related royalty obligations can be difficult and can lead to disputes
between us and the licensor. An unfavorable resolution of such a dispute could lead to an increase in the royalties payable pursuant
to the license. If a licensor believed we were not paying the royalties due under the license or were otherwise not in compliance with
the terms of the license, the licensor might attempt to revoke the license. If such an attempt were successful, we might be barred from
producing and selling some or all of our products. 

26 

As
previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, on May 7, 2024, the Company received notification
from Elion purporting to terminate the license agreement by and between us and Elion as a result of the Company s alleged breach
thereof. The Company believes that Elion s claims are without merit and disputes that the license agreement has been validly terminated.
We are now in litigation regarding our license agreement. The Company intends to enforce its rights under the license agreement and will
pursue such other remedies as it determines are appropriate. 

If
we are unsuccessful or are unable to enforce our rights under the license agreement, our business and results of operations may be adversely
affected. 

Item

(a)

 Securities Act ), in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

(b)
