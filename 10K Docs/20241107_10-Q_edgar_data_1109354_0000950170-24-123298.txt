million. Contract Balances The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, note receivables and unbilled receivables (contract assets) and deferred revenue, customer deposits and billings in excess of revenue recognized (contract liabilities) on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Contract assets Most of the Company s long-term contracts and revenues from certain instrument rental and reagent agreements are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. Billing often occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets. Contract assets are classified as either other current assets or other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The balance of contract assets as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was million and million, respectively. Contract liabilities The Company often receives cash payments from customers in advance of the Company s performance, resulting in contract liabilities. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of when revenue recognition is expected. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the contract liabilities were million and million, respectively of which million and million respectively, consist of the current portion of these contract liabilities. The increase in the contract liability balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily the result of new cash payments received, which was offset in part by satisfying performance obligations. Approximately million of the contract liability balance on December 31, 2023 was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Total consideration allocated 

NanoString Technologies, Inc. On May 6, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and rights associated with the business of NanoString Technologies, Inc. including the equity interests of the six subsidiaries (collectively, NanoString for approximately million in cash consideration. The Company also assumed certain of its liabilities, including potential liabilities associated with ongoing litigations. See Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies for more details on these litigations. NanoString develops end-to-end research solutions in the spatial biology field and provides life-science research solutions for spatial transcriptomics and gene expression analysis which have been critical in enabling scientists and medical researchers to advance vital discovery, translational, and pre-clinical disease research. NanoString is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and will be integrated into BSI NANO Segment. NanoString forms part of the Company s Bruker Spatial Biology division, which was formed to coordinate the Company s spatial platforms across spatial genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The Company has recorded the provisional determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the information available as of the time of the issuance of these financial statements. Accordingly, the values recognized are subject to change until the Company finalizes the allocation of consideration transferred during the measurement period, which is no later than one year from the acquisition date. The final determination may result in asset and liability values that are different than the preliminary estimates. During the third quarter of 2024 the Company recorded certain measurement period adjustments relating to the provisional amounts recorded for intangible assets and goodwill relating to updates to the Company s valuation and other assumptions. These measurement period adjustments were not material and there was no material impact to the Company's consolidated statements of income that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments were recognized as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets has been estimated using the income approach through a discounted cash flow analysis. The cash flow analysis is based on the forecasts used by the Company to price the acquisition, and the discount rates applied were benchmarked by referencing the implied rate of return of the Company s pricing model and the weighted average cost of capital, reflecting a market discount rate. Using a residual method, any excess between the consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company believes goodwill represents the future economic benefits of the acquisition that are not individually identifiable, such as synergies between the acquired assets and the Company s existing spatial biology platforms.

of the outstanding share capital of TecInvest S. r.l, Eliman 1 S. r.l,, and Eliman 2 S. r.l, and their 100 interests in 18 subsidiaries (collectively ELITech or ELITech Group for million of cash consideration before allowing for customary closing adjustments that occurred in the third quarter of 2024. The total consideration transferred was million net of cash acquired and customary closing adjustments. ELITechGroup s subsidiaries are active in the molecular diagnostics, m icrobiology and biomedical testing equipment field and, as such, have been integrated into the BSI CALID Segment. ELITech s primary locations include Turin in Italy, Signes in France, Logan in Utah and Bothell in Washington. The Company has recorded a provisional determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the information available to us as of the time of the issuance of these financial statements. Accordingly, the values recognized are subject to change until the Company finalizes the allocation of the consideration transferred during the measurement period, which is no later than one year from the acquisition date. The final determination may result in asset and liability values that are different than the preliminary estimates. During the third quarter of 2024, as a result of the finalization of the contractual net working capital adjustment, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment to the carrying amount of goodwill. This measurement period adjustment was not material. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets has been estimated using the income approach through a discounted cash flow analysis. The cash flow analysis is based on the forecasts used by the Company to price the acquisition, and the discount rates applied were benchmarked by referencing the implied rate of return of the Company s pricing model and the weighted average cost of capital, reflecting a market discount rate. Using a residual method, any excess between the consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company believes goodwill to represent future economic benefits of the acquisition that are not individually identifiable, primarily expected synergies from combining the businesses such as the elimination of surplus facilities and headcount, and the utilization of the Company s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses products and services. The amortization period for the intangible assets acquired ranges from five to for customer relationships, ten to for developed technology, for tradename, and for a favorable executory contract. Chemspeed Technologies AG On March 6, 2024, the Company acquired of the outstanding share capital of Chemspeed Technologies AG and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Chemspeed Technologies Inc., Chemspeed Technologies Ltd., and Chemspeed Technologies GmbH, (collectively Chemspeed for cash consideration of million CHF (approximately million). Chemspeed provides automated laboratory research and development and quality control workflow solutions in a wide range of chemical research fields. Chemspeed is domiciled in F llinsdorf, Switzerland and was integrated into the BSI BBIO Segment. The Company has recorded the provisional determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the information available as of the time of the issuance of these financial statements. Accordingly, the values recognized are subject to change until the Company finalizes the allocation of the consideration transferred during the measurement period, which is no later than one year from the acquisition date. The final determination may result in asset and liability values that are different than the preliminary estimates. During the second quarter of 2024 the Company recorded certain measurement period adjustments relating the provisional amounts recorded for accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue, intangible assets and goodwill relating to updates to the Company s valuation and other assumptions. These measurement period adjustments were not material and there was no impact to the Company's consolidated statements of income that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments were recognized as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets has been estimated using the income approach through a discounted cash flow analysis. The cash flow analysis is based on the forecasts used by the Company to price the acquisition, and the discount rates applied were benchmarked by referencing the implied rate of return of the Company s pricing model and the weighted average cost of capital, reflecting a market discount rate. Using a residual method, any excess between the consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company believes goodwill represents the future economic benefits of the acquisition that are not individually identifiable. The Company expects significant synergies related to the acquired technology that will be integrated into Bruker s existing platforms to offer a full set of lab workplace automated solutions.

The pro forma financial information above for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 also include the results of NanoString as though this asset acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2023. NanoString was unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, following NanoString and certain of its subsidiaries filing voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on February 4, 2024. Further, management considers that results of NanoString for the period from January 1, 2024, through May 6, 2024, are unlikely to be meaningful to users of these financial statements given the operations and financial results of NanoString were inherently materially impacted by the bankruptcy declaration. Accordingly, the pro forma financial information for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 do not include the results of NanoString from January 1, 2024, through its acquisition date of May 6, 2024, as it is impractical to obtain meaningful and reliable historical financial statements after the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

 Zontal, Inc. On May 4, 2023, Bruker Switzerland AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company acquired of the outstanding share capital of OSTHUS Beteiligungs GmbH and its wholly owned subsidiaries: OSTHUS Group GmbH, Zontal Inc., Zontal GmbH, and Zontal Data Information Technology (Dalian) co., Ltd, (collectively, the Zontal Companies for EUR million (approximately million) with the potential for additional consideration of up to million if certain revenue and EBITDA targets are met through 2025. Zontal, Inc, is the main operating company. The Zontal Companies offer various software applications and integrations including data management (Informatics and SDMS), which enables customers to harmonize, preserve and reuse their data to generate efficiencies and automate workflows. The Zontal Companies are domiciled in Aachen, Germany, and are integrated into the BSI BioSpin Segment. Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement with the noncontrolling interest holders that provides the Company with the right to purchase, and the noncontrolling interest holders with the right to sell, the remaining of the Zontal Companies at a contractually defined redemption value exercisable in 2027 and 2031. The rights (embedded derivative) to the option shares can be exercised at a discounted redemption value upon certain events related to post combination employment services. As the options are tied to continued employment, the Company classified the hybrid instrument (noncontrolling interest with an embedded derivative) as a long-term liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The hybrid instrument associated with the options is initially measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition, the carrying value of the hybrid instrument is remeasured to fair value with changes recorded to stock-based compensation expense in proportion to the requisite service period vested. The amortization period for the intangible assets acquired is eight years for technology, ten years for the trade name, and thirteen years for the customer relationships.

of the outstanding stock of Biognosys, AG Biognosys ), a privately held company, for cash consideration of CHF million (approximately million) less assumed liability for employee awards of CHF million (approximately million). Biognosys offers mass spectrometry based next-generation proteomics contract research services as well as proprietary proteomics software and laboratory consumables to support academic, pharma and biotech research and clinical development. Biognosys is domiciled in Zurich, Switzerland, and was integrated into the BSI CALID Segment. Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement with the noncontrolling interest holders that provides the Company with the right to purchase, and the noncontrolling interest holders with the right to sell, the remaining of Biognosys for cash to the founders at a contractually defined redemption value exercisable beginning in 2028. The option price to acquire the remaining equity interest will have a minimum redemption, or floor, value at each purchase or sell date, subject to post combination employment. The fair value at the acquisition date of these put option rights has been bifurcated into two financial instruments to separately account for the amounts attributable to the put option rights to sell the non-controlling interests on exercise dates at (1) above the minimum redemption value and (2) the minimum redemption value or floor value that is subject to post combination employment (the hybrid instrument) services. The rights (embedded derivative) to the option shares can be sold at a minimum redemption value provided certain post combination employment services are met or at fair value, if above the floor, on the purchase or sell date. Therefore, the portion assigned to the minimum redemption value of option value of the hybrid instrument, which is tied to continued employment of the noncontrolling interest holders, was classified as a long-term liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The hybrid instrument was initially measured at fair value on the acquisition date and shall be accreted over the post combination service period. The acquisition date fair value of the hybrid instrument which is an embedded derivative was not material. The rights associated with the portion of the noncontrolling interest above the minimum redemption value are contingently redeemable at the option of the Company or the noncontrolling interest holders. As redemption of the rights is contingently redeemable at the option of the noncontrolling interest shareholders, the Company classifies the carrying amount of these rights in the mezzanine section on the consolidated balance sheet, which is presented above the equity section and below liabilities. The redeemable noncontrolling interest is initially measured at fair value on the acquisition date and subsequently at the greater of the amount that would be paid if settlement occurred as of the balance sheet date based on fair value as defined in the purchase agreement and its carrying amount adjusted for net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Adjustments to the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are recorded through retained earnings. The amortization period for the intangible assets acquired is seven years for the technology and nine years for the customer relationships. The trade name was determined to have an indefinite life. The Company expects to amortize backlog through the end of 2025. Other 2023 Acquisitions During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company acquired other businesses which were accounted for under the acquisition method that complemented the Company's existing product offerings.

Derivative financial instruments are classified within Level 2 because there is not an active market for each derivative contract. However, the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are obtained from active markets. The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Fair value treatment may be elected either upon initial recognition of an eligible asset or liability or, for an existing asset or liability, if an event triggers a new basis of accounting. The Company did not elect to remeasure any of its existing financial assets or liabilities and did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets or liabilities which originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Company will continue to monitor developments in implementation as more countries enact the legislation.

ITEM 2.	 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Any statements other than statements of historical fact contained in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Without limiting the foregoing, the words believe, anticipate, plan, expect, seek, may, will, intend, estimate, should and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 
 Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: 
 the impact of supply chain challenges on our business and operations; 

our working capital requirements and the sufficiency of our cash, borrowings and proceeds of indebtedness to fund our operations and investment activities; 

our plans to make capital investments; 

the impact of changes to tax and accounting rules and changes in law; 

fluctuations in estimates impacting costs related to our self-funded health insurance plan; 

our expectations regarding backlog and revenue; 

our expectations and the impact of our restructuring initiatives; 

the impact of our global IT transformation activities; 

the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and changes in commodity prices; and 

any other statements that address events or developments that the Company intends or believes will or may occur in the future. 

Actual results may differ from those referred to in any forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We expressly disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements other than as required by law. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Although our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, we believe that describing revenue and expenses, excluding the effects of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, as well as certain other charges, net, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We rely internally on certain measures that are not calculated according to GAAP. These measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow. 
 Our management believes that these financial measures provide relevant and useful information that is widely used by equity analysts, investors and competitors in our industry, as well as by our management, in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance and are useful measures to evaluate our continuing business. Additionally, management believes free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business as it indicates the amount of cash generated after additions to property, plant, and equipment which is available for, among other things, investments in our business, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and repayment of debt. 
 We regularly use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business results and make operating decisions. We also measure our employees and compensate them, in part, based on such non-GAAP measures and use this information for our planning and forecasting activities. These measures may also be useful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and it may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable among companies. 
 34 

Table of Contents 

We define our non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 
 Non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit excluding costs related to restructuring actions, acquisition and related integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, costs associated with our global information technology transition initiatives, and other non-operational costs non-GAAP adjustments ). 

Non-GAAP gross profit margin as GAAP gross profit margin excluding the impact of non-GAAP adjustments. 

Non-GAAP operating income as GAAP operating income excluding non-GAAP adjustments. 

Non-GAAP operating margin as GAAP operating margin excluding the impact of non-GAAP adjustments. 

Free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment. 

OVERVIEW 
 We are a developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-performance scientific instruments and analytical and diagnostic solutions that enable our customers to explore life and materials at microscopic, molecular and cellular levels. Our corporate headquarters are located in Billerica, Massachusetts. We maintain major technical and manufacturing centers in Europe, Asia and North America and we have sales offices located throughout the world. Bruker is organized into four reportable segments: the Bruker Scientific Instruments (BSI) BioSpin Segment, the BSI Chemicals, Applied Markets, Life Science, In Vitro Diagnostics, Detection (CALID) Segment, the BSI NANO Segment and the Bruker Energy Supercon Technologies (BEST) Segment. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, Bruker acquired ELITech, Nanostring and Chemspeed. ELITech and Nanostring extend our capabilities in molecular diagnostics and life science analytical instruments. The Chemspeed acquisition brings to Bruker new capabilities in lab automation. The ELITech business will be integrated in the BSI CALD segment, the Nanostring acquisition will be integrated into the BSI NANO segment and the Chemspeed business will be integrated into the BSI BioSpin segment. 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 121.6 million, or 16.4 , to 864.4 million, compared to 742.8 million for the comparable period in 2023. Approximately 12.5 of the revenue growth during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributed to acquisitions, and another 0.7 from favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign exchange rate movements and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased 3.1 . Revenue increases were driven by demand for our differentiated high-value scientific instruments and life science solutions compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 276.8 million, or 13.1 , to 2,386.8 million, compared to 2,110.0 million for the comparable period in 2023. Approximately 9.2 of the revenue growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was attributed to acquisitions, and was offset by a decrease of 0.1 from unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange rate movements and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased 4.0 . Revenue increases were driven by demand for our differentiated high-value scientific instruments and life science solutions compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Our gross profit margin decreased to 48.4 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 51.5 in the same period in 2023, as a result of product mix, acquisition related costs, increases in purchased intangible amortization related to acquisitions in the period, slightly offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. 
 Our gross profit margin decreased to 48.4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 51.3 in the same period in 2023, as a result of product mix, acquisition related costs, increases in purchased intangible amortization and step up inventory costs related to acquisitions in the period, and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. 
 Our income tax provision in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 14.8 million and 30.8 million, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 26.8 and 25.8 , respectively. Our income tax provision in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 50.7 million and 80.6 million, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 33.6 and 26.6 , respectively. The increase in the Company's effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in jurisdictional mix and net unfavorable discrete items. 
 Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.27, a decrease of 0.33 compared to 0.60 per share in the same period in 2023. Diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.67, a decrease of 0.83 compared to 1.50 per share in the same period in 2023. The decrease in diluted earnings per share in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was driven primarily by net income, which decreased compared to the same periods in the prior year related to mix of profitability from acquisitions and acquisition related expenses.

Our non-GAAP operating margin decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to acquisitions and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. We also increased sales and marketing activities and investments in our research and development capabilities, as compared to 2023. 
 We can experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of various factors, some of which are outside our control, such as: 
 global general economic conditions including inflation and currency volatility, and geopolitical conditions, including conflicts in Russia and Ukraine, Israel, Palestine and surrounding areas, tensions between the United States and China, and tariff and trade policy changes; 

potential energy shortages in Europe where we have significant operations and overall higher energy and transportation costs; 

the time it takes between the date customer orders and deposits are received, systems are shipped and accepted by our customers and full payment is received; 

the worldwide shortage of semiconductor chips, components and raw materials, such as copper; 

the time it takes for us to receive critical materials to manufacture our products; 

36 

Table of Contents 

costs related to and impacts from acquisitions of technology or business; 

the time it takes for customers to construct or prepare their facilities for our products; 

fluctuations in estimates impacting costs related to our self-funded health insurance plan; and 

costs related to addressing any potential cybersecurity threats. 

Several of these factors have in the past affected and continue to affect the amount and timing of revenue recognized on sales of our products and receipt of related payments and will likely continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not necessarily be an indication of any future quarter s operating performance. 
 Maintaining business continuity and service levels to our customers 
 Ensuring our ability to supply our enabling technologies and solutions and maintaining high service levels for our customers is a top priority for Bruker. We are continuing capital investments in production facilities for efficiencies and expansion. We continue to encounter supply chain risks associated with the global economy and increasing geopolitical tensions, including inflation, banking industry volatility, the threat of recession, financial liquidity, currency volatility or devaluation, and the worldwide shortage of semiconductor chips, components, and raw materials such as copper. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to: revenue recognition; stock-based compensation expense; restructuring and other related charges; income taxes, including the recoverability of deferred tax assets; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reductions for excess and obsolete inventories; estimated fair values of long-lived assets used to measure the recoverability of long-lived assets; intangible assets and goodwill; expected future cash flows used to measure the recoverability of intangible assets and long-lived assets; warranty costs; derivative financial instruments; and contingent liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, current market and economic conditions, industry trends, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates and historical experience. 
 We believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most estimation and subjective judgment: 
 Revenue recognition; 

Income taxes; 

Goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets; and 

Business combinations. 

For a further discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Note 1, Description of Business in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We anticipate that our existing cash and credit facilities will be sufficient to support our operating and investing needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future cash requirements could be affected by acquisitions that we may complete, purchases of our common stock or the payment of dividends in the future. Historically, we have financed our growth and liquidity needs through cash flow generation from operations and a combination of debt financings and issuances of common stock. In the future, there are no assurances that we will continue to generate cash flow from operations or that additional financing alternatives will be available to us, if required, or, if available, will be obtained on terms favorable to us. 
 Effective in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company entered into a multi-currency notional cash pooling agreement with a financial institution to manage cash flow more efficiently and optimize liquidity. See Note 1, Description of Business in the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our notional cash pooling agreement. 
 Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 148.1 million and 488.3 million, respectively, of which 302.6 million and 398.4 million, respectively, related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside of the United States in our foreign subsidiaries, most significantly in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. We aggregate all bank accounts that are subject to the notional pooling arrangement into a single balance on our consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, we were not in a net overdraft position with respect to the notional cash pooling arrangement.

Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of 230.5 million, partially offset by a change in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions of 169.2 million. Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulted primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of 353.7 million, partially offset by a change in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures of 209.1 million. The decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items was due to lower net income as result of increased costs from recent acquisitions, acquisition related costs, and increased purchase intangible amortization as compared to the same period in the prior year. The change in operating assets and liabilities, net of
