 Kodak s Brazilian operations are involved in various litigation matters in Brazil and have received or been the subject of numerous governmental assessments related to indirect and other taxes in various stages of litigation, as well as civil litigation and disputes associated with former employees and contract labor. The tax matters, which comprise the majority of the litigation matters, are primarily related to federal and state value-added taxes. Kodak s Brazilian operations are disputing these matters and intend to vigorously defend its position. Kodak routinely assesses all these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability in its Brazilian operations and records its best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where it assesses the likelihood of loss as probable. As of September 30, 2024 , Kodak s Brazilian operations maintained accruals of approximately million for claims aggregating approximately million inclusive of interest and penalties where appropriate. The unreserved portion of the indirect taxes, civil litigation and disputes associated with former employees and contract labor claims, inclusive of any related interest and penalties, for which there was at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, amounted to approximately million.

The matter securing the lien on the non-cash assets was resolved in favor of Kodak s Brazilian operations on March 12, 2024 and those operations are in the process of having the lien on those assets removed.

The plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motions to dismiss/for summary judgment on November 14, 2022, and the Company and the individual defendants filed responses to the plaintiffs opposition on December 27, 2022 and December 23, 2022, respectively. A hearing with respect to the motions to dismiss/for summary judgment was held on August 9, 2023, and the lawsuit was dismissed in its entirety with prejudice on September 26, 2023. The plaintiffs/appellants filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal on October 25, 2023 and filed their brief on appeal on March 21, 2024. The Company filed its response brief on June 20, 2024, and the plaintiffs/appellants filed their reply brief on July 11, 2024. 
 
 Additional shareholder derivative lawsuits may be brought based on the other Derivative Demands (any such lawsuits, collectively with the State Derivative Lawsuit, the Federal Derivative Lawsuit and the Fiduciary Class Action, the Fiduciary Matters ). The Company, acting through a Special Committee of Independent Directors, previously determined that there was no merit to the claims alleged by the Derivative Demands made through the time of its determination (except with respect to the charitable contribution, which was not fully considered by the Special Committee). See the Company s Current Report on Form 8 K filed with the SEC on September 16, 2020. The Company, acting through a separate Special Litigation Committee of Independent Directors, concurred with the first Special Committee s findings and further concluded that it is not in the Company s interest to bring or allow any other shareholder to assert any of the claims alleged by the State Derivative Lawsuit or Federal Derivative Lawsuit (with the exception of the Peters claim purportedly arising under Section 10 (b) of the Exchange Act, which was not addressed as no demand was made with respect to such claim). The second Special Litigation Committee will carefully review any other additional complaints constituting Fiduciary Matters which may be filed. 

The DFC Announcement has also prompted investigations by several congressional committees, the SEC and the New York Attorney General s office. The Company has cooperated in those investigations. 
 
 In addition, Kodak is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, remediations and proceedings, including, from time to time, commercial, customs, employment, environmental, tort and health and safety matters, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. Kodak is also subject, from time to time, to various assertions, claims, proceedings and requests for indemnification concerning intellectual property, including patent infringement suits involving technologies that are incorporated in a broad spectrum of Kodak s products. These matters are in various stages of investigation and litigation and are being vigorously defended. Based on information currently available, Kodak does not believe that it is probable that the outcomes in these various matters, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and judgments could be rendered or settlements entered that could adversely affect Kodak s operating results or cash flows in a particular period. Kodak routinely assesses all of its litigation and threatened litigation as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records its best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where it assesses the likelihood of loss as probable.

 The net effect of foreign currency forward contracts in the results of operations is shown in the following table: 

Kodak had derivatives designated as hedging instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 In the event of a default under any of the Company s credit agreements, or a default under any derivative contract or similar obligation of Kodak, subject to certain minimum thresholds, the derivative counterparties would have the right, although not the obligation, to require immediate settlement of some or all open derivative contracts at their then-current fair value, but with liability positions netted against asset positions with the same counterparty. 

Fair Value 
 Fair values of Kodak s foreign currency forward contracts are determined using observable inputs (Level 2 fair value measurements) and are based on the present value of expected future cash flows (an income approach valuation technique) considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration of the contracts. The gross fair value of foreign currency forward contracts in an asset position are reported in Other current assets and the gross fair value of foreign currency forward contracts in a liability position are reported in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The gross fair value of forward contracts in an asset position as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million. The gross fair value of foreign currency forward contracts in a liability position as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million. 
 
 Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized based on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The fair values of long-term debt (Level 2 fair value measurements) are determined by reference to quoted market prices of similar instruments, if available, or by pricing models based on the value of related cash flows discounted at current market interest rates. The fair values of long-term borrowings were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and the current portion of long-term debt approximate their fair values at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

Print revenues accounted for 70 and 71 of Kodak s total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Advanced Materials and Chemicals revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 71 million and 203 million, respectively, an increase of 7 million (11 and 6 million (3 compared to the prior year quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. 
 
 Economic Environment and Other Global Events : 
 Kodak's products are sold and serviced in numerous countries across the globe with more than half of sales generated outside the U.S. Current global economic conditions remain highly volatile due to the uncertain and unpredictable macroeconomic environment, heightened levels of inflation, the war in Ukraine, the conflicts involving Israel, and other global events which impacted Kodak s operations. Kodak is experiencing revenue declines and increased manufacturing costs for certain businesses due to lower volumes and increases in labor, material and distribution costs, as well as supply chain disruptions and shortages in materials and labor. 
 Kodak implemented various pricing actions and customer-focused initiatives largely in 2022 and 2023 to mitigate the impact of increased manufacturing costs, primarily within its Print and Advanced Materials and Chemicals segments. While these actions have positively impacted the profitability of these segments, certain businesses are experiencing pricing pressures. 

[30]

Table of Contents 

The Print segment is experiencing a slowdown in customer demand for plates that negatively impacted volume due to current global economic conditions and the impact of pricing actions. In addition to the pricing actions and customer-focused initiatives described above, Kodak has implemented supply chain and workforce optimization, productivity improvements and other cost savings activities. The combined actions have largely mitigated the impact of lower volumes and increased manufacturing costs. However, the potential worsening of economic conditions, continued decreases in volume and increases in manufacturing and other costs without further price increases, productivity improvements or other cost savings measures, could unfavorably impact this segment's operating results. 
 
 The Electrophotographic Printing Solutions business (the "EPS Business") within the Print Segment is experiencing higher than expected volume declines in 2024 due to the negative impact of recent pricing actions and ceasing the manufacturing of NEXFINITY printers effective December 2022. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Kodak recorded an inventory reserve adjustment of 4 million to reflect lower forecasted demand associated with certain component and service parts sold to its installed base of printers. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining net inventory balance for component and service parts approximated 5 million. In addition, the EPS Business was notified during the third quarter of 2024 that the primary distributor of its black and white consumables and service parts initiated actions to accelerate the decline of this business and has significantly reduced its forecasted demand. The EPS Business is exploring various options to realize the full value of this inventory, including contractual rights under the distributor agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the net inventory for black and white consumables and service parts approximated 7 million. 
 The Advanced Materials and Chemicals segment has also experienced labor shortages in certain manufacturing areas. Increased demand for consumer film products along with manufacturing equipment limitations and labor shortages have contributed to increased backorders. Kodak has increased headcount in this segment to better meet demand, and improved the infrastructure and streamlined processes to increase capacity in the film business, but supply will continue to be constrained by manufacturing equipment limitations without further capital improvements. 
 
 Kodak has implemented numerous measures to mitigate the challenges associated with supply chain disruptions and shortages in materials, including increasing safety stock on certain materials, increasing lead-times, providing suppliers with longer forecasts of future demand and certifying additional sources or substitute materials where possible. These measures have enabled Kodak to largely meet current demand. 
 
 Following the cessation of U.S. plate manufacturing operations by Kodak s key competitors, Kodak has faced increasing competition in the U.S. from low-priced plates imported from China and Japan. On September 28, 2023, Kodak filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission ITC requesting relief from unfairly traded imports of plates from China and Japan in the form of the imposition of anti-dumping and/or countervailing duties on such imported plates. After making an affirmative preliminary determination on November 15, 2023, on October 22, 2024 the ITC made a final determination that a U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of aluminum lithographic printing plates from China and Japan that the Commerce Department has determined are sold at less than fair value and subsidized by the government of China. The Commerce Department conducted investigations to determine dumping and subsidy margins against imports of plates manufactured in China and Japan. The Commerce Department announced preliminary findings in its countervailing duty investigation on imports of plates manufactured in China on February 27, 2024 and announced preliminary findings in its anti-dumping duty investigations on imports of plates manufactured in China and Japan on April 26, 2024, which were amended with respect to plates from China on May 28, 2024. The Commerce Department announced final findings in its anti-dumping duty investigations on imports of plates manufactured in China and Japan and its countervailing duty investigation on imports of plates manufactured in China on September 23, 2024. As a result of the determinations by the ITC and Commerce Department, duties are now being imposed on U.S. imports of plates as follows: (i) anti-dumping duties of 115.84 on such plates manufactured in China by Fuji and 317.43 on such plates manufactured in China by other entities (in each case, imposed on plates imported on or after May 1, 2024), (ii) countervailing duties of 35.66 on practically all such plates manufactured in China (imposed on plates imported on or after March 1, 2024), and (iii) anti-dumping duties of 91.83 on practically all such plates manufactured in Japan (imposed on plates imported on or after May 1, 2024). There can be no assurance that the duties imposed on imported plates will provide Kodak effective relief and will not be reduced or impaired by any appeal or other challenge. 
 
 Kodak is monitoring the events surrounding the conflicts involving Israel and the impact on the operations of its Israel subsidiary. A leased warehouse in Israel was destroyed in 2023; however, none of Kodak s employees were injured. While the potential impact of future developments related to this conflict is difficult to predict at this time, Kodak has been able to adapt its operations to avoid material disruption to its business. The direct operations of Kodak s Israel subsidiary are less than 1 of total consolidated revenue and assets as of September 30, 2024.

Kodak also continues to monitor the events surrounding the war in Ukraine and the various sanctions imposed in response to the war. Kodak believes it is in compliance with all sanctions. Kodak is experiencing worldwide supply constraints for aluminum and increased energy and transportation costs due in part to the war in Ukraine. The extent to which the war in Ukraine will impact the global economy and Kodak's business and operations remains uncertain. 
 
 The war in Ukraine and the international response have disrupted Kodak s ability to operate its Russian subsidiary in the ordinary course, affecting its ability to pay vendors and employees, receive amounts owed from customers in Russia and deliver product. Kodak is in the process of an orderly winding down of its Russian subsidiary and has ceased its direct Russian operations. The direct operations of Kodak s Russian subsidiary did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements (less than 1 of total consolidated revenues and assets for 2021 - 2023), and there were no material impacts on the consolidated results of operations as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from the wind-down activities. 
 
 The ongoing changes in global economic conditions and the impact of other global events on Kodak s operations and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on several factors such as the slowdown in customer demand, the ability to offset higher labor, material and distribution costs through pricing actions, duration of supply chain disruptions and the ability to secure raw materials and components. 
 
 Kodak s strategy : 
 Segments within the print industry and the film industry face competition from digital substitution. Kodak s strategy is to: 

Focus product investment in core competency areas of print and advanced materials, leveraging Kodak s proprietary technologies to deliver technologically advanced products in the product goods packaging, graphic communications, and functional printing markets; 

Grow revenues through a focus on customers in Kodak s print division, increasing overall share; 

Promote the use of film and expand the applications of Kodak s film and chemicals to best utilize the existing infrastructure; and 

Continue to streamline processes to drive cost reductions and improve operating leverage. 

A discussion of opportunities and challenges related to Kodak s strategy follows: 

Print s digital plate products include traditional digital plates and Kodak SONORA Process Free Plates. SONORA Process Free Plates allow Kodak customers to skip the plate processing step prior to mounting plates on a printing press. This improvement in the printing process saves time and costs for customers. Also, SONORA Process Free Plates reduce the environmental impact of the printing process because they eliminate the use of chemicals (including solvents), water and power that is otherwise required to process a traditional plate. The segment's digital plate products are experiencing challenges from higher prices and availability of raw materials, digital substitution and competitive pricing pressures. Kodak seeks to mitigate the impact of increases in manufacturing costs through a combination of surcharges and price increases, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives. In addition, Kodak seeks to offset the impact of short-term and long term market dynamics on pricing and volume pressures through innovations in Kodak product lines, including investing in digital print technologies. 

In Print's digital printing businesses, the PROSPER business is expected to grow as the legacy VERSAMARK business continues to decline as a percentage of the segment s total revenue. The PROSPER Inkjet Systems business is expected to continue to build profitability. Kodak launched the PROSPER 7000 Turbo Press in June 2022. The PROSPER 7000 Turbo Press enables commercial, publishing and newspaper printers to compete more effectively with offset and to shift more long run jobs from conventional printing processes to inkjet. Investment in the next generation technology, ULTRASTREAM, is focused on the ability to place ULTRASTREAM writing systems in Kodak branded presses and in various original equipment manufacturers in applications ranging from commercial print to packaging. In addition, Kodak officially launched the KODAK PROSPER ULTRA 520 Digital Press utilizing Kodak s ULTRASTREAM inkjet technology, which offers offset print quality in a smaller footprint.

Advanced Materials and Chemicals is using Kodak s deep expertise in chemistry and strengths in deposition and coating processes that come from decades of experience in film manufacturing to work on new initiatives: 

o 
 Electric Vehicle EV )/Energy Storage Battery Material Manufacturing - Coating of substrates is a critical aspect of manufacturing materials for batteries and Kodak plans to capitalize on its expertise in coating technology to develop opportunities in this area. Kodak utilizes its pilot coating facility to conduct development of coated electrodes for a variety of battery, fuel cell, and solar film companies as well as low volume manufacturing of electrodes. On July 13, 2022, Kodak invested 25 million to acquire a minority preferred equity interest in Wildcat Discovery Technologies, Inc. Wildcat ), a private technology company that uses proprietary methods to research and develop new battery materials, including an EV battery. Kodak also entered into an agreement to provide coating and engineering services in collaboration with Wildcat to develop and scale film coating technologies. Wildcat has granted Kodak certain rights to negotiate a production or licensing arrangement with Wildcat when and if Wildcat s technology reaches commercial readiness. Kodak has utilized an existing production coating facility to manufacture coated substrates for EV cell assembly. Kodak is evaluating expansion or enhancement of this facility to serve a wider variety of production level customers. 

o 
 Light-Blocking Technology - A proprietary technology initially developed for electrophotographic toners is being leveraged to commercialize a carbon less fabric coating designed to offer superior light management, from complete blackout to selective light filtering, and coating compatibility with an unmatched range of fabrics and also to manage ultraviolet and/or infrared light in addition to visible light. Kodak has installed a production-scale machine to coat fabrics in Eastman Business Park, located in Rochester, NY. 

o 
 Transparent Antennas - Kodak plans to leverage its proprietary copper micro wire technologies and high resolution printing expertise to contract manufacture custom transparent antennas for automotive, commercial construction, and other applications requiring excellent radio frequency RF and optical performance. The integration of antennas is growing worldwide due to the rapid expansion of 5G and an overall increase in RF communications, and the ubiquity of glass surfaces makes transparent antennas attractive for multiple end use markets. Kodak is evaluating this unique printing technology and expertise for transparent heaters to be used in biomedical analytical devices and telecom applications such as satellite dishes. 

o 
 Reagent Manufacturing - Kodak plans to capitalize on its existing chemical manufacturing expertise, including current production of unregulated Key Starting Materials for pharmaceuticals, to implement an expansion into manufacturing Diagnostic Test Reagent solutions. Kodak has started construction of a Current Good Manufacturing Practice cGMP lab and manufacturing facility to manufacture reagents for healthcare applications within an existing building located at Eastman Business Park. Production is scheduled to begin in 2025. 

Film and related component manufacturing operations and Kodak Research Laboratories utilize capacity at Eastman Business Park, which helps cost absorption for both Kodak operations and tenants at Eastman Business Park. 

Kodak plans to capitalize on its intellectual property through new business or licensing opportunities in 3D printing materials, smart material applications, and printed electronics markets.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND OTHER 
 
 Kodak recorded charges of 1 million and 6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in Restructuring costs and other in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 Kodak made cash payments related to restructuring of approximately 2 million and 6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 The restructuring actions implemented in the first nine months of 2024 are expected to generate future annual cash savings of approximately 10 million, which are expected to reduce future annual SG A expenses and Cost of revenues by 5 million each. The majority of the annual savings are expected to be in effect by the end of 2024 as actions are completed. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Management s Assessment of Liquidity 
 Kodak ended the quarter with a cash balance of 214 million, a decrease of 41 million from December 31, 2023. 
 
 The financing transactions entered into during 2023, cash proceeds related to brand licensing arrangements and improvements in cash flow relating to pricing rationalization, cost reductions and operational efficiencies provided additional liquidity to the Company to fund on going operations and obligations, invest in growth opportunities in Kodak s businesses of print and advanced materials and chemicals and for corporate infrastructure investments expected to contribute to improvements in cash flow. 

[39]

Table of Contents 

Available liquidity includes existing cash balances. The amount of available liquidity is subject to fluctuations and includes cash balances held by various entities worldwide. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximately 116 million and 167 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents were held within the U.S. and approximately 98 million and 88 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S. Cash balances held outside the U.S. are generally required to support local country operations and may have high tax costs or other limitations that delay the ability to repatriate, and therefore may not be readily available for transfer to other jurisdictions. Kodak utilizes cash balances outside the U.S. to fund needs in the U.S. through the use of inter-company loans. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, outstanding inter-company loans to the U.S. were 463 million and 460 million, respectively, which include short-term inter-company loans from Kodak s international finance center of 188 million and 173 million, respectively . In China, where approximately 36 million and 29 million of cash and cash equivalents was held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, there are limitations related to net asset balances that may impact the ability to make cash available to other jurisdictions in the world. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Company is permitted to invest up to 60 million (or 75 million after the Deleveraging Milestone Date) in Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Loan Parties and in joint ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries that are not party to the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Company s Hong Kong subsidiary has an inter-company loan from one of the Company s Chinese subsidiaries with a maturity date of November 16, 2024, the proceeds of which were in turn loaned to the Company. The inter-company loan terms provide for it to be repaid over two years in four equal 20 million installments, the first of which was due by November 16, 2023 with the remaining installments due in 2024. The Company paid 2 million in the first quarter of 2024 and 10 million in the second quarter of 2024 towards the first 20 million installment. The outstanding amount of the intercompany loan as of September 30, 2024 was 68 million. The Company is evaluating alternatives for the remaining installments which would allow Kodak and its subsidiaries to perform their obligations to each other while minimizing the impact on U.S. liquidity taking into account requirements imposed by Chinese regulators. Any amounts repaid to the Chinese subsidiary may not be able to be loaned, repatriated or otherwise moved back to the U.S., in which case the Company s U.S. liquidity would be reduced. If the inter-company loan is not extended, refinanced or amended and the Hong Kong subsidiary does not pay any of the individual installments by the end of the 30-day grace period following notice by the Chinese subsidiary after a failure to pay on the due date of such installment, the Hong Kong subsidiary would default on the inter-company loan. The Chinese subsidiary has not issued notice to the Hong Kong subsidiary based on the failure to make any installment payment that has come due. 
 
 Kodak's cash flows continue to be negatively impacted by higher manufacturing costs due to volume declines and increased labor, material and distribution costs, supply chain disruptions and shortages in materials and labor. The impacts from price increases, continued cost reduction actions and supply chain-related cost improvements continue to positively impact Kodak s operations. The economic uncertainties surrounding the current inflationary environment and other global events represent additional elements of complexity in Kodak s plans to return to sustainable positive cash flow. The Company cannot predict the duration and scope of such events, including the war in Ukraine and the conflicts involving Israel, and other factors such as the ability to continue to secure raw materials and components, the impact of rising costs of labor, commodity and distribution costs, the ability to maintain current pricing levels or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume . 
 
 During the third quarter of 2023, Kodak entered into multiple long-term brand licensing arrangements and recorded total deferred revenue of approximately 57 million. Kodak received approximately 12 million of cash proceeds related to these licensing arrangements in 2023, 40 million in the first quarter of 2024 and expects to receive 5 million in 2025. 
 
 Kodak's plans to return to sustainable positive cash flow include generating profitable revenues through pricing actions and customer-focused initiatives, implementing effective working capital utilization, reducing operating expenses, continuing to simplify the organizational structure, investing in information technology systems to drive operational efficiencies, generating cash from selling and leasing underutilized assets or through new licensing opportunities and implementing ways to reduce cash collateral needs. 
 Kodak believes its liquidity position is adequate to fund its operating and investing needs and to provide the flexibility to respond as necessary to ordinary changes in the business and economic environment. Kodak s ability to adequately fund its long term liquidity, debt servicing and capital requirements will be dependent on generating positive cash flows from operations, managing world wide cash through intercompany loans, distributions or other mechanisms, and the ability to convert, redeem or extend the existing Series B and Series C Preferred Stock past their current maturities of May 26, 2026. To the extent the Series B or Series C Preferred

Stock maturity date is not extended and the shares remain outstanding, then the maturity date of the Term Loans under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement will be accelerated from August 15, 2028 to February 25, 2026. In addition, the maturity date of the Amended and Restated Letter of Credit Facility Agreement would be accelerated to 90 days prior to this date. 
 
 Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company prepaid 17 million of the Term Loans with net proceeds from the sale of Target Non-Core Assets (as defined in the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement). 
 
 Letter of Credit Facility Agreement Approximately 27 million and 31 million of letters of credit were issued under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The letters of credit under the Amended and Restated L/C Facility Agreement are collateralized by cash collateral (the L/C Cash Collateral ). The L/C Cash Collateral was 29 million and 32 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, which was classified as Restricted Cash.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash from operating activities declined 32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the corresponding period in 2023 reflecting a decline in proceeds from insurance reimbursements 17 million) and a refund from a governmental authority 9 million), both received in the prior year period, a decrease in liabilities excluding borrowings and trade payables and increased investment in inventory partially offset by a decrease in trade receivables primarily due to 40 million of cash proceeds related to brand licensing received in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7 million compared to the corresponding period in 2023 due to an increase in additions to properties 24 million) partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets 17 million). 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 108 million compared to the corresponding period in 2023 driven by the net proceeds of 90 million received in the third quarter of 2023 from the July 21, 2023 financing transactions and the 17 million Amended and Restated Term Loan prepayment in the three months ending March 31, 2024.

Other Uses of Cash Related to Financing Transactions 
 The holders of the Term Loans are entitled to quarterly cash interest payments at a rate of 7.5 per annum and holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative dividends payable quarterly in cash at a rate of 4.0 per annum. All interest and dividends have been paid when due. 
 
 Other Collateral Requirements 
 The NYS WCB requires security deposits related to self-insured workers compensation obligations, which security deposits are recalculated annually. Due to changes in 2019 to the manner in which the required security deposit is determined, the Company has been required to post additional collateral over the last several years. At December 31, 2022, the Company posted 75.0 million of collateral, representing 107 of the Company s undiscounted actuarial workers compensation obligations. Effective May 1, 2023, the Company added New York to its existing workers compensation liability insurance policy and is no longer self-insured for future claims. As a result, the NYS WCB confirmed the Company will no longer be obligated to post any additional collateral. Further, the NYS WCB confirmed the Company can request a review of the security deposits supporting the historical liability beginning on July 1, 2025 with the submission of a current actuarial report. Based on the results of the actuarial valuation report, the required security deposits may be eligible for reduction in future periods. 
 
 Based on the legacy nature of the Company s workers compensation obligations, the undiscounted actuarial obligation has been declining and the Company expects this trend to continue. While it may not be indicative of the rate of future declines, the undiscounted actuarial liability declined by an average of 5.3 million per year between 2014 and 2023. Accordingly, subject to the possibility of other changes to the calculation of required security deposits by the NYS WCB, the Company expects the amount of the required security deposits to decline over time and the gradual return of the security deposits that have been made or the capital used to support such security deposits. 
 
 As a result of the Company s credit ratings, during the second quarter of 2020 two surety bond holders notified the Company they required approximately 9 million of incremental collateral. The Company reduced the surety bond value by approximately 9 million in July 2020 with an equivalent increase to an existing letter of credit with the NYS WCB. In the third quarter of 2023 the Company deposited 68 million directly with the NYS WCB and cancelled the corresponding letter of credit supporting the associated liability. The Company could be required to provide up to 13 million of letters of credit to the issuers of certain surety bonds in the future to fully collateralize the bonds. 
 
 Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans 
 Kodak made net contributions (funded plans) or paid benefits (unfunded plans) totaling approximately 12 million to its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans in the first nine months of 2024. For the balance of 2024, the forecasted contribution (funded plans) and benefit payment (unfunded plans) requirements for its pension and postretirement plans are approximately 3 million. 
 
 Kodak, in conjunction with the Kodak Retirement Income Plan Committee KRIP Committee ), continues to implement various actions to preserve and maximize the value of KRIP s over-funding by reducing investment risk and improving the overall liquidity of KRIP. During the first quarter of 2024, the KRIP Committee outsourced the investment management of the plan to NEPC, LLC. Effective April 1, 2024, the KRIP Committee approved an updated investment policy that modified the target asset allocations by allocating a greater portion of KRIP s assets to lower risk investments as well as interest rate hedging investments which aim to manage the liability interest rate risk associated with KRIP. As contemplated by the updated investment policy, NEPC subsequently initiated the redemption of a substantial majority of KRIP s hedge fund investments and expanded its interest rate hedging strategy with a portion of those proceeds. During the second quarter of 2024, NEPC engaged a third-party broker to explore strategic options, including the potential secondary sale of KRIP s private equity and certain other illiquid investments. During the third quarter of 2024, the third-party broker initiated a secondary sale process for KRIP s private equity and certain other illiquid investments. Kodak and the KRIP Committee are currently in the process of analyzing the bids received from potential buyers. 
 
 There can be no assurances that KRIP will enter into any sale transaction or that Kodak will receive excess assets from KRIP or concerning the timing or amount of any such receipt. All liabilities of KRIP must be satisfied before any excess assets revert to Kodak, and any amounts that ultimately revert to Kodak will depend on the amount of KRIP s liabilities and the future investment performance and value of its assets. Also, any amount received will be subject to material excise tax and other obligations. To the extent Kodak receives net proceeds from excess KRIP assets, Kodak must use such proceeds to pay down the Term Loans to defined levels pursuant to the Plan Reversion Proceeds provisions of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement before such proceeds would be available for other purposes.

Capital Expenditures 
 Cash flow from investing activities included 39 million of capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Kodak expects approximately 50 million to 60 million of total capital expenditures for 2024. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Preparation of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The accounting policies most critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and that require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in the Company's critical accounting policies or estimates since December 31, 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As noted in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ), Kodak operates and conducts business in many foreign countries and as a result is exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Volatility in the global financial markets could increase the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates which would, in turn, impact sales and net income. For a discussion of the Company's exposure to market risk and how market risk is mitigated, refer to Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" and Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk", contained in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Kodak maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Kodak s reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including Kodak s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Kodak s management, with the participation of Kodak s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of Kodak s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Kodak s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Kodak is in the process of a multi-year project to modernize and enhance the Company s global information technology systems, to improve and standardize business and financial processes and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of financial planning and reporting. As the phased implementation occurs, it may result in changes to processes and procedures which may result in changes to internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, Kodak evaluates whether they materially affect the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 There have been no changes in Kodak s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Kodak s internal control over financial reporting.
