 Key Business Metrics We review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and business plans, and make strategic decisions. Active Subscriptions We define Active Subscriptions as Subscriptions that are paid in full, as well as those for which we expect payment for renewal. We use Active Subscriptions to assess the adoption of our subscription offerings, which is a key factor in assessing our penetration of the market in which we operate and a key driver of revenue. Members can have one or more Active Subscriptions. The following table shows our approximate total number of Active Subscriptions as of September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

September 30, 2024 2023 Legacy 6,900 8,300 Pass 1,700 2,700 Club 3,800 3,500 Total Active Subscriptions 12,400 14,500 Inspirato Legacy Legacy Subscriptions, an offering we no longer sell, had substantial initiation fees and have annual dues that were lower than annualized dues for Club Subscriptions. Club and Pass Subscriptions are available through monthly, semi-annual, annual, and multi-year contracts. Invited Subscriptions are available through ten-year contracts and are included as part of Club subscriptions above given the limited number of sales as the program was launched in June of 2024. The majority of our Subscriptions are annual or multi-year contracts. Subscription revenue is comprised of initiation fees and recurring dues, net of discounts and travel incentives provided to members. We typically bill upfront for Club and Pass Subscriptions and Subscription payments are non-refundable. Our Subscription agreements typically auto-renew after the initial term. Our agreements are generally cancellable by providing 30 days notice. Amounts that have been billed are initially recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized. Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term, generally beginning on the date that our platform is made available to a member. Invited Subscription revenue is amortized over the ten-year contract period. Our Subscription revenue and operating results are impacted by our ability to attract and maintain members. Average Daily Rates and Total Occupancy Average daily rate ADR is defined as the total paid travel revenue, divided by total paid nights in leased residences or hotel rooms and suites. ADR does not include Pass nights utilized. Occupancy is defined as all paid, Pass , Inspirato for Good IFG , Inspirato for Business IFB , employee and complimentary nights in all at-risk properties divided by the total number of at-risk nights available. Net-rate hotel partners are excluded from Hotel Occupancy as these are dependent on the hotel having capacity for Inspirato requests. We monitor (i) paid nights delivered, (ii) ADR and (iii) Occupancy for our residences and leased hotels as we bear the financial responsibility in these properties and can more closely control both the nightly rates and costs as compared to our net-rate hotel partners. Average rates at our hotel partners are typically lower than our residences, as our residences are typically larger and accommodate more guests than hotel rooms and suites.

 The combination of ADR and Occupancy provides us insights regarding how effectively we are utilizing our at-risk properties. Below we have summarized our travel operating statistics:

(2) Excludes net-rate hotel nights as we purchase individual nights but do not have a total number of nights obligation. Travel revenue is generally recognized when travel occurs. Amounts that have been billed are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized when travel occurs. We derive our travel revenue by charging a nightly rate for stays at our portfolio of residences and hotels. For residence and hotel stays, a service charge is also included. Travel revenue also includes amounts collected from fees when a trip is cancelled. A portion of travel revenue comes from customers who do not have paid Subscriptions; these customers receive trial Subscriptions and are primarily from IFG and IFB or are customers who are under promotions with partners. We also earn revenue from Inspirato Only experiences and Bespoke trips. Our travel revenue and operating results are impacted by the number of trips that we are able to deliver to our members as well as the rates we charge for stays. Our revenue management team establishes nightly rates to optimize desired occupancy and revenue. Other Factors Affecting Our Performance and Trends and Uncertainties We believe that the growth and future success of our business depend on many factors, including those from the Key Business Metrics discussed above. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we have to successfully address in order to continue to grow our business and further improve our results of operations. Seasonality Our travel revenues are seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns of travelers over the course of the calendar year. In a typical year, the first, third, and fourth quarters have higher travel revenues than the second quarter. Our Subscription services are seasonal to the extent that interest from potential new members tends to also follow travel revenue. However, subscription revenues from existing members are not impacted by seasonality.

 Travel revenue decreased 6.5 million from 49.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 42.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in travel revenue is primarily driven by an 11 decrease in paid nights delivered due to fewer members resulting in a decrease of 5.6 million partially offset by an 11 increase in the ADR recognized for those paid nights resulting in an increase of 3.3 million to travel revenue. Further declines in revenue were caused by a 2.6 million decrease in revenue from IFG and IFB as well as a decrease of 1.6 million for deferrals from the Inspirato Rewards Rewards program that was launched in August of 2023. Subscription revenue decreased 10.3 million from 33.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily due to a 14 decrease in the number of subscriptions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a 3.4 million decrease to subscription revenue as well as a 5.8 million decrease from a decline in the revenue recognized per subscription due to the decline in Pass subscriptions. Additionally, subscription revenue further declined by 1.2 million for deferrals from the Rewards program that was launched in August of 2023. Rewards and other revenue increased 3.4 million from 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily the result of estimated usage related to Rewards , our member loyalty program, which was launched in August of 2023. Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased 8.1 million from 57.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 49.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 14 . The decrease is primarily a result of decreases in lease costs of 5.6 million, decreases in booking fees of 1.7 million driven by fewer bookings, and a net decrease of 0.5 million in employee costs in cost of revenue. Additionally, cost of revenue further declined by 0.4 million from lower property management, resort and housekeeping fees. Asset impairments and (gain) on lease termination. Asset impairments and gain on lease termination consisted of asset impairments of 4.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a gain on lease termination of 29.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we identified 5 leases for which the right-of-use assets and related property and equipment had net carrying values that exceeded their estimated fair value as determined by their estimated discounted future cash flows. Most of these leases were related to one group of underperforming properties in a single geographic location. Based on this information, we recorded right-of-use asset impairments of 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into the Termination Agreement for certain previously impaired, underperforming leases that resulted in a decrease to our right-of-use assets of 4.6 million and a decrease to our operating lease liabilities of 41.7 million, resulting in a gain on lease termination of 37.1 million. The gain was partially offset by the termination fee of 6.6 million as well as the payment of 0.6 million to One Planet Group for the guarantee. No asset impairments were identified for the three months ended September 30, 2024. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 1.9 million from 21.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 9 . The decrease is primarily a result of a net decrease of 4.6 million in corporate costs and a decrease of 3.7 million due to lower headcount from the reductions in force that took place during 2023 and in August of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 3.4 million due to higher equity-based compensation expense, 1.9 million from other non-recurring professional fees not incurred during 2023 and 1.1 million from increased cloud software amortization. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 2.2 million from 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 23 . The decrease is primarily a result of lower employee compensation of 1.9 million due to the reduction in force in August of 2024 as well as decreases for employee costs between periods. Sales and marketing further decreased 0.3 million from net decreases in spending on software purchases and license fees, online advertising and events. Operations. Operations expenses decreased 4.1 million from 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 44 , primarily due to a net decrease of 2.4 million from lower spend due to decreases in the number of residences and other cost savings initiatives and a decrease of 1.6 million due to the reduction in force in August of 2024.

 Technology and development. Technology and development expenses decreased 1.0 million from 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 35 , primarily due to the reductions in force that took place during 2023 and in August of 2024. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to stabilized capital spend that serves to replace long-lived assets as they come to the end of their useful lives. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net decreased 1.3 million from 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 74 . We incurred interest expense on the Note of 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to debt issuance costs and interest expense of 2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The interest expense was offset by interest income from our banking relationship of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Loss (gain) on fair value instruments. Losses and gains on fair value instruments changed from a gain of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to a loss of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Public Warrant fair value gains decreased 0.3 million from a gain of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to a loss of less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value loss recognized on the Note was 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to changes in discount rates. The Note was issued on September 29, 2023. Restructuring charges. Restructuring charges were 7.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to no restructuring charges during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily a result of 4.4 million acceleration of equity-based compensation expense and 2.6 million cash restructuring charges that were incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other expense, net . Other expense, net remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased 0.3 million from 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower amounts owed to state and foreign taxing authorities.

 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Revenue. Total revenue decreased 41.6 million from 258.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 216.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 16 .

 Travel revenue decreased 21.1 million from 152.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 131.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in travel revenue is primarily driven by a 10 decrease in paid nights delivered due to fewer members resulting in a decrease of 15.7 million while ADR recognized for those paid nights remained flat. Travel revenue further decreased 5.1 million for the Rewards program travel allocation as the Rewards program was not launched until the third quarter of 2023 and, therefore, deferrals for travel revenue were not incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Further declines in travel revenue were caused by net decreases in service fee revenue, cancel fee revenue, partner commission revenue and other travel revenue of 3.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 3.3 million in revenue from IFG and IFB. Subscription revenue decreased 29.6 million from 105.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 76.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily due to a 14 decrease in the number of subscriptions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a 15.3 million decrease to subscription revenue as well as a 10.7 million decrease from a decline in the revenue recognized per subscription due primarily to the decline in Pass subscriptions. Additionally, subscription revenue further declined by 3.6 million for deferrals for the Rewards program that was launched in August of 2023. Rewards and other revenue increased 9.1 million from 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily the result of estimated usage related to Rewards , our member loyalty program, which was launched in August of 2023. Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased 33.2 million from 182.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 149.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 18 . The decrease is primarily a result of decreases in booking fees of 15.8 million driven by fewer bookings, decreases in lease costs of 12.4 million, decreases of 2.5 million from lower property management, resort and housekeeping fees and net decreases of 2.5 million from the transition of certain employees from cost of revenue to operations after June 30, 2023. Asset impairments (gain) on lease termination. Asset impairments and gain on lease termination consisted of asset impairments of 34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a gain on lease termination of 29.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we identified 38 leases for which the right-of-use assets and related property and equipment had net carrying values that exceeded their estimated fair value as determined by their estimated discounted future cash flows. Most of these leases were related to one group of underperforming properties in a single geographic location. Based on this information, we recorded right-of-use asset impairments of 34.3 million and property plant and equipment impairments of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into the Termination Agreement for certain previously impaired, underperforming leases that resulted in a decrease to our right-of-use assets of 4.6 million and a decrease to our operating lease liabilities of 41.7 million, resulting in a gain on lease termination of 37.1 million. The gain was partially offset by the termination fee of 6.6 million as well as the payment of 0.6 million to One Planet Group for the guarantee. No asset impairments were identified for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 7.8 million from 56.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 48.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 14 . The decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in payroll-related expenses of 7.0 million due to lower headcount from the reductions in force that took place during 2023 and in August of 2024 as well as a decrease of 6.8 million from lower corporate costs. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 3.0 million due to higher equity-based compensation expense, 1.1 million from increased cloud software amortization and an increase of 1.9 million from other non-recurring professional fees not incurred during 2023. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased 0.3 million from 24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1 . The increase is primarily a result of higher employee compensation of 0.6 million due to the transition of certain employees from operations to sales and marketing during 2023 as well as increases in employee costs between periods . The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 0.3 million from decreases in spending on software purchases and license fees, online advertising and events. Operations. Operations expenses decreased 7.5 million from 24.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 31 , primarily due to a decrease of 4.0 million from the net transition of certain employees from cost of revenue into operations and from operations to sales and marketing and a net decrease of 3.5 million from lower spend due to decreases in events expense, mileage and meals and other cost savings initiatives.

 Technology and development. Technology and development expenses decreased 3.3 million from 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 35 , primarily due to the reductions in force that took place during 2023 and in August of 2024. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to stabilized capital spend that serves to replace long-lived assets as they come to the end of their useful lives. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We incurred interest expense on the Note of 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to debt issuance costs and interest expense of 2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The interest expense was offset by interest income from our banking relationship of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gain on fair value instruments. Gain on fair value instruments increased 3.1 million from 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 577 . Public Warrant fair value gains decreased 0.6 million from a gain of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to a loss of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value gain recognized on the Note was 3.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to changes in discount rates. The Note was issued on September 29, 2023. Restructuring charges. Restructuring charges were 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to no restructuring charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily a result of 4.4 million acceleration of equity-based compensation expense and 2.6 million cash restructuring charges that were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other (income) expense, net. Other (income) expense, net changed from other expense, net of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to other income, net of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change is primarily due to 0.3 million lower loss on retirement of fixed assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and insurance recoveries of 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that were not received during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense. Income tax expense decreased 0.6 million from 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower amounts owed to state and foreign taxing authorities.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As of September 30, 2024, we had 13.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 10.7 million of restricted cash. Further, as a result of the Reorganization Plan entered into in conjunction with the closing of the One Planet Group Financing, we have engaged in several initiatives that together are expected to result in the following cash savings on an annual basis: We performed a reduction in force on August 12, 2024, which resulted in approximately 15.0 million in annualized cash savings. Additional headcount reductions from the planned elimination of positions as employees departed Inspirato after August 12, 2024 resulted in approximately 3.0 million in additional annualized cash savings. The Termination Agreement resulted in the removal of 57.0 million in future lease payments through 2032 resulting in annualized cash savings of approximately 7.5 million. We have reviewed and negotiated non-critical spend such as professional fees, software and noncritical marketing which has resulted in annualized savings of approximately 10.0 million. We are currently reviewing our lease portfolio to either renegotiate unfavorable leases or to exit unprofitable properties, a process that is expected to yield approximately 7.5 million in annualized savings. 
 Additionally, on October 22, 2024, we entered into the Secondary Investment Agreement with the Secondary Purchasers, to sell approximately 757,576 shares of Class A Common Stock, 0.0001 par value per share, at 3.96 per share, the closing price at October 22, 2024, for an aggregate purchase price of 3.0 million. Further, the Investment Agreement Option can be exercised for an aggregate purchase price of up to 2.5 million any time between November 29, 2024 and December 29, 2024. Together these strategic initiatives through the Reorganization Plan, as well as obtaining additional new capital investments, including, but not limited to, the Secondary Investment Agreement as well as the Investment Agreement Option from the Purchaser to purchase an additional 2.5 million in Class A Shares and Investment Warrants, support our belief that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least the next twelve months. We are operating in an uncertain economic environment, however, and we cannot make assurances that our Reorganization Plan will result in the cash savings we anticipate, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that financing will be available to us and in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our other liquidity needs. If cash generated from our operations is not sufficient or available to meet our liquidity requirements, then we may be required to obtain additional financing in the future. There can be no assurances that equity or debt financing will be available to us if or when we need it or, if available, the terms will be satisfactory to us. Our principal sources of liquidity have historically consisted of cash flow from financing activities as well as operating activities, primarily from revenue related to travel and Subscriptions. On September 29, 2023, we sold and issued the Note for net proceeds of approximately 23.1 million. We are in compliance with all covenants under the Note. For additional information on the Note, refer to Overview Capital One Ventures Investment and Strategic Partnership above. Additionally, on August 12, 2024 we entered into the Investment Agreement, which provided 10.0 million in cash to the business through an equity infusion. For additional information on the Investment Agreement, refer to Overview Investment Agreement above. We have generally maintained a working capital deficit, meaning that our current liabilities exceed our current assets, primarily due to our significant deferred revenue and operating leases. Deferred revenue relates primarily to travel, subscriptions and travel credits purchased, all of which are paid to us in advance but are not yet taken or consumed and accordingly do not represent an obligation to make future cash payments other than to fund trip-related expenses, and to a lesser extent Rewards , which is an accounting allocation to defer a portion of members spend. As of September 30, 2024, deferred revenue included 72.1 million, 63.2 million, 17.8 million and 10.9 million for travel, subscriptions, travel credits and Rewards , respectively. Also, as of

Table of Contents 
 September 30, 2024, our current operating lease liabilities totaled 55.3 million and our noncurrent operating lease liabilities totaled 137.4 million. Our cash needs vary from period to period primarily based on the timing of travel and sales promotions. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of member and revenue growth, travel bookings, change in the number of properties, other initiatives including the success of Rewards and Invited and overall economic conditions. The following table presents summarized information from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands) : 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (22,713) (45,405) Net cash used in investing activities (4,833) (10,731) Net cash provided by financing activities 9,419 25,553 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (18,127) (30,583) Cash Flows Cash flows used in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities decreased from 45.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 22.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This change is primarily driven by a reduction of net loss of 71.5 million, an increase in equity compensation of 6.2 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities including a 5.4 million change in deferred revenue, a 3.8 million change in prepaid member travel, a 1.6 million change to paid-in-kind interest and a 1.5 million change in depreciation and amortization. The change is partially offset by a 64.2 million change from asset impairments to a gain on lease termination and a 3.1 million change in gain on fair value instruments. Cash flows used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased from 10.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change was driven by lower expenditures related to both ongoing internal software development projects of 5.4 million and property and equipment of 0.5 million. Cash flows provided by financing activities. Cash flows from financing activities changed from 25.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily due to proceeds from the 25.0 million Note that was issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the proceeds from the Investment Agreement of 10.0 million during t he nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, further decreases are from a 1.1 million decrease in net proceeds from employee stock compensation activity. Use of Cash and Contractual Obligations We expect to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months through use of our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities. We expect to meet our long-term cash requirements with cash flows from operating and financing activities, including but not limited to potential future issuances of debt or equity. Our primary uses of cash are for operating expenses, lease payments and capital expenditures. Our future commitments consist of obligations under the Note (including principal and coupon interest) and operating leases, primarily for vacation properties and our corporate headquarters. The leases may require us to pay taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance costs. We have been undergoing a lease optimization process to decrease our cash commitments related to operating leases, whereby we have renegotiated certain leases and terminated certain leases, depending on the individual lease situation. See Note 8 Leases in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Future minimum annual commitments under these operating leases as of September 30, 2024 are as follows (in thousands): 

Fiscal Year Ending Operating leases Remainder of 2024 18,574 2025 65,499 2026 45,570 2027 32,555 2028 23,767 2029 and thereafter 54,906 Total minimum lease payments 240,871 As of September 30, 2024, we were party to 10 leases that had not yet commenced. Future payments under these leases were 14.1 million as of September 30, 2024. The 25.0 million Note is an unsubordinated secured obligation of Inspirato. The Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 8 per annum. Interest on the Note is payable quarterly on the last business day of each calendar quarter following the issuance of the Note and is payable at our election in cash or in kind by increasing the outstanding principal amount of the Note by the amount of interest payable on such interest payment date. The Note will mature on September 29, 2028, subject to earlier conversion, redemption or repurchase. Non-GAAP Financial Metrics In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we use Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our Board concerning our business and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of our business over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. There are limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, including that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial measures. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Thus, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. We provide a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBTIDA Margin and Free Cash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with their respective related GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net Loss We define Adjusted Net Loss as net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) less asset impairments and (gain) on lease termination, fair value gains and losses on financial instruments, restructuring charges and other non-recurring professional fees. The above items are excluded from Adjusted Net Loss because our management believes that they are not indicative of our core operating performance and do not reflect the underlying economics of our business.

 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) less interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense, fair value gains and losses on financial instruments, restructuring charges, other non-recurring professional fees and asset impairments and (gain) on lease termination. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue for the same period. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because our management believes that they are not indicative of our core operating performance and do not reflect the underlying economics of our business. The following table represents a reconciliation of our net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), the closest GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands, other than percentages): 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) 6,622 (25,422) (6,522) (77,997) Interest expense, net 454 1,731 1,150 1,204 Income tax expense 151 492 351 909 Depreciation and amortization 3,064 3,321 8,512 7,047 Equity based compensation 7,279 6,686 12,829 11,074 Loss (gain) on fair value instruments 158 (267) (3,675) (543) Restructuring charges 6,985 6,985 Other non-recurring professional fees (1) 1,828 1,828 Asset impairments and (gain) on lease termination (29,895) 4,294 (29,895) 34,348 Adjusted EBITDA (3,354) (9,165) (8,437) (23,958) Adjusted EBITDA Margin (4.9) (11.1) (3.9) (9.3) 
 (1) Included in general and administrative on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 Free Cash Flow We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less development of internal-use software and purchases of property and equipment. We believe that Free Cash Flow is a meaningful indicator of liquidity that provides information to our management and investors about the amount of cash generated from operations, after development of internal-use software and purchases of property and equipment, that can be used for strategic initiatives, if any.

 The following table presents a reconciliation of our net cash used in operating activities, the closest GAAP measure, to Free Cash Flow (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (13,744) (11,721) (22,713) (45,405) Development of internal-use software (172) (2,624) (528) (5,924) Purchase of property and equipment (1,135) (1,223) (4,305) (4,807) Free Cash Flow (15,051) (15,568) (27,546) (56,136) Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements For information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Our principal market risks are our exposure to foreign currency risk and our equity risk. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk, mainly related to non-lease operating expenditures that we incur in foreign countries. Many of our leases, which are the most significant component of operating costs in foreign countries, are denominated in U.S. dollars and thus do not result in foreign currency risk. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating expenditures denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 4.7 million and 18.0 million, respectively, primarily in Mexican Pesos and Euros. A hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Mexican Peso and Euro would have a 0.5 million and 1.8 million impact to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Equity Risk We are exposed to equity risk related to our stock price and overall market capitalization. The fair market value of our stock price could increase or decrease substantially in the near term and could have a material impact to our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations with respect to future stock-based compensation costs and other equity transactions.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedure s. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the Executives ), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management, with the participation of the Executives, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, and as a result of the material weakness described below, the Executives concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to a reasonable assurance level. Nevertheless, based on the performance of additional procedures by management designed to ensure reliability of financial reporting, our management has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses described below, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of the dates, and for each of the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP . Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In response to the material weaknesses identified in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we, with oversight from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, developed a plan to remediate the material weaknesses. Ongoing remediation activities include: Continue to design and implement a comprehensive and continuous risk assessment process to identify and assess financial statement risks and ensure that the financial reporting process and related internal controls are in place to respond to those risks; Continue to enhance the design of and implement additional process-level control activities and ensure they are properly evidenced and operating effectively; and Enhance the training provided to our control operators. 
 We believe the foregoing efforts will effectively remediate the material weaknesses described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Because the reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution, the successful on-going remediation of the material weaknesses will require on-going review and evidence of effectiveness prior to concluding that controls are effective. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As outlined above, we are in the process of taking steps to remediate the material weaknesses. We made no other changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Except as described below, we are not currently a party to any material litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors. Class Action Complaint Relating to Restatement On February 16, 2023, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in the District of Colorado captioned Keith Koch, Individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Inspirato Incorporated, Brent Handler, and R. Webster Neighbor . The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against all defendants, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants. The complaint seeks certification as a class action and an unspecified amount of damages, attorneys' fees, expenses, and other costs. The complaint generally alleges that certain of our prior public statements about our results of operations and financial condition were materially false and misleading because they misrepresented and failed to disclose adverse facts pertaining to the restatement of our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. On July 16, 2024, the magistrate recommended the case be dismissed and the plaintiff filed a motion objecting to these recommendations on July 30, 2024. We responded to these objections and on September 23, 2024, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice. On October 23, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended motion for the Court s review. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except for the following: Resales of our Class A Common Stock in the public market may cause the trading price to fall. Resales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock could depress the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. Such sales could also result in resales of our Class A Common Stock by our other current stockholders, potentially leading to further decreases in the trading price of the Class A Common Stock. There can be no assurance that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq or that will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. On October 28, 2024, we received notice from Nasdaq that we are now compliant with its listing standards. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds . None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities . Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures . Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information . pplicable.
