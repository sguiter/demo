The
transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer
receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be
entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. We issue refunds to retail, e-commerce and print media customers,
upon request, within 30 days of delivery. We estimate the amount of potential refunds at each reporting period using a portfolio approach
of historical data, adjusted for changes in expected customer experience, including seasonality and changes in economic factors. For
retailers, distributors and wholesalers, we do not offer a right of return or refund and revenue is recognized at the time products are
shipped to customers. In all cases, judgment is required in estimating these reserves. Actual claims for returns could be materially
different from the estimates. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, reserves for estimated sales returns totaled and ,
respectively, and are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as accrued expenses. 

We
recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in a contract by transferring control over a product to a customer when product
is shipped based on fulfillment by the Company. The Company considers fulfillment when it passes all liability at the point of shipping
through third party carriers. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing
transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound
freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of
revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.

), based on technical merits, that the position would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
Tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold will be measured using a probability-weighted approach as the largest amount
of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement. Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if
all, or some portion, of such assets will more likely than not be realized. Should they occur, interest and penalties related to tax
positions are recorded as interest expense. such interest or penalties have been incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2024
and 2023. 

The
Company remains subject to income tax examinations from Federal and state taxing jurisdictions for 2020 through 2023. 

and a deficit in working capital of approximately million. Further, at March 31, 2024, the accumulated deficit
amounted to approximately million. We use working capital to finance our ongoing operations, and since those operations do not currently
cover all our operating costs, managing working capital is essential to our Company s future success. Because of this history of
losses and financial condition, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

A
successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon obtaining sufficient financing to fund the Company s
planned expenses and achieving a level of revenue adequate to support the Company s cost structure. Management plans to finance
future operations using cash on hand, increased revenue from RxAir air purification units, Vytex license fees and stock issuances to
new and existing shareholders.. 

There
can be no assurances the Company will be able to achieve projected levels of revenue in 2024 and beyond. If the Company is not able to
achieve projected revenue and obtain alternate additional financing of equity or debt, the Company would need to significantly curtail
or reorient operations during 2024, which could have a material adverse effect on the ability to achieve the business objectives, and
as a result, may require the Company to file bankruptcy or cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts classified as liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be forced to take any such actions. 

The
Company s future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including: the rate at which the Company can introduce RxAir air
purification units and license Vytex NRL raw materials to manufacturers, and subsequently retailers; the costs of filing, prosecuting,
defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; market acceptance of the Company s products,
services and competing technological developments; the Company s ability to successfully acquire new customers and maintain a strong
brand; and broader economic factors such as interest rates and changes in customer spending patterns. As the Company expands its activities
and operations, cash requirements are expected to increase at a rate consistent with revenue growth after the Company has achieved sustained
revenue generation.

leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring
operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate we would incur at lease commencement
to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of the lease. We used incremental borrowing rates
as of the implementation date for operating leases that commenced prior to that date.

t have a derivative liability balance on the condensed consolidated balance
sheet as the liability was considered de minimis. The Company analyzed the conversion features and warrants of the various note agreements
for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15 Derivatives and Hedging and determined that the embedded conversion
features should be classified as a derivative because the exercise price of these Convertible notes are subject to a variable conversion
rate. The Company has determined that the conversion feature is not considered to be solely indexed to the Company s own stock
and is therefore not afforded equity treatment. In accordance with ASC 815, the Company has bifurcated the conversion feature of the
notes and recorded a derivative liability. 

The
embedded derivatives for the notes are carried on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The derivative
liability is marked-to-market each measurement period and any unrealized change in fair value is recorded as a component of the condensed
consolidated statement of operations and the associated fair value carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet is adjusted by the
change.

The
Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of option and warrant awards: 

Expected
 Dividend Yield - because the Company does not currently pay dividends, the expected dividend yield is ; 

Expected
 Volatility in Stock Price - volatility based on the Company s trading activity was used to determine expected volatility; 

Risk-free
 Interest Rate - reflects the average rate on a United States Treasury Bond with a maturity equal to the expected term of the option;
 and 

Expected
 Life of Award - because we have minimal experience with the exercise of options or warrants for use in determining the expected life
 of each award, we used the option or warrant s contractual term as the expected life. 

For
the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there were share-based compensation expense related to employee and Board Members 
stock options. There is no unrecognized compensation expense as of March 31, 2024 for non-vested share-based awards to be recognized

EMA
Financial 

On
February 19, 2019, EMA Financial, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against the Company. The lawsuit alleged
various breaches of an underlying convertible promissory note and stock purchase agreement and sought four claims for relief: (i) specific
performance to enforce a stock conversion and contractual obligations; (ii) breach of contract; (iii) permanent injunction to enforce
the stock conversion and contractual obligations; and (iv) legal fees and costs of the litigation. The complaint was filed with a motion
seeking: (i) a preliminary injunction seeking an immediate resolution of the case through the stock conversion; (ii) a consolidation
of the trial with the preliminary injunctive hearing; and (iii) summary judgment on the first and third claims for relief. 

The
Company filed an opposition to the motion and upon oral argument the motion for injunctive relief was denied. The Court issued a decision
permitting a motion for summary judgment to proceed and permitted the Company the opportunity to supplement its opposition papers together
with the plaintiff who was also provided opportunity to submit reply papers. On April 5, 2019, the Company filed the opposition papers
as well as a motion to dismiss the first and third causes of action in the complaint. On March 13, 2020, the Court granted the Company s
motion dismissing the first and third claims for relief and denied the motion for summary judgment as moot. 

The
Company subsequently filed an amended answer with counterclaims. The affirmative defenses if granted collectively preclude the relief
sought. In addition, Vystar filed counterclaims asserting: (a) violation of 10(b)(5) of the Securities and Exchange Act; (b) violation
of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act (failure to register as a broker-dealer); (c) pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act,
28 U.S.C. 2201, the Company requests the Court to declare: (i) pursuant to Delaware law, the underlying agreements are unconscionable;
(ii) the underlying agreements are unenforceable and/or portions are unenforceable, such as the liquidated damages sections; (iii) to
the extent the agreement is enforceable, Vystar in good faith requests the Court to declare the legal fee provisions of the agreements
be mutual (d) unjust enrichment; (e) breach of contract (in the alternative); and (f) attorneys fees. 

On
June 10, 2020, EMA filed a motion for summary judgment as to its remaining claims for relief and a motion to dismiss the Company s
affirmative defenses and counterclaims. The Company opposed the motion on July 10, 2020, and the same was fully submitted to the Court
on July 28, 2020. On March 29, 2021, the Court issued a decision granting in part and denying in part the motion. Specifically, the Court
granted that part of the motion seeking summary judgment and dismissal on the Company s affirmative defense and counterclaim regarding
Sections 15(a)/29(b) of the Exchange Act. Two weeks later the Company filed a motion for reconsideration as to the dismissal portion
of the order, or, for the alternative, a motion for certification for the right to file a petition to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals
on the issue. The Court denied the motion for reconsideration and certification. Subsequently, fact discovery has been completed and
on June 24, 2022 both parties submitted competing motions for summary judgment. 

EMA
seeks summary judgment on its breach of contract and attorneys fees claims, specifically seeking damages in the amount of 
with interest premised on the argument it was entitled to effectuate a January 15 and February 5, 2019, notices of conversions. EMA
further seeks to dismiss Vystar s affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Conversely, Vystar filed its motion for summary judgment
seeking an order to dismiss the EMA complaint on the grounds: (i) the underlying note was satisfied on December 11, 2018; and (ii) EMA,
through multiple breaches of the note, over-converted the note by shares equating to a request of damages against EMA and
in favor of Vystar for , with interest accruing at , and attorneys fees. The briefing by the parties was fully submitted
on July 29, 2022. 

On
January 6, 2023, the Court issued a series of preliminary rulings based upon the parties respective summary judgment motions.
Those rulings narrowed the outstanding issues (and claims) to only the parties breach of contract claim and counterclaim (and
affirmative defenses) regarding the conversion process. Of particular importance, the Court found EMA breached the note by failing to
effectuate the conversions in the manner outlined by the controlling note. The Court further found the principal balance at issue was
 , interest accrued from the date set in the note and default interest, to the extent applicable, was to accrue at the default
rate from September 2018, forward. The Court left undecided whether EMA s breach of the note was material, whether affirmative
defenses as previously raised by the parties were applicable to each parties contractual claim, and a damages analysis associated
with the same. The Court then requested a supplemental briefing as to the issues of materiality, liability and damages. The issues were
fully briefed and submitted on February 24 and March 15, 2023. 

On
October 27, 2023, the Court held oral argument on the issues addressed in the supplemental briefing. On November 27, 2023, the Court
issued its order resolving the case in Vystar s favor. The Court held while EMA breached the terms of the underlying promissory
note by virtue of the manner of its conversions, such breach was not material. The Court thereafter held the balance of the note was
paid in full by Vystar. Based upon the decision in favor of Vystar, the Court granted Vystar s request for legal fees, and requested
a briefing on the same. Vystar subsequently submitted a motion for legal and expert fees in the amount of approximately supported
by the relevant paperwork. The parties await the Court s decision. 

On
December 24, 2023, EMA filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing the Court failed to properly read the underlying note that, in EMA s
belief, allowed it to effectuate the two post default conversions at issue in the case. After the matter was fully briefed by the parties,
on May 16, 2024, the Court held oral argument. On the same date after argument the Court granted EMA the procedural right for reconsideration,
and thereafter denied the substantive portion of its motion. The November 27, 2023, decision stands. 

On
December 27, 2023, EMA filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeal targets each
section of the prior decisions that fell against EMA. Vystar has until June 14, 2024, to file its notice of appeal with the same appellate
court. The appeal, if filed, will target the relevant and material decisions issued by the Court against Vystar. 

On
June 13, 2024, Vystar has timely filed its notice of cross-appeal. 

On
August 5, 2024, the District Court denied, without prejudice to renew, the motion for attorneys fees, ruling that such is premature
based upon the pending appeal and cross-appeal. 

On
September 20, 2024, EMA filed its submissions, and Vystar thereafter has requested ninety-one days to file its opposition and cross-appeal.
Thereafter the parties will submit final submissions for the appellate court to consider.

About
Vytex 

Vytex
is a multi-patented latex raw material in which the allergy causing proteins are reduced to a level that falls at or below detection
based on ASTM approved test methods. Vytex has been available as a raw material commercially for fourteen years and through that time
has a group of manufacturers who use it in end products such as electrical gloves, condoms, adhesives, etc. Ironically, most use Vytex
as it s better for their manufacturing process as an easier to use raw material and not for protein properties. As of mid-2020
Vystar and the Indian Rubber Manufacturers Research Association s IRMRA had been actively collaborating to develop
viscoelastic deproteinized natural rubber (DPNR) variants having properties for expanding applications in specific new arenas such as
green tires, biodegradable and other unique bioelastoplast product lines that desire a new approach. Additionally, this research, while
slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, showed attributes with extra low ammonia offerings that are desired. 

Towards
the end of 2020, Vystar entered into a Market Development and Distribution Agreement with Corrie MacColl, Ltd. CMC Global to produce, develop and manage the Vytex product and supply lines. This agreement allows Vystar to expand the market for its Natural
Rubber Latex products and has garnered much attention across a broad range of industries including liquid Vytex as well as the newly
developed dry rubber Vytex. As of the date of this report, CMC Global has provided numerous opportunities that are in a trial basis or
moving towards manufacturing trials in industries that use a significant amount of natural rubber latex, hence Vytex that now includes
production size trial runs in a large dipped product consumer line starting late 2022. Additionally Vystar now has a testing supply of
Vytex dry rubber for larger trials. The success of early trials and the shipping crisis has led to broader spectrum of manufacturers
combining the potential of Cameroon production with strategically placed contract manufacturers based on geographical needs including
the North American maket. Also Vystar research has shown great strides in specializing liquid Vytex (ultra low protein latex, ULPL) to
meet the immediate needs of customers such as low or no nitrosamine and others (discussed in the presentation below available in the
pdf) and additional patents have been proposed to cover these findings. Research into dry rubber continues at a moderate pace as tire
companies seek out alternatives to synthetics. 

In
Halcyon Agri (owner of CMC Global), 2020 Corporate Report: Our group-wide innovation capabilities have enabled us to engage in
innovative commercial partnerships. Corrie MacColl is collaborating with Vystar to transform our Cameroon plantation output into ultra-pure
latex with stronger molecular bond that offers enhanced strength, durability, and flexibility in the end products. This is achieved by
removing non-rubber components and 99.85 of the proteins. CMC Global continues to work with the facility at Cameroon to produce
Vytex at their owned processing plant. 

Vytex
researcher Dr. Ranjit Matthan and CMC Global Director John Heath presented at The International Latex Conference which was held virtually
July 20 to 22, 2021 and offered a plenary session entitled Innovations and Sustainability in Natural Rubber Latex - The New Paradigm. 
The presentation discussed the dramatic effect the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the natural rubber supply chain, and how the industry
is reacting the new economic circumstances; including strategy and policy shifts in supply chain management and restoring greater geographic
diversification of latex processing and product manufacturing. The R D association with IRMRA promises quicker laboratory and field-based
testing and evaluations downstream. At Vystar, the recalibrated sustainability programme (FSC, nitrosamines ammonia free, ultralow
proteins, no SVHC and green carbon neutrality) emphasize certifications with Corrie MacColl market reach facilitating faster rollouts.
Nontraditional/non Hevea brasiliensis based production efforts are likely to continue to face new penetration and high cost-benefit
acceptance challenges in this decade. A PDF of the full presentation is available on vytex.com.

Additionally,
in August 2021, Dr. Matthan presented new data to the Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association including Vytex dry rubber. 

Vystar
has expanded Vytex into the consumer arena with an introduction into the bedding category, aligning with key foam manufacturers to create
mattresses, mattress toppers and pillows. Through this effort, Vystar can bring the benefits of great sleep and a more natural product
to the public. 

About
FEC 

Vystar
is looking to Fluid Energy as it moves forward in its quest for a cleaner and safer environment. The Company is planning to improve its
air purifying by using the ultrasonic technology of Fluid Energy and combining it with its leading UV-C technology. The designs and prototypes
are in development. This ultrasonic technology is applied into water products with the same goal. We have working prototypes for our
water product targets that have tested beyond expectation for bacterial killing and flow metering. We will begin soon evaluating our
ability to eradicate hard water pollution that fouls pools, fountains, and pumps. These products will move us toward living more safely
and cleanly in our environment.

Revenues 

Revenues
for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were 37,607and 409,907, respectively, for a decrease of 372,300 or 90.8 . The decrease
in revenues was due to the Company s internal reorganization. Jamie Rotman took over as CEO to refocus the Company on Vystar s
two main product lines, RxAir and Vytex. Her focus in the first quarter was additionally to complete the move-out of the Rotmans 250,000
sq ft facility and relocate the inventory. Another one of her objectives was to bring the internal reporting systems up to date including
procedures to make future reporting and external audits run smoothly. 

The
Company reported gross profit of 20,187 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 compared to gross profit of 333,209 for the
three-month period ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of 313,022 or 93.9 . The decrease in gross profit is consistent with the decrease
in revenues. 

The
cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was 17,420 and 76,698, respectively, a decrease of 59,278 or 77.3 . 

Operating
Expenses 

The
Company s operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and support costs for management and administrative staff, and for
other general and administrative costs, including professional fees related to accounting, finance, and legal services as well as advertising
and other operating expenses. The Company s operating expenses were 357,425 and 383,926 for the three months ended March 31,
2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 26,501 or 6.9 . The decrease was due in part to reduced revenues. 

Other
Expense 

Other
expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of interest expense of 8,089 and 10,337, respectively. 

Discontinued
Operations 

Loss
from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was 29,391 and 1,216,022, respectively, for a decrease
of 1,186,631 or 97.6 . The decrease was attributable to the final winding down of expenses in 2024. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss was 374,718 and 1,277,076 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 902,358 or 70.7 . Net
loss in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 versus net loss in the same period in 2023 decreased due to a significantly reduced loss from
discontinued operations. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The
Company s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.
However, we have incurred significant losses and experienced negative cash flow since inception. At March 31, 2024, the Company had cash
of 11,768 and a deficit in working capital of approximately 6 million. Further, at March 31, 2024, the accumulated deficit amounted
to approximately 61 million. We use working capital to finance our ongoing operations, and since those operations do not currently cover
all of our operating costs, managing working capital is essential to our Company s future success. Because of this history of losses
and financial condition, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

A
successful transition to profitable operations is dependent upon obtaining sufficient financing to fund the Company s planned expenses
and achieving a level of revenue adequate to support the Company s cost structure. 

Management
plans to finance future operations using cash on hand, as well as increased revenue from RxAir air purifier sales and Vytex license fees.
The Company will also raise capital with common stock subscription issuances. 

There
can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve projected levels of revenue in 2024 and beyond. If we are not able to achieve projected
revenue and obtain alternate additional financing of equity or debt, we would need to significantly curtail or reorient operations during
2024, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives, and as a result, may require the
Company to file bankruptcy or cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts classified as liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be forced
to take any such actions. 

35 

Our
future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including: the rate at which we can introduce RxAir products and license Vytex NRL
raw material and the foam cores made from Vytex to manufacturers and subsequently retailers; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending
and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, along with market acceptance of our products, and services and
competing technological developments. As we expand our activities and operations, our cash requirements are expected to increase at a
rate consistent with revenue growth after we achieve sustained revenue generation. 

Sources
and Uses of Cash 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 100,757 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to net cash provided by operating
activities of 345,228 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash used in operations
was primarily due to the net loss offset non-cash related add-back of share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization. 

The
Company had cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of 1,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024.
There were no investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 74,365 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to cash used in of 197,749
during the three months ended March 31, 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash was provided by related party advances
of 12,379 and discontinued operations of 61,986. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, cash was provided by related party advances
of 29,855 and used in discontinued operations in the amount of 227,604. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that may be reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, liquidity, or results of operations. 

DISCLOSURE
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Our
Management s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking
(within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking
statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general
economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; product development, introduction
and acceptance; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity;
competition; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business
disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be
detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Although
the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be
based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks
and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking
statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports
as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations and prospects.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

The
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officer is responsible for establishing
and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company. Although the Certifying Officer has designed such disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that material information is made known to them, particularly during the period in which this report was prepared,
certain material weaknesses occurred during the period ended March 31, 2024 and subsequent to period end. The Certifying Officer has
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) (the Rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or Exchange Act as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report and is working on improving controls with an outside CPA firm and internal resources.

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d - 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Internal control over financial reporting is a process
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; (iii) provide
reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and (iv) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance that the controls will prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, the design of any control system is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control
systems, there is only the reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions. 

Management,
under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our acting Chief Financial Officer, conducted an
evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 2013. Based on our evaluation
under the COSO framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2024.
Such conclusion was reached based on the following material weaknesses noted by management: 

a) 
 We
 have a lack of segregation of duties due to the small size of the Company. 

b) 
 The
 Company did not maintain reasonable control over records underlying transactions necessary to permit preparation of the Company s
 financial statements. 

c) 
 Lack
 of controls that provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposal
 of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

d) 
 Lack
 of a formal CFO position who can devote significant attention to financial reporting resulted in multiple audit adjustments. 

e) 
 Lack
 of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls
 and procedures. Management believes the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective oversight in the establishment
 and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements
 in future period. 

Management
expects to strengthen internal control during 2024 by developing stronger business and financial processes for accounting for transactions,
which will enhance internal control for the Company.
