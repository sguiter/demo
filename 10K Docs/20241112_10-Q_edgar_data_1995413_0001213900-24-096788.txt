Class A Ordinary Share at a price of per share. 

Transaction
costs amounted to consisting of of cash underwriting fee, of deferred underwriting fee (see additional
discussion in Note 6), and of other offering costs. 

The
Company s management Management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds
of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally
toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully.
The Company must complete a Business Combination with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value
of at least of the value of the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes paid
or payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of execution of the definitive agreement for such Business Combination.
The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding
voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register

per Public Share,
as of September 30, 2024, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the
Company to pay its tax obligations, in addition to any Permitted Withdrawals (as defined below). There will be no redemption rights upon
the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption were recorded at redemption
value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity ASC 480 ). 

The
Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least either immediately
prior to or upon consummation of such a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the shares
voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to
hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association (the Amended and Restated Memorandum ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business
Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval
for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy
rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination,
the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial
Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public
Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all. 

Notwithstanding
the above, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant
to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such
shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section
13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares
with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
Sponsor has agreed to waive redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any Public Shares it may acquire during or after
the Initial Public Offering in connection with the completion of the Business Combination. 

The
Company has until November 24, 2025 (or February 24, 2026 if the Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive
agreement for an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering), or until such earlier
liquidation date as the Company s board of directors (the Board may approve, to complete a Business Combination
(the Combination Period ). The Company may also hold a shareholder vote at any time to amend the Amended and Restated Memorandum
to modify the Combination Period. The Company will provide the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of
their Public Shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination, including
interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of amounts withdrawn to fund the Company s working capital requirements,
subject to an annual limit of , and to pay its taxes Permitted Withdrawals ), divided by the number of then outstanding
Public Shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. 

On
April 1, 2024, the Company withdrew from the Trust Account as a Permitted Withdrawal for working capital purposes. 

The
underwriters of the Initial Public Offering have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust
Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts
will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares.

in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per Public Share due to reductions in
the value of the Trust Account assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party
or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such
waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). 

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going
Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of held outside of the Trust Account and working capital of . The Company
will use such funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence
on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their
representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate
and complete a Business Combination. 

From

capital requirements in connection with completing a Business Combination and (ii) funds to pay its taxes. As of September 30, 2024,

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with the initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or
certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required on a non-interest
bearing basis Working Capital Loans ). If the Company completes the initial Business Combination, the Company will repay
such Working Capital Loans. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used for
such repayment. Up to of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of per warrant at the
option of the lender, upon consummation of the initial Business Combination. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement
Warrants. Other than as set forth above, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements
exist with respect to such Working Capital Loans. There were no Working Capital Loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023. 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern
considerations in accordance with ASC 205-40, Going Concern, as of September 30, 2024, the Company may need to raise additional capital
through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers,
directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they
deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able
to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to
conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential
transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially
acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
through one year from the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements if a Business Combination is not consummated. These unaudited
condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of
the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company does not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating its business.
However, if the Company s estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating
a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate
its business prior to its Business Combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its
Business Combination or because the Company may become obligated to redeem a significant number of its Public Shares upon consummation
of its Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business
Combination.

Shares. The remaining Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.

regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of Management for future operations, are forward-looking
statements. When used in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect,

Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed
in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on September 27, 2023, formed for the purpose of effecting a Business Combination
with one or more businesses or entities. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the
Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure our shareholders that our plans
to complete a Business Combination will be successful. 

We
have until November 24, 2025 (or February 24, 2026 if we have an executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement
for an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering), or until such earlier liquidation
date as our Board may approve, to complete a Business Combination. We may also hold a shareholder vote at any time to amend the Amended
and Restated Memorandum to modify the Combination Period. We will provide the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all
or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal
to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial Business
Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of Permitted Withdrawals), divided by the number of
then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described elsewhere in the Report. 

On
January 9, 2024, we announced that, commencing on January 11, 2024, the holders of the Units, each Unit consisting of one Public Share
and one-third of one Public Warrant, with each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share
for 11.50 per share, could elect to separately trade the Public Shares and the Public Warrants included in the Units. No fractional
Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. Any Units not separated will continue
to trade on the NYSE under the symbol CLBR.U. The Public Shares and the Public Warrants now trade on the NYSE under the
symbols CLBR and CLBR.WS, respectively. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact Continental,
our transfer agent, in order to separate the Units into Public Shares and Public Warrants. 

The
SEC has adopted new rules and regulations relating to SPACs, which became effective on July 1, 2024. The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among
other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC sponsors and related persons; (ii) additional disclosures relating to SPACs 
business combination transactions (iii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors
and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and business combination transactions; (iv) additional disclosures regarding
projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions and (v) the requirement that
both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for business combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s
adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company
Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance
of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and may
increase the costs and time related thereto.

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from September 27, 2023 (inception) through
September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for and consummate the Initial Public Offering, and identifying
a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business
Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur
expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due
diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 1,440,771, which consisted of interest earned on marketable securities
held in the Trust Account of 2,266,437, offset by operating expenses of 825,666. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 4,754,520, which consisted of interest earned on marketable securities
held in the Trust Account of 6,735,555, offset by operating expenses of 1,981,035. 

For
the period from September 27, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, we had a net loss off 13,359, which consisted of operating
expenses. 

Factors
That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations 

Our
results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could
cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted
by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in
interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical
instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more
of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete
an initial Business Combination. 

Liquidity,
 Capital Resources and Going Concern 

On
November 24, 2023, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 17,000,000 Units, which includes the partial exercise by the underwriters
of their over-allotment option in the amount of 2,000,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 170,000,000. Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, pursuant to the Warrant Subscription Agreement, we consummated the sale of 5,000,000
Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, or 5,000,000 in the aggregate. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1,726,456. Net income of 4,754,520 was affected
by interest earned on marketable securities of 6,735,555 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used 254,579 of cash
from operating activities. 

For
the period from September 27, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 0. 

From
interest earned on the Trust Account, we can withdraw, as Permitted Withdrawals, (i) up to 1,000,000 annually to fund working capital
requirements in connection with completing a Business Combination and (ii) funds to pay our taxes. 

On
April 1, 2024, we withdrew 1,000,000 from the Trust Account as a Permitted Withdrawal for working capital purposes and as of September
30, 2024, 1,000,000 in Permitted Withdrawals had been removed from the Trust Account. 

On
September 27, 2023, the Sponsor loaned us an aggregate of up to 300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant
to the IPO Promissory Note. This loan was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of December 31, 2024, or the date on which
we consummated the Initial Public Offering. The outstanding balance of 196,319 was repaid at the closing of the Initial Public Offering
on November 24, 2023, and borrowings under the IPO Promissory Note are no longer available. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of approximately 176,592,012 (including approximately
 6,592,012 of interest income). We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing
interest earned on the Trust Account, which interest shall be net of Permitted Withdrawals and excluding deferred underwriting commissions,
to complete our Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account for any Permitted Withdrawals. To the extent that
our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held
in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue our growth strategies. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash of 480,735 held outside of the Trust Account. We use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily
to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices,
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material
agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 

19 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with the initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or
certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us Working Capital Loans as may be required on a non-interest
bearing basis. If we complete the initial Business Combination, we will repay such Working Capital Loans. In the event that the initial
Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such Working
Capital Loans, but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans
may be convertible into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender, upon consummation of the initial Business
Combination. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Other than as set forth above, the terms of such Working
Capital Loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such Working
Capital Loans. There were no Working Capital Loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern
considerations in accordance with ASC 205-40, Going Concern, as of September 30, 2024, the Company may need to raise additional capital
through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers,
directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they
deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able
to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to
conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential
transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially
acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
through one year from the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements if a Business Combination is not consummated. These unaudited
condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of
the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do
not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as
 variable interest entities , which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt
or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than the (i) the
Administrative Services Agreement and (ii) Services and Indemnification Agreement. Under the Administrative Services Agreement, we pay
 10,000 per month to an affiliate of our Sponsor for office space and secretarial and administrative support services. Under the Services
and Indemnification Agreement, we pay an affiliate of the Sponsor 60,000 per month for the services of our Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer, and Chief Operating Officer. We will cease these monthly fees under both the Administrative
Services Agreement and the Services and Indemnification Agreement upon the earlier to occur of the completion of our initial Business
Combination or liquidation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have paid 30,000 and 90,000, respectively, pursuant
to the Administrative Services Agreement and 180,000 and 540,000, respectively, pursuant to the Services and Indemnification Agreement. 

The
underwriters of the Initial Public Offering were entitled to a cash underwriting fee of 0.15 per Unit, or 2,550,000 in the aggregate,
paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, 0.35 per Unit, or 5,950,000 in the aggregate, will be payable to
the underwriters for a deferred underwriting fee. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the
Trust Account solely if we complete an initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement for the Initial
Public Offering. Up to 0.30 per Unit of the 0.35 at our sole discretion may be reallocated for expenses in connection with our initial
Business Combination and working capital needs post the initial Business Combination. Any such reduction of the deferred underwriting
fee shall reduce proportionately the deferred underwriting fee to the underwriters and will also reduce proportionately the amount payable
to Roth under the Financial Advisory Services Agreement. 

On
November 20, 2023, we entered into the Financial Advisory Services Agreement with Roth, pursuant to which, Roth provided us with consulting
and advisory services in connection with the Initial Public Offering. Roth represented our interests only, was independent of the underwriters
and was not a party to any securities purchase agreement with us, the underwriters, or investors in relation to the Initial Public Offering.
Roth did not participate (within the meaning of FINRA Rule 5110(j)(16)) in the Initial Public Offering; acted as an independent financial
adviser (within the meaning of FINRA Rule 5110(j)(9)), and it did not act as an underwriter in connection with the Initial Public Offering.
Under the Financial Advisory Services Agreement, Roth s fee was 510,000, payable upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering.
A deferred fee of up to 1,190,000 will be paid to Roth at the closing of the Business Combination. This deferred fee will only be paid
to Roth if we completed a Business Combination. Roth s fees in both cases will be offset from the underwriting fees already recorded
between the cash underwriting fee of 2,550,000 and the deferred underwriting fee of 5,950,000, resulting in no additional incremental
fee already recorded by us.

Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially
differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates. The following are the critical accounting policies: 

Ordinary
Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 

We
account for our Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). Ordinary Shares subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability
instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares that feature redemption
rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Ordinary Shares are classified as shareholders equity. Our
Ordinary Shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain
future events. Accordingly, Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders 
deficit section of our balance sheet of the unaudited condensed financial statement included in this Report under Item 1. Financial
Statements . 

Warrant
Instruments 

We
account for Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments 
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC
815 ). The assessment considers whether the instruments are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition
of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815,
including whether the instruments are indexed to a company s common shares and whether the instrument holders could potentially
require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of a company s control, among other conditions for equity classification.
This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of Warrant issuance and as of each subsequent
quarterly period end date while the instruments are outstanding. Upon review of the Warrant Agreement, Management concluded that the
Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants issued pursuant to such warrant agreement qualify for equity accounting treatment. 

Net
Income per Ordinary Share 

We
comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. We have two classes of shares,
Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income
per Ordinary Share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the period. Accretion
associated with the redeemable Ordinary Shares is excluded from income per Ordinary Share as the redemption value approximates fair value. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU Topic 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 ). This update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to
be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about
past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability
of the reported amount. Since June 2016, the FASB issued clarifying updates to the new standard including changing the effective date
for smaller reporting companies. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2016-13, as of November 24, 2023. There was no effect from such adoption
to the unaudited condensed financial statement included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . 

21 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU Topic 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify certain financial
instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features
from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts
in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments
that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including
the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06, as of
September 27, 2023 (inception). There was no effect from such adoption to the unaudited condensed financial statement included in this
Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the unaudited condensed financial statement included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

22 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings. 

To
the knowledge of our Management Team, there is no material litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers
or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

As
a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. For additional
risks relating to our operations, other than as set forth below, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our (i)
IPO Registration Statement and (ii) 2023 Annual Report. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect
on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate
an initial Business Combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in
our future filings with the SEC. 

If
our initial Business Combination involves a company organized under the laws of a state of the United States, it is possible a 1 U.S.
federal excise tax will be imposed on us in connection with redemptions of our ordinary shares after or in connection with such initial
Business Combination. 

On
August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 became law in the United States, which, among other things, imposes a 1 excise
tax (the Excise Tax on the fair market value of certain repurchases (including certain redemptions) of stock by
publicly traded domestic (i.e., United States) corporations (and certain non-U.S. corporations treated as surrogate foreign corporations ).
The Excise Tax will apply to stock repurchases occurring in 2023 and beyond. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1 of the fair
market value of the shares of stock repurchased at the time of the repurchase. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the Excise Tax.
In April 2024, the Treasury issued proposed regulations providing guidance with respect to the Excise Tax. Taxpayers may rely on these
proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Under the proposed regulations, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded
domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year as a liquidation
is completed will also be exempt from such tax. 

As
an entity incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company, the 1 Excise Tax is not expected to apply to redemptions of our Class A
Ordinary Shares (absent any regulations and other additional guidance that may be issued in the future with retroactive effect). 

However,
in connection with an initial Business Combination if involving a company organized under the laws of the United States, it is possible
that we domesticate and continue as a Delaware corporation prior to certain redemptions and, because our securities are trading on NYSE,
it is possible that we will be subject to the Excise Tax with respect to any subsequent redemptions, including redemptions in connection
with the initial Business Combination, that are treated as repurchases for this purpose (other than, pursuant to recently issued guidance
from the Treasury Department, redemptions in complete liquidation of the company). In all cases, the extent of the Excise Tax that may
be incurred will depend on a number of factors, including the fair market value of our stock redeemed, the extent such redemptions could
be treated as dividends and not repurchases, and the content of any regulations and other additional guidance from the Treasury that
may be issued and applicable to the redemptions. Issuances of stock by a repurchasing corporation in a year in which such corporation
repurchases stock may reduce the amount of Excise Tax imposed with respect to such repurchase. The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing
corporation itself, not the shareholders from which stock is repurchased. The imposition of the Excise Tax as a result of redemptions
in connection with the initial Business Combination could, however, reduce the amount of cash available to pay redemptions or reduce
the cash contribution to the target business in connection with our initial Business Combination, which could cause the other shareholders
of the combined company to economically bear the impact of such Excise Tax.
