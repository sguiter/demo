All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through our use of words such as may, will, anticipate, assume, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, expect, estimate, continue, plan, project, could, intend, target and other similar words and expressions of the future. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; 

statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; 

statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and 

estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 

These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of the management of Eagle Bancorp Montana, Inc. Eagle or the Company and Opportunity Bank of Montana OBMT or the Bank ), Eagle s wholly-owned subsidiary, and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. 
 
 The following factors, among others, could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital requirements; 

local, regional, national and international economic and market conditions and events, as well as the impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and the impact they may have on us, our customers and our assets and liabilities; 

competition among depository and other traditional and non-traditional financial service providers; 

risks related to the concentration of our business in Montana, including risks associated with changes in the prices, values and sales volume of residential and commercial real estate in Montana; 

inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments or reduces loan demand; 

our ability to attract deposits and other sources of funding or liquidity; 

the impact of adverse developments affecting the U.S. banking industry, including bank failures and liquidity concerns, which could cause continued or worsening economic and market volatility, and regulatory responses thereto; 

the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties, including the impact of supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and labor shortages on economic conditions and our business; 

an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; 

uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; 

our ability to assess and monitor the effect of artificial intelligence on our business and operations; 

our ability to achieve environmental, social and governance goals and commitments or the impact of any changes in the Company s sustainability strategy or commitments generally; 

changes or volatility in the securities markets that lead to impairment in the value of our investment securities and goodwill; 

our ability to implement our growth strategy, including identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions, raising additional capital to finance such transactions, entering new markets, possible failures in realizing the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions and an inability of our personnel, systems and infrastructure to keep pace with such growth; 

unforeseen events, such as pandemics or natural disasters, and any governmental or societal responses thereto; 

the effect of acquisitions we may make, if any, including, without limitation, the failure to achieve expected revenue growth and/or expense savings from such acquisitions; 

risks related to the integration of any businesses we have acquired or expect to acquire, including exposure to potential asset quality and credit quality risks and unknown or contingent liabilities, the time and costs associated with integrating systems, technology platforms, procedures and personnel; 

potential impairment on the goodwill we have recorded or may record in connection with business acquisitions; 

political developments, uncertainties or instability; 

our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; 

the need to retain capital for strategic or regulatory reasons; 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

our ability to continue to increase and manage our commercial and residential real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans; 

the level of future deposit insurance premium assessments; 

our ability to implement new technologies and maintain secure and reliable technology systems; 

our ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable information technology systems, effectively defend ourselves against cyberattacks, or recover from breaches to our cybersecurity infrastructure; 

the failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of allowance for possible loan losses and other estimates; 

changes in the financial performance and/or condition of our borrowers and their ability to repay their loans when due; and 

the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other accounting standard setters. 

Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. For a further list and description of various risks, relevant factors and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements, see the Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections contained elsewhere in this report, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, any subsequent Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and other filings with the SEC.

Based on analysis of available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024 , the Company determined the decline in value was unrelated to credit losses and was primarily caused by changes in interest rates and market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of the securities. Management does not intend to sell and the Company is not likely to be required to sell these securities prior to maturity. As a result, ACL was recorded on available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . As part of this determination, consideration was given to the extent to which fair value was less than amortized cost, adverse security ratings by a rating agency and other factors.

Available-for-Sale Securities Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 (nationally recognized securities exchanges) and Level 2 inputs. For level 2 securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include but is not limited to dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U. S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and conditions. 
 
 Loans Held-for-Sale These loans are reported at fair value. Fair value is determined based on expected proceeds based on committed sales contracts and commitments of similar loans if not already committed and are considered Level 2 inputs. 
 
 Derivative Instruments The fair value of the interest rate lock commitments, forward TBA mortgage-backed securities and mandatory forward commitments are estimated using quoted or published market prices for similar instruments and adjusted for factors such as pull-through rate assumptions based on historical information, where appropriate. Interest rate lock commitments are considered Level 3 inputs and forward TBA mortgage-backed securities and mandatory forward commitments are considered Level 2 inputs. 
 
 Collateral-Dependent Loans Individually reviewed collateral-dependent loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. Collateral-dependent loans are considered Level 3 inputs. Collateral values are estimated using Level 3 inputs based on internally customized discounting criteria. 
 
 Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets Fair values are determined at the time the loan is foreclosed upon and the asset is transferred from loans. The value is based primarily on third party appraisals, less costs to sell and are considered Level 3 inputs for determining fair value. Repossessed assets are reviewed and evaluated periodically for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 
 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair value of mortgage servicing rights are estimated using net present value of expected cash flows based on a third party model that incorporates industry assumptions and is adjusted for factors such as prepayment speeds and are considered Level 3 inputs. 
 
 The following tables summarize financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Introduction 
 
 Eagle Bancorp Montana, Inc. is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act, is incorporated under the laws of Delaware and headquartered in Helena, Montana. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, Opportunity Bank of Montana (the "Bank"), is a Montana-state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. 
 
 This discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is necessary to understand Eagle's financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023. The following should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying Notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in Eagle's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 6, 2024, and in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying Notes thereto, included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the future results that may be attained for the entire year or other interim periods. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 
 The Company s primary business activity is the ownership of the Bank. The Bank focuses on consumer, commercial, and agricultural lending. It engages in typical banking activities: acquiring deposits from local markets and originating loans and investing in securities. Our earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans and investment securities, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits, borrowed funds, and trust-preferred securities. Net interest income is a function of our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, as well as a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets compared to interest-bearing liabilities. Also contributing to our earnings is noninterest income, which consists primarily of service charges and fees on loan and deposit products and services, net gains and losses on sale of assets, and mortgage loan service fees. Net interest income and noninterest income are offset by provisions for credit losses, general administrative and other expenses, including salaries and employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs, as well as by state and federal income tax expense. 
 
 The Bank has focused on diversifying the loan portfolio over the past decade, adding commercial and agricultural loans to the strong mortgage lending proficiency. Loan originations represented by single-family residential mortgages enabled the Bank to successfully market home equity loans, as well as a wide range of shorter-term consumer loans for various personal needs (automobiles, recreational vehicles, etc.). The Bank has grown the commercial loan portfolio in both real estate and non-real estate, and further added agricultural loans, which have a shorter term and slightly higher interest rate, through acquisitions. The purpose of diversification is to mitigate the Bank s exposure to specific market segments, as well as to improve our ability to manage our interest rate spread. This has provided additional interest income and improved interest rate sensitivity. The Bank s management recognizes that fee income will also enable it to be less dependent on specialized lending and it now maintains a significant loan serviced portfolio which provides a steady source of fee income. Fee income is also supplemented with fees generated from deposit accounts. The Bank has a high percentage of non-maturity deposits, such as checking accounts and savings accounts, which allows management flexibility in managing its spread. Non-maturity deposits and certificates of deposits do not automatically reprice as interest rates rise. Gain on sale of loans also provides significant noninterest income in periods of high mortgage loan origination volumes. Such income will be, and has recently been, adversely affected in periods of lower mortgage activity. 
 
 Management continues to focus on improving the Bank s earnings. Management believes the Bank needs to continue to concentrate on increasing net interest margin, other areas of fee income and control of operating expenses to achieve earnings growth going forward. Management s strategy of growing the loan portfolio and deposit base is expected to help achieve these goals as follows: loans typically earn higher rates of return than investments; a larger deposit base should yield higher fee income; increasing the asset base will reduce the relative impact of fixed operating costs. The biggest challenge to this strategy is funding growth in an efficient manner. It may become more difficult to maintain deposit growth due to significant competition, the current conditions in the banking industry and possible reduced customer demand for deposits as customers may shift into other asset classes. 
 
 The level and movement of interest rates impacts the Bank s earnings as well. The Federal Open Market Committee increased the federal funds target rate to 5.50 during the year ended December 31, 2023. The rate was decreased to 5.00 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Financial Condition continued 
 
 Lending Activities continued 
 
 Generally, our collection procedures provide that when a loan is 15 or more days delinquent, the borrower is sent a past due notice. If the loan becomes 30 days delinquent, the borrower is sent a written delinquency notice requiring payment. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower, including face to face meetings and counseling to resolve the delinquency. All collection actions are undertaken with the objective of compliance with the Fair Debt Collection Act. 
 
 For mortgage loans and home equity loans, if the borrower is unable to cure the delinquency or reach a payment agreement, we will institute foreclosure actions. If a foreclosure action is taken and the loan is not reinstated, paid in full or refinanced, the property is sold at judicial sale at which we may be the buyer if there are no adequate offers to satisfy the debt. Any property acquired as the result of foreclosure, or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold or otherwise disposed of. When real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less estimated selling costs. The initial recording of any loss is charged to the allowance for credit lo sses. Subsequent write-downs are recorded as a charge to operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there was 4,000 and 5,000 of real estate owned and other repossessed property.

The Bank's commercial real estate loans are primarily permanent loans secured by improved property such as office buildings, retail stores, commercial warehouses, and apartment buildings. The terms and conditions of each loan are tailored to the needs of the borrower and based on the financial strength of the project and any guarantors. Generally, commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank will not exceed 80.0 of the appraised value or the selling price of the property, whichever is less. The Bank's commercial real estate portfolio's average loan-to-value ratio range was 26 to 51 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Bank's asset quality with respect to commercial real estate loans has remained strong despite recent economic and market conditions. The Bank has limited exposure in the office space sector, none of which is located in central business districts. Management believes that the Bank has implemented appropriate risk management practices, including regular and ongoing loan reviews, stress tests, and sensitivity analysis. Loan reviews include monitoring past due rates, non-performing trends, concentrations, loan to values, and other qualitative factors. The Bank's loan policy is robust and is updated annually or as needed to meet the risk mitigation and strategic goals of the bank.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Analysis of Net Interest Income 
 
 The Bank s earnings have historically depended primarily upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and any borrowed funds. It is the single largest component of Eagle s operating income. Net interest income is affected by (i) the difference between rates of interest earned on loans and investments and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings (the interest rate spread and (ii) the relative amounts of loans and investments and interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. 
 
 The following table includes average balances for financial condition items, as well as interest and dividends and average yields related to the average balances. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields include the effect of deferred fees and discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Income. Eagle s net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.71 million compared to 2.64 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 74,000 was due to a decrease in noninterest expense of 605,000 and an increase in net interest income after provision for credit losses of 526,000. These were largely offset by a decrease in noninterest income of 1.06 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of 5,000. For the current period, basic earnings per common share was 0.35 and diluted earnings per common share was 0.34. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were both 0.34 for the prior year comparable period. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased to 15.80 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 15.59 million for the same quarter in the prior year. The increase of 215,000, or 1.4 , was the result of an increase in interest and dividend income of 2.67 million largely offset by an increase in interest expense of 2.45 million. 
 
 Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income was 26.76 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.09 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2.67 million, or 11.1 was driven by interest and fees on loans, which increased to 23.80 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 21.07 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest and fees on loans was due to an increase in the average yield on loans, as well as an increase in the average balance of loans. The average interest rate earned on loans receivable increased by 44 basis points, from 5.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 6.10 for the current period. Interest accretion on purchased loans was 167,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted in a 3 basis point increase in net interest margin compared to 175,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in a 4 basis point increase in net interest margin. Average balances for loans receivable, including loans held-for-sale, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.55 billion compared to 1.48 billion for the prior year period. This represents an increase of 70.67 million, or 4.8 and was due to organic growth. Interest on investment securities available-for-sale decreased by 196,000 period over period, primarily due to the decrease in average balances for investments from 319.31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 305.73 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Expense. Total interest expense was 10.96 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.51 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2.45 million was due to an increase of 2.04 million in interest expense on deposits, as well as a net increase of 413,000 in interest expense on total borrowings. The overall average rate on total deposits was up from 1.28 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 1.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, the average balance for total deposits was 1.62 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.60 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on total borrowings was driven by the average balance of FHLB advances and other borrowings, increasing from 192.88 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 228.47 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Short-term borrowings have increased to fund loan growth. However, the average rate paid on FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased from 5.50 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses. Provision for credit losses was 277,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 588,000 in provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes a provision for credit losses on loans of 317,000 and a decrease in the provision for unfunded commitments of 40,000. 
 
 Noninterest Income. Total noninterest income was 4.98 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.04 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.06 million, or 17.5 , was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking, net, of 1.74 million. Mortgage banking, net, includes net gain on sale of mortgage loans which decreased to 1.69 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.59 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 51.02 million residential mortgage loans were sold compared to 109.02 million in the same period in the prior year. Mortgage volumes continued to be impacted by the interest rate environment. Gross margin levels increased 2 basis points from 3.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.31 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in mortgage banking, net, was partially offset by an increase in income from bank owned life insurance of 656,000, increasing to 1.04 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 382,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was 17.27 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.88 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 605,000 or 3.4 . The largest driver of the decrease was salaries and employee benefits, decreasing 8.7 from 9.89 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 10.84 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was 529,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 524,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 16.3 for the current period compared to 16.6 for the prior period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The Bank is required by regulation to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity for safety and soundness purposes. Appropriate levels of liquidity will depend upon the types of activities in which the company engages. For internal reporting purposes, the Bank uses policy minimums of 1.0 and 8.0 for basic surplus and basic surplus with FHLB as internally defined. In general, the basic surplus is a calculation of the ratio of unencumbered short-term assets reduced by estimated percentages of CD maturities and other deposits that may leave the Bank in the next 90 days divided by total assets. Basic surplus with FHLB adds to basic surplus the additional borrowing capacity the Bank has with the FHLB of Des Moines. The Bank exceeded those minimum ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 The Bank s primary sources of funds are deposits, repayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investments, funds provided from operations, advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and other borrowings. Scheduled repayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities and maturities of investment securities are generally predictable. However, other sources of funds, such as deposit flows and loan prepayments, can be greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company uses liquidity resources principally to fund existing and future loan commitments. It also uses them to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals, for investment purposes, to meet operating expenses and capital expenditures, for dividend payments and for stock repurchases to maintain adequate liquidity levels. 
 
 Liquidity may be adversely affected by unexpected deposit outflows, higher interest rates paid by competitors, and similar matters. Management monitors projected liquidity needs and determines the level desirable based in part on the Bank's commitments to make loans and management s assessment of the Bank's ability to generate funds. 
 
 The Company's available borrowing capacity was approximately 348.10 million as of September 30, 2024 and 398.50 million as of December 31, 2023 .

During the first quarter of 2023, the FRB offered a new Bank Term Funding Program ("BTFP") for eligible depository institutions. The BTFP offered loans of up to one year in length to institutions pledging collateral eligible for purchase by FRB such as U.S. treasuries, agency securities, and mortgage-backed securities. These assets were valued at par. In March of 2024, the Company accessed borrowings through the BTFP. In September of 2024, the Company paid off the borrowings. 
 
 In addition to bank level liquidity management, Eagle must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs, including the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock, share repurchases, payment of general corporate expense, and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries. The primary source of liquidity for Eagle consists of dividends from the Bank, which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the Montana Division of Banking and Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve, and access to capital markets. Eagle has a 15.00 million line of credit with a correspondent bank. There was no outstanding balance for this line of credit at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Eagle's ability to receive dividends from the Bank in future periods will depend on several factors, including, without limitation, the Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity, and overall condition. In addition, both the Montana Division of Banking and Financial Institutions and Federal Reserve may require approval to pay dividends, based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations. 
 
 Eagle presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above, including existing liquid funds on hand, are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs in the short and long term. However, if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate, regulatory capital requirements for Eagle or the Bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise, or Eagle were to believe it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels, then Eagle may seek additional liquidity from external sources.

Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s internally determined measurement of sensitivity to interest rate movements as measured by a 300 basis point rise in interest rates scenario, increased the economic value of equity EVE by 2.3 compared to a decrease of 1.9 at December 31, 2023. A 300 basis point decrease in interest rates scenario decreased EVE by 17.0 compared to a decrease of 18.2 at December 31, 2023. The Bank is within the guidelines set forth by the Board of Directors for interest rate risk sensitivity in rising interest rate scenarios. 
 
 The Bank's regulatory capital was in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements and the Bank is deemed "well capitalized" pursuant to State of Montana and FRB rules as of September 30, 2024 . The Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios as of September 30, 2024 are presented in the table below and all of the ratios, with the exception of the Tier 1 capital adjusted total average assets ratio, include the capital conservation buffer of 2.50 .

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are found in Part I, Item 1, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate risk is the potential for loss of future earnings resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. Interest rate risk results from several factors and could have a significant impact on the Company s net interest income, which is the Company's primary source of revenue. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the relationship between rates on interest-bearing assets and liabilities, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments and the mix of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. 
 
 Although interest rate risk is inherent in the banking industry, banks are expected to have sound risk management practices in place to measure, monitor and control interest rate exposures. The objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. The process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates. 
 
 The ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the Company s asset/liability committee, which is governed by policies established by the Company s Board that are reviewed and approved annually. The Board delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset/liability management policies to the Bank s asset/liability committee. In this capacity, the asset/liability committee develops guidelines and strategies impacting the Company s asset/liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity, policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends. The Company s goal of its asset and liability management practices is to maintain or increase the level of net interest income within an acceptable level of interest rate risk. 
 
 The Bank has established acceptable levels of interest rate risk as follows for an instantaneous and permanent shock in rates: projected net interest income over the next twelve months (i.e. year-1) will not be reduced by more than 15 given an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of up to 300 basis points, and the subsequent twelve months (i.e. year-2) will not be reduced by more than 20.0 given an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of up to 300 basis points. 
 
 The following table includes the Bank s net interest income sensitivity analysis.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of Eagle are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Eagle has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies, consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and business combinations. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Eagle has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation, and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on Eagle s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Eagle s financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in "Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Eagle s 2023 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. There have been no significant changes to the accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions, or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in Eagle s 2023 Form 10-K, other than the following: 
 
 The excess of consideration paid over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate impairment may exist. A goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. An impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. Estimating the fair value of the reporting unit requires the use of inputs and assumptions including projected earnings of the Company in future years for which there is inherent uncertainty. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Management performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test with assistance from a third-party valuation specialist. The interim determination was primarily driven by a revision in the Company s earnings outlook in comparison to budget. A weighted average of both the market and income approaches was used in valuing the reporting unit s fair value. The interim goodwill impairment assessment as of August 31, 2024 concluded that goodwill was not impaired. However, changing economic conditions that may adversely affect the Company's performance, the fair value of its assets and liabilities, or its stock price could result in future impairment. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Management will continue to monitor events that could influence this conclusion in the future.

Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the last quarter, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
