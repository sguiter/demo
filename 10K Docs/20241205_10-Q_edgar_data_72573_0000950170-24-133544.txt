The fair values of the Company s available-for-sale securities are based on quoted market prices. The assets related to the Company s defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan SERP consist of both employer (employee unvested) and employee assets which are invested in investment funds with fair values calculated based on quoted market prices. The SERP liability represents the Company s liability to the employees in the plan for their vested balances. The hedge derivatives consist of cash flow hedging instruments and forward contracts (see Note 7 for further discussion) and are entered into by the Company principally to reduce its exposure to Swiss Franc and Euro exchange rate risks. Fair values of the Company s hedge derivatives are calculated based on quoted foreign exchange rates and quoted interest rates. The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan in Switzerland. The plan covers certain international employees and is based on years of service and compensation on a career-average pay basis. The assets within the plan are classified as a Level 3 asset within the fair value hierarchy and consist of an investment in pooled assets and include separate employee accounts that are invested in equity securities, debt securities and real estate. The values of the separate accounts invested are based on values provided by the administrator of the funds that cannot be readily derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The value of the assets is part of the defined benefit plan and included in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at October 31, 2024, January 31, 2024, and October 31, 2023. There were transfers between any levels of the fair value hierarchy for any of the Company s fair value measurements. Investments Without Readily Determinable Fair Values From time to time the Company may make minority investments in growth companies in the consumer products sector and other sectors relevant to its business, including certain of the Company's suppliers and customers, as well as in venture capital funds that invest in companies in media, entertainment, information technology and technology-related fields and in digital assets. Through fiscal 2024, the Company invested approximately million and during the first nine months of fiscal 2025, the Company invested an additional m illion in venture capital funds. The Company has evaluated and will regularly evaluate the carrying value of its investments. One consumer products company in which the Company made an equity investment in fiscal year 2022 sold its business and assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 in a transaction tha t yielded little return for equity holders. As a result, the Company fully impaired its million investment in this entity in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and the impairment is recorded in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The carrying value of the investments are recorded in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at October 31, 2024, January 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023.

million in underpaid duties for all imports that entered the United States during the audit period which extended from August 1, 2011 through July 15, 2016, plus possible penalties and interest. Although the Company believes that U.S. Customs alternative duty methodology and estimate were not consistent with the Company s facts and circumstances and consistently disputed U.S. Customs position, the Company previously established reserves for a portion of the alleged underpayment indicated in the audit report. Between February 2017 and January 2021, the Company made numerous submissions to U.S. Customs containing supplemental analyses and information in response to U.S. Customs information requests. On May 1, 2023, the statute of limitations lapsed with respect to all entries encompassed by the audit period. As a result, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company released the reserves that it had established in respect of those entries. The Company is involved in legal proceedings and claims from time to time, in the ordinary course of its business. Legal reserves are recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies. Contingencies are inherently unpredictable and it is possible that results of operations, balance sheets or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in any particular period by unfavorable developments in, or resolution or disposition of, such matters. For those legal proceedings and claims for which the Company believes that it is probable that a reasonably estimable loss may result, the Company records a reserve for the potential loss. For proceedings and claims where the Company believes it is reasonably possible that a loss may result that is materially in excess of amounts accrued for the matter, the Company either discloses an estimate of such possible loss or range of loss or includes a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. As of October 31, 2024, the Company is party to legal proceedings and contingencies, the resolution of which is not expected to materially affect its financial condition, future results of operations beyond the amounts accrued, or cash flows. 

million and million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was and for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The significant components of the effective tax rate changed primarily due to the tax consequences of a foreign currency gain related to an extraordinary intercompany dividend, an increase in valuation allowances against certain foreign losses and a limitation on a portion of the foreign tax credits and deductions related to the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI"). The Company recorded an income tax provision of million and million for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was and for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respective ly. The significant components of the effective tax rate changed primarily due to the tax consequences on a foreign currency gain related to an extraordinary intercompany dividend, a limitation on a portion of the foreign tax credits and deductions related to the tax on GILTI and an increase in valuation allowances against certain foreign losses. At October 31, 2024, the Company had deferred tax liability for substantially all of the undistributed foreign earnings of approximately million because the Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings in its foreign operations. It is not practicable to estimate the tax liability related to a future distribution of these permanently reinvested foreign earnings.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Company s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and those significant policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and contained in the Company's 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated by reference herein. The preparation of these financial statements and the application of certain critical accounting policies require management to make judgments based on estimates and assumptions that affect the information reported. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to sales discounts and markdowns, product returns, bad debt, inventories, income taxes, warranty obligations, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, impairments of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and the results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company's most critical accounting policies have been discussed in the Company's 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated by reference herein. As of October 31, 2024, there have been no material changes to any of the Company's critical accounting policies. 
 Overview 
 The Company conducts its business in two operating segments: Watch and Accessory Brands and Company Stores. The Company s Watch and Accessory Brands segment includes the designing, manufacturing and distribution of watches and, to a lesser extent, jewelry and other accessories, of owned and licensed brands, in addition to revenue generated from after-sales service activities and shipping. The Company Stores segment includes the Company s retail outlet business in the United States and Canada. The Company also operates in two major geographic locations: United States and International, the latter of which includes the results of all non-U.S. Company operations. 
 The Company divides its watch and accessory business into two principal categories: the owned brands category and the licensed brands category. The owned brands category consists of the Movado , Concord , EBEL , Olivia Burton and MVMT brands. Products in the licensed brands category include the following brands manufactured and distributed under license agreements with the respective brand owners: Coach , Tommy Hilfiger , Hugo Boss , Lacoste and Calvin Klein . 
 Gross margins vary among the brands included in the Company s portfolio and also among watch models within each brand. Watches in the Company s owned brands category generally earn higher gross margin percentages than watches in the licensed brands category. The difference in gross margin percentages within the licensed brands category is primarily due to the impact of royalty payments made on the licensed brands. Gross margins in the Company s e-commerce business generally earn higher gross margin percentages than those of the traditional wholesale business. Gross margins in the Company s outlet business are affected by the mix of product sold and may exceed those of the wholesale business since the Company earns margins on its outlet store sales from manufacture to point of sale to the consumer. 
 Recent Developments and Initiatives 
 
 Cost-Savings Initiative 
 
 During the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, in light of the ongoing challenging consumer-spending environment, the Company committed to a cost-savings initiative to reduce operating expenses through headcount reductions, bringing them more in line with sales and recorded 2.7 million in severance and payroll related charges. The Company expects the severance and payroll related expenses to be paid out within the next twelve months; 0.3 million of which was paid during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company expects go-forward annual savings from the cost-savings initiatives of approximately 6.5 million. 
 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 
 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into law by President Biden. Among other things, the IR Act implemented a 1 excise tax on the fair market stock repurchases by covered corporations, a 15 minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Although the Company is continuing to evaluate the IR Act and its potential impact on future periods, to date, the IR Act has not had a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 21 

The OECD has issued Pillar Two model rules implementing a new global minimum tax of 15 , which was intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the U.S. has not yet adopted the Pillar Two rules, several other countries have adopted and enacted changes to their legislation in response to Pillar Two. The Company's turnover currently does not meet the minimum requirements that were set by OECD inclusive framework and rules. Although the Company will continue to evaluate and monitor the enactments of Pillar Two, to the extent that Pillar Two becomes applicable, the Company does not expect a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

 22 

United States Watch and Accessory Brands Net Sales 
 Net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2024 in the United States locations of the Watch and Accessory Brands segment were 51.6 million, below the prior year period by 3.7 million, or 6.7 , resulting primarily from unfavorable sales mix and decreased volumes resulting from lower demand in the Company's wholesale customers, partially offset by an increase in online retail.

 International Watch and Accessory Brands Net Sales 
 Net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2024 in the International locations of the Watch and Accessory Brands segment were 110.3 million, above the prior year by 0.4 million, or 0.4 , which included fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that positively impacted net sales by 1.7 million when compared to the prior year period. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the positive impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix. The net sales increase recorded in the owned brands category was 0.3 million, or 2.3 , due to net sales increases in Asia and Europe, partially offset by net sales decreases in the Middle East and the Americas (excluding the United States). The net sales increase recorded in the licensed brands category was 1.3 million, or 1.3 , primarily due to net sales increases in the Americas (excluding the United States), Asia and the Middle East, partially offset by a net sales decrease in Europe. 
 Company Stores Net Sales 
 
 Net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2024 in the Company Stores segment were 20.9 million, 1.7 million or 7.5 below the prior year period.

As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company operated 56 and 55 retail outlet locations, respectively. 
 Gross Profit

The decrease in gross profit of 3.9 million was due to lower net sales combined with a lower gross margin percentage. The decrease in the gross margin percentage of approximately 70 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2024 reflected an unfavorable impact of sales mix of approximately 40 basis points, the decreased leveraging of certain fixed costs as a result of lower sales of approximately 20 basis points and a negative impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points. 
 Selling, General and Administrative SG A 
 SG A expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024 were 91.8 million, representing an increase from the prior year period of 10.2 million, or 12.5 .

The increase in SG A expenses of 10.4 million was primarily due to the following factors: higher marketing expenses of 5.7 million and an increase in payroll related expenses of 2.9 million (which included severance and payroll related costs of 2.7 million related to the cost-savings initiative).

 Net sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 were 478.7 million, representing a 14.3 million or 2.9 decrease from the prior year period. Both of the Company's operating segments experienced net sales declines. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had positively impacted net sales by 1.7 million when compared to the prior year period. Excluding this 1.7 million impact, net sales would have decreased by 3.2 as compared to the prior year period. 
 Watch and Accessory Brands Net Sales 
 Net sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 in the Watch and Accessory Brands segment were 415.2 million, below the prior year period by 9.6 million, or 2.3 . The decrease in net sales was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and decreased volumes resulting from lower demand in the Company's wholesale customers, mainly in the United States locations, partially offset by an increase in online retail in the United States locations and the positive impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
 United States Watch and Accessory Brands Net Sales 
 Net sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 in the United States locations of the Watch and Accessory Brands segment were 137.2 million, below the prior year period by 4.7 million, or 3.3 , resulting primarily from unfavorable sales mix and decreased volumes due to lower demand in the Company's wholesale customers, partially offset by an increase in online retail. The net sales recorded in the owned brands category decreased 9.2 million, or 8.4 , partially offset by an increase in net sales recorded in the licensed brand category of 4.2 million, or 13.3 . 
 International Watch and Accessory Brands Net Sales 
 Net sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 in the International locations of the Watch and Accessory Brands segment were 278.0 million, below the prior year by 4.9 million, or 1.7 , which included fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that positively impacted net sales by 1.7 million when compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix in the Company's wholesale customers, partially offset by the positive impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The net sales decrease recorded in the owned brands category was 4.5 million, or 10.9 , due to net sales decreases in the Middle East, Europe and the Americas (excluding the United States), partially offset by an increase in Asia. The net sales decrease in the licensed 
 25 

brands category was 1.9 million, or 0.8 , primarily due to net sales decreases in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas (excluding the United States), partially offset by a net sales increase in Asia. 
 Company Stores Net Sales 
 Net sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 in the Company Stores segment were 63.5 million, 4.6 million or 6.8 below the prior year period. The net sales decrease was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix in the Company stores, partially offset by an increase in sales from the Company's online outlet store at www.movadocompanystore.com. As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company operated 56 and 55 retail outlet locations, respectively. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was 260.3 million or 54.4 of net sales as compared to 273.6 million or 55.5 of net sales in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit of 13.3 million was due to lower net sales combined with a lower gross margin percentage. The decrease in the gross margin percentage of approximately 110 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 reflected an unfavorable impact of sales mix of approximately 80 basis points, the decreased leveraging of certain fixed costs as a result of lower sales of approximately 20 basis points and a negative impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points. 
 Selling, General and Administrative SG A 
 SG A expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 were 247.4 million, representing an increase from the prior year period of 15.0 million, or 6.5 . The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to the following factors: higher marketing expenses of 11.1 million and an increase in payroll related expenses of 4.5 million (which included severance and payroll related costs of 2.7 million related to the cost-savings initiative). These increases in SG A expenses were partially offset by a decrease of 0.5 million in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets being fully amortized and a decrease in performance-based compensation of 0.4 million. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, fluctuations in foreign currency rates related to the foreign subsidiaries unfavorably impacted SG A expenses by 0.8 million when compared to the prior year period. 
 Watch and Accessory Brands Operating Income 
 For the nine months ended October 31, 2024 the Company recorded operating income of 7.5 million in the Watch and Accessory Brands segment which includes 30.0 million of unallocated corporate expenses as well as 48.8 million of certain intercompany profits related to the Company s supply chain operations.

The decrease in operating income was the result of a decrease in gross profit of 10.2 million combined with higher SG A expenses of 14.2 million when compared to the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was the result of lower net sales combined with a lower gross margin percentage primarily due to an unfavorable impact of sales mix, the decreased leveraging of certain fixed costs as a result of lower sales and a negative impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The increase in SG A expenses of 14.2 million was primarily due to the following factors: higher marketing expenses of 10.8 million and an increase in payroll related expenses of 4.1 million (which included severance and payroll related costs of 2.7 million related to the cost-savings initiative). These increases in SG A expenses were partially offset by a decrease in performance-based compensation of 0.5 million and a decrease of 0.5 million in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets being fully amortized. 
 U.S. Watch and Accessory Brands Operating Loss 
 In the United States locations of the Watch and Accessory Brands segment, for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company recorded an operating loss of 34.1 million which includes unallocated corporate expenses of 30.0 million. For the nine months ended October 31, 2023 the Company recorded an operating loss of 26.7 million in the United States locations of the Watch and Accessory Brands segment which included unallocated corporate expenses of 36.0 million. The increase in operating loss was the result of a decrease in gross profit of 1.2 million combined with an increase in SG A expenses of 6.2 million when compared to the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit of 1.2 million was the result of lower net sales, partially offset by a higher gross margin percentage primarily due to the favorable impact of sales mix, partially offset by the decreased leveraging of certain fixed costs as a result of lower sales. The increase in SG A expenses of 6.2 million was primarily due to the following factors: higher marketing expenses of 5.9 million and an increase in payroll related expenses of 1.3 million (which included severance and payroll related costs of 1.5 million related to the cost-savings initiative). These increases in SG A expenses were partially offset by a decrease in performance-based compensation of 0.5 million.

The decrease in gross profit of 9.0 million was the result of lower net sales, combined with a lower gross margin percentage primarily due to an unfavorable impact of sales mix, the decreased leveraging of certain fixed costs as a result of lower sales and a negative impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

 The Company and its U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries (collectively, the "Borrowers") are parties to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement originally dated October 12, 2018 (as subsequently amended, the Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Agent ). The Credit Agreement provides for a 100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Facility and has a maturity date of October 28, 2026. The Facility includes a 15.0 million letter of credit subfacility, a 25.0 million swingline subfacility and a 75.0 million sublimit for borrowings by the Swiss Borrower, with provisions for uncommitted increases to the Facility of up to 50.0 million in the aggregate subject to customary terms and conditions. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants binding on the Company and its subsidiaries that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions and limitations on the incurrence of debt and liens, dispositions of assets, capital expenditures, dividends and other payments in respect of equity interests, the making of loans and equity investments, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, and transactions with affiliates (in each case, subject to various exceptions). 
 The borrowings under the Facility are joint and several obligations of the Borrowers and are also cross-guaranteed by each Borrower, except that the Swiss Borrower is not liable for, nor does it guarantee, the obligations of the U.S. Borrowers. In addition, the Borrowers' obligations under the Facility are secured by first priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on substantially all of the U.S. Borrowers' assets other than certain excluded assets. The Swiss Borrower does not provide collateral to secure the obligations under the Facility. 
 As of both October 31, 2024, and October 31, 2023, there were no amounts of loans outstanding under the Facility. Availability under the Facility was reduced by the aggregate number of letters of credit outstanding, issued in connection with retail and operating facility leases to various landlords and for Canadian payroll to the Royal Bank of Canada, totaling approximately 0.3 million at both October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023. At October 31, 2024, the letters of credit have expiration dates through June 2, 2025. As of both October 31, 2024, and October 31, 2023, availability under the Facility was 99.7 million. For additional information regarding the Facility, see Note 6 - Debt and Lines of Credit to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The Company had weighted average borrowings under the Facility of zero during both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The Company's Swiss subsidiary maintains unsecured lines of credit with a Swiss bank that are subject to repayment upon demand. As of October 31, 2024, and 2023, these lines of credit totaled 6.5 million Swiss Francs for both periods, with a dollar equivalent of 7.5 million and 7.1 million, respectively.

 28 

Cash paid for interest, including unused commitments fees, was 0.2 million for both the nine month periods ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, respectively. 
 From time to time the Company may make minority investments in growth companies in the consumer products sector and other sectors relevant to its business, including certain of the Company's suppliers and customers, as well as in venture capital funds that invest in companies in media, entertainment, information technology and technology-related fields and in digital assets. During fiscal 2022, the Company committed to invest up to 21.5 million in such investments. The Company funded approximately 8.4 million of these commitments through fiscal 2024 and an additional 5.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and may be called upon to satisfy capital calls in respect of the remaining 7.7 million in such commitments at any time during a period generally ending ten years after the first capital call in respect of a given commitment. One consumer products company in which the Company made an equity investment in fiscal year 2022 sold its business and assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 in a transaction that yielded little return for equity holders. As a result, the Company fully impaired its 0.5 million investment in this entity in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 During the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company has declared and paid a total of three separate cash dividends of 0.35 per share aggregating to 23.3 million.

Although the Company currently expects to continue to declare cash dividends in the future, the decision of whether to declare any future cash dividend, including the amount of any such dividend and the establishment of record and payment dates, will be determined, in each quarter, by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion. 
 On November 23, 2021, the Board approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to 50.0 million of its outstanding common stock through November 23, 2024, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. On December 5, 2024, the Board approved an additional share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to 50.0 million of its outstanding common stock through December 5, 2027, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors.

 Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2- Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements which may impact the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in future reporting periods. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 The Company s primary market risk exposure relates to foreign currency exchange risk (see Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements). A significant portion of the Company s purchases are denominated in Swiss Francs and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen. The Company also sells to third-party customers in a variety of foreign currencies, most notably the Euro, Swiss Franc and the British Pound. The Company reduces its exposure to the Swiss Franc, Euro, British Pound, Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen exchange rate risk through a hedging program. Under the hedging program, the Company manages most of its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows it to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets. In the event these exposures do not offset, from time to time the Company uses various derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposures to currency fluctuations, predominately forward and option contracts. Certain of these contracts meet the requirements of qualified hedges. In these circumstances, the Company designates and documents these derivative instruments as a cash flow hedge of a specific underlying exposure, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. Changes in the fair value of hedges designated and documented as a cash flow hedge and which are highly effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and then are later reclassified into earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. The earnings impact is mostly offset by the effects of currency movements on the underlying hedged transactions. To the extent that the Company does not engage in a hedging program, any change in the Swiss Franc, Euro, British Pound, Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen exchange rates to local currency would have an equal effect on the Company s earnings. 
 29 

From time to time the Company uses forward exchange contracts, which do not meet the requirements of qualified hedges, to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency receivables and liabilities. These forward contracts are not designated as qualified hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings in the period they arise, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect resulting from the revaluation of the related foreign currency receivables and liabilities. 
 As of October 31, 2024, the Company s entire net forward contracts hedging portfolio consisted of 7.3 million Chinese Yuan equivalent, 30.0 million Swiss Francs equivalent, 29.6 million U.S. dollars equivalent, 33.0 million Euros equivalent (including 9.0 million Euros designated as cash flow hedges) and 4.8 million British Pounds equivalent with various expiry dates ranging through April 10, 2025, compared to a portfolio of 20.7 million Chinese Yuan equivalent, 28.0 million Swiss Francs equivalent, 24.7 million U.S. dollars equivalent, 27.6 million Euros equivalent (including 3.0 million Euros designated as cash flow hedges) and 5.8 million British Pounds equivalent with various expiry dates ranging through April 4, 2024, as of October 31, 2023. If the Company were to settle its Swiss Franc forward contracts at October 31, 2024, the result would be a 0.1 million gain. If the Company were to settle its Euro forward contracts at October 31, 2024, the result would be a 0.2 million gain. As of October 31, 2024, the Company s British Pound, Chinese Yuan and US Dollar forward contracts had no gain or loss. 
 Commodity Risk 
 The Company considers its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices to be primarily related to gold used in the manufacturing of the Company s watches. Under its hedging program, the Company can purchase various commodity derivative instruments, primarily futures contracts. When held, these derivatives are documented as qualified cash flow hedges, and the resulting gains and losses on these derivative instruments are first reflected in other comprehensive income, and later reclassified into earnings, partially offset by the effects of gold market price changes on the underlying actual gold purchases. The Company did not hold any future contracts in its gold hedge portfolio as of October 31, 2024 and 2023; thus, any changes in the gold purchase price will have an equal effect on the Company s cost of sales. 
 Debt and Interest Rate Risk 
 Floating rate debt at October 31, 2024 and 2023 was zero for both periods. During the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company had no weighted average borrowings. The Company does not hedge these interest rate risks. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, it should be noted that a control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met and may not prevent all errors or instances of fraud. 
 The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended October 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is involved in legal proceedings and claims from time to time, in the ordinary course of its business. Legal reserves are recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies. Contingencies are inherently unpredictable and it is possible that results of operations, balance sheets or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in any particular period by unfavorable developments in, or resolution or disposition of, such matters. For those legal proceedings and claims for which the Company believes that it is probable that a reasonably estimable loss may result, the Company records a reserve for the potential loss. For proceedings and claims where the Company believes it is reasonably possible that a loss may result that is materially in excess of amounts accrued for the matter, the Company either discloses an estimate of such possible loss or range of loss or includes a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. 
 In December 2016, U.S. Customs and Border Protection U.S. Customs issued an audit report concerning the methodology used by the Company to allocate the cost of certain watch styles imported into the U.S. among the component parts of those watches for tariff purposes. The report disputed the reasonableness of the Company s historical allocation formulas and proposed an alternative methodology that would imply 5.1 million in underpaid duties for all imports that entered the United States during the audit period which extended from August 1, 2011 through July 15, 2016, plus possible penalties and interest. Although the Company believes that U.S. Customs alternative duty methodology and estimate were not consistent with the Company s facts and circumstances and consistently disputed U.S. Customs position, the Company previously established reserves for a portion of the alleged underpayment indicated in the audit report. Between February 2017 and January 2021, the Company made numerous submissions to U.S. Customs containing supplemental analyses and information in response to U.S. Customs information requests. On May 1, 2023, the statute of limitations lapsed with respect to all entries encompassed by the audit period. As a result, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company released the reserves that it had established in respect of those entries. 
 In addition to the above matters, the Company is involved in other legal proceedings and contingencies, the resolution of which is not expected to materially affect its financial condition, future results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 As of October 31, 2024, there have been no material changes to any of the risk factors previously reported in the Company s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 On November 23, 2021, the Board approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to 50.0 million of its outstanding common stock from time to time through November 23, 2024, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. On December 5, 2024, the Board approved an additional share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to 50.0 million of its outstanding common stock through December 5, 2027, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. Under both share repurchase programs, the Company is permitted to purchase shares of its common stock through open market purchases, repurchase plans, block trades or otherwise. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of 81,000 shares of its common stock under the November 23, 2021 share repurchase program at a total cost of 1.5 million, or an average of 19.03 per share. 
 At the election of an employee, upon the vesting of a stock award or the exercise of a stock option, shares of common stock having an aggregate value on the vesting of the award or the exercise date of the option, as the case may be, equal to the employee s withholding tax obligation may be surrendered to the Company by netting them from the vested shares issued. Similarly, shares having an aggregate value equal to the exercise price of an option may be tendered to the Company in payment of the option exercise price and netted from the shares of common stock issued upon the option exercise. An aggregate of 1,149 shares were repurchased during the three months ended October 31, 2024 as a result of the surrender of shares of common stock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards or stock options.
