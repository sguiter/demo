These statements reflect the current views of management with respect to future events and our financial performance. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding the estimated costs and expected benefits of the restructuring plan initiated in May 2024, including the additional actions taken under the restructuring plan in September 2024, product plans, future growth, sales estimates/Order Book numbers, market opportunities, strategic initiatives, industry positioning, customer acquisition and retention, revenue growth and anticipated impacts on our business of current worldwide economic uncertainty, inflation, monetary policy shifts, and other disruptions due to geopolitical conditions and global health emergencies. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as outlook, believes, expects, future, potential, continues, may, will, should, could, seeks, approximately, predicts, intends, plans, estimates, anticipates or the negative version of these words or other comparable words or phrases, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. 
 These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including our history of losses and our expectation that we will continue to incur significant expenses, including substantial R D costs, and continuing losses for the foreseeable future as well as our limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter; our strategic initiatives which may prove more costly than we currently anticipate and potential failure to increase our revenue to offset these initiatives; whether our LiDAR products are selected for inclusion in autonomous driving or Advanced Driving Assistance Systems ADAS by automotive original equipment manufacturers OEMs or their suppliers, and whether we will be de-selected by any customers; the lengthy period of time from a major commercial win to implementation and the risks of cancellation or postponement of the contract or unsuccessful implementation; potential inaccuracies in our forward looking estimates of certain metrics, including Order Book, our future cost of goods sold COGS and bill of materials BOM and total addressable market; the discontinuation, lack of success of our customers in developing and commercializing products using our solutions or loss of business with respect to a particular vehicle model or technology package and whether end automotive consumers will demand and be willing to pay for such features; our ability to successfully fund our growth if there are considerable delays in product introductions by us or our customers; our inability to reduce and control the cost of the inputs on which we rely, which could negatively impact the adoption of our products and our profitability; the effect of continued pricing pressures, competition from other LiDAR manufacturers, OEM cost reduction initiatives and the ability of automotive OEMs to re-source or cancel vehicle or technology programs which may result in lower than anticipated margins, or losses, which may adversely affect our business; the effect of general economic conditions, including inflation, recession risks and rising interest rates, generally and on our industry and us in particular, including the level of demand and financial performance of the autonomous vehicle industry and the decline in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities in a rising interest rate environment; market adoption of LiDAR as well as developments in alternative technology and the increasingly competitive environment in which we operate, which includes established competitors and market participants that have substantially greater resources; our ability to achieve technological feasibility and commercialize our software products and the requirement to continue to develop new products and product innovations due to rapidly changing markets and government regulations of such technologies; our ability to build, launch, receive regulatory approval, sell, and service insurance products as well as market and differentiate the benefits of LiDAR-based ADAS to consumers; our ability to manage our growth and expand our business operations effectively, including into international markets, such as China, which exposes us to operational, financial, regulatory and geopolitical risks; changes in our government contracts business and our defense customers business due to political change and global conflicts; adverse impacts due to limited availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers and single-source suppliers; the project-based nature of our orders, which can cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis; whether we will be able to successfully transition our engineering designs into high volume manufacturing, including our ability to transition to an outsourced manufacturing business model and whether we and our outsourcing partners and suppliers can successfully operate complex machinery; whether we can successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions; whether the complexity of our products results in undetected defects and reliability issues which could reduce market adoption of our new products, limit our ability to manufacture, damage our reputation and expose us to product liability, warranty and other claims; our ability to maintain and adequately manage our inventory; our ability to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights; availability of qualified personnel, loss of highly skilled personnel and dependence on Austin Russell, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; the impact of inflation and our stock price on our ability to hire and retain highly skilled personnel; the amount and timing of future sales and whether the average selling prices of our products could

 of the membership interests of EM4 from G H Investment Holding, Inc. G H ), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash, net of working capital adjustments, and up to million in contingent future payments to G H subject to the achievement of certain financial performance targets. The fair value of the contingent consideration at the Acquisition Date was estimated to be million. The Company utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the probability-weighted fair value of the contingent consideration. This transaction has been accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition related costs incurred as part of the transaction were not material. 
 Recording of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed 
 Price allocation includes preliminary estimates of deferred tax balances, certain tax liabilities, for which the Company is in the process of collecting documentation to ascertain potential amounts, and fair value of certain working capital components. Preliminary estimates of fair values included in the condensed consolidated financial statements are expected to be finalized

 Since the consideration paid by the Company to acquire EM4 s business was lower than the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, the Company recognized a million gain from the acquisition of EM4. The following factors contributed towards the purchase price paid by the Company being lower than the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired: (a) EM4 had historically been incurring losses; (b) G H viewed EM4 as non-core; (c) although G H pursued a competitive auction process for the business, the ultimate timeline to completion was drawn-out due to the complexity of the transaction structure; and (d) during the later stages of the sale process, after the Company was selected as the winning bidder, EM4 s business was impacted by the cancellation of certain material government programs as well as delays in certain other purchase orders, which also served to significantly reduce the estimated probability of the contingent future payments to G H. 
 The results of operations related to EM4 are included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations beginning from the Acquisition Date.

 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment charges of million and million related to goodwill and IPR D related to Freedom Photonics. These impairment charges were due to events that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023, including a decision to delay development activities on certain new products resulting from an increasing focus on supporting the product roadmap of the Autonomy Solutions segment, and a lowering of the growth outlook for the business due to less than anticipated traction in sales of new products.

 million and impairment charge has been recorded by the Autonomy Solutions reportable segment. 
 In relation to the goodwill, the Company engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. The Company assessed the fair value of the Freedom Photonics reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2024, using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The significant assumptions used in the assessment of the reporting unit included revenue growth rates, profit margins, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal value and a discount rate. As a result of this assessment, the Company determined in the fourth quarter of 2023 that the carrying value of the Freedom Photonics reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value by million. This resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill, with the remaining goodwill associated with Freedom Photonics being fully impaired in the third quarter of 2024.

 Granted Outstanding as of September 30, 2024 
 On November 8, 2023, the Board approved a formula for RSU grants to Messrs. Fennimore and Prescott for each year from 2024 through 2029 for Mr. Fennimore and through 2026 for Mr. Prescott based on achievement of annual performance goals with respect to the immediately preceding year Annual Performance Award ). The number of RSUs to be awarded in a year will be determined at the sole discretion of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee based on actual achievement of the annual performance goals established by the Board based on the Company s approved operating plan in respect of the immediately preceding year, with such awards ranging from RSUs at the threshold level, RSUs at the target level, and RSUs at the maximum level for extraordinary performance (interpolated linearly between target levels, as applicable). For a potential award to be made in 2024, the Compensation Committee had determined that annual performance goals will be weighted based on revenue and based on free cash flow, with target performance for the revenue performance goal equal to million and target performance for the 2023 fourth quarter free cash flow goal equal to ) million. In March 2024, the Compensation Committee determined that the achievement of the 2023 performance goals was below the threshold level. Accordingly, no 2023 Annual Performance Award was granted to Messrs. Fennimore and Prescott in March 2024.

 On March 21, 2024, a putative class action styled Smith v. Gores, et al., C.A. No. 2024-0285-MTZ (Del. Ch.) was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and the members of its Board of Directors. The lawsuit asserted claims on behalf of a putative class comprised of all stockholders other than defendants and any current directors or officers of the Company. The plaintiff alleged that certain provisions in the Company s advance notice bylaws (the Challenged Provisions were invalid and void and that the members of the Board have breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty by adopting and maintaining the Challenged Provisions. In addition to seeking declaratory, equitable, and injunctive relief, the plaintiff sought an award of attorneys fees and other costs and expenses on behalf of the putative class. On September 4, 2024, the court granted the parties stipulation to dismiss this action with prejudice, as to the individual plaintiff only, in light of certain amendments to the Challenged Provisions adopted by the Board, which rendered the action moot. The court retains jurisdiction of the action solely for the purpose of adjudicating an attorneys fees and expenses application by the plaintiff. The Company has determined that the likelihood of this matter resulting in a material adverse impact on the Company s financial results is remote.

 ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report and in Part II, Item 1A, of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (the Second Quarter 2024 Report and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a global automotive technology company ushering a new era of vehicle safety and autonomy. We are enabling solutions for series production passenger cars and commercial trucks as well as other targeted markets. Over the past decade, we have been building our light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor from the chip-level up, which is expected to meet the demanding performance, safety, reliability and cost requirements to enable next-generation safety and autonomous capabilities for passenger and commercial vehicles as well as other adjacent markets. 
 We are in the process of developing perception, decision-making and mapping software. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, most of our software products had not achieved technological feasibility. 
 Acquisition of EM4 
 On March 18, 2024, we completed the acquisition of EM4, a designer, manufacturer and seller of packaged photonic components and sub-systems for industrial markets. The EM4 acquisition is expected to accelerate our strategy to package lasers, detectors and ASICs. Operations of EM4 have been included in the ATS segment since the acquisition date. 
 
 Industrialization Update 
 We continue to execute on our industrialization plan in conjunction with our automaker partners. 
 We announced our start of production SOP for Volvo Cars at the manufacturing facility in Mexico in April 2024 and began shipping production LiDAR sensors for the Volvo EX90, with yields continuously improving during the third quarter of 2024. 
 We continually evaluate opportunities for optimizing our manufacturing processes and product design. During 2023, we began evaluating our sourcing strategy with the objective to reduce future per unit sensor manufacturing costs, and then finalized and committed to a plan to change our sourcing of certain sub-assemblies and components from one supplier to another, which will require us to abandon certain equipment located at the legacy supplier. As a result, we have reduced the useful lives of the long-lived assets within the impacted asset group in line with when these assets are expected to be abandoned. We expect the transition to new suppliers to be essentially completed in 2024. The reduction in the estimated useful lives of the impacted assets resulted in us recording 0.9 million and 4.4 million of accelerated depreciation charges in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to record additional accelerated depreciation of approximately 0.3 million through the remainder of 2024. Our continuing optimization of our manufacturing and product design processes may impact estimated useful lives or carrying values of additional property, plant and equipment or other assets. 
 Business Updates 
 On May 3, 2024, we announced a restructuring and cost reduction plan (the Restructuring Plan ), which included reducing our workforce by approximately 20 and sub-leasing of certain facilities. We estimated the impact of the Restructuring Plan and other actions such as contractor spend reduction, when completed, would reduce operating costs by approximately 50.0 million to 65.0 million on an annual basis, of which approximately 20.0 million to 30.0 million would be savings in cash expenditures. 
 On September 20, 2024, we announced additional actions under the Restructuring Plan that represent a cumulative workforce reduction of approximately 30 of our full-time employees since the beginning of 2024. These additional actions commenced immediately following the announcement, and we expect them to be substantially complete by the end of 2025. We expect to incur approximately 4.0 million to 6.0 million in additional cash charges associated with employee severance and related employee costs, plus charges related to acceleration of certain previously granted stock-based awards as part of severance packages for impacted employees. Through September 30, 2024, we incurred 9.5 million in total charges associated with employee severance and related costs, including both cash and stock from the actions we took in May 2024 and September 2024. We estimate that the additional workforce adjustments we announced in September 2024, along with other cost-saving measures expected to take place over the coming quarters, will generate approximately 80.0 million in additional annual cash savings on a run-rate basis. 
 On August 6, 2024, we entered into private, separately negotiated agreements for (i) the private offering and sale of 100 million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued, first-lien, senior secured floating rate notes due 2028 of the Company 
 36

 (the Senior Notes and (ii) the exchange of approximately 421.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25 2026 Convertible Senior Notes (due in 2026) for approximately 274.2 million in aggregate principal amount of 2023 Convertible Notes (due in 2030), consisting of two series of second-lien, senior secured notes, both of which have identical terms other than the principal amount, interest rate and applicable conversion price. We did not receive any cash proceeds from the exchange transaction. The transactions closed on August 8, 2024. See note 8 for more detail. 
 Given the customary business practices in the automotive industry, the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we compete and that LiDAR is new, there remains potential risk that our major commercial wins may not ultimately generate any significant revenue. See the discussion under the heading The period of time from a major commercial win to implementation is long and we are subject to risks of cancellation or postponement of the contract or unsuccessful implementation in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our business and revenue producing activities are organized in two operating segments: (i) Autonomy Solutions and (ii) Advanced Technologies and Services ATS ). 
 The Autonomy Solutions segment is engaged in the design, manufacturing, and sale of LiDAR sensors catering mainly to OEMs in the automobile, commercial vehicle, robotaxi and adjacent industries. The Autonomy Solutions segment revenue also includes fees earned from non-recurring engineering services provided to customers in connection with customization of our sensor and software products, as well as revenue generated from licensing of certain information. 
 The ATS segment provides advanced semiconductors and related components, as well as design, test and consulting services to the Autonomy Solutions segment and to various third-party customers, including government agencies and defense contractors, in markets generally unrelated to autonomous vehicles. 
 Two customers of the Autonomy Solutions segment, accounted for 34 and 17 , respectively, of the Company s revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. One customer of the Autonomy Solutions segment, accounted for 48 of the Company s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Three customers of the Autonomy Solutions segment, accounted for 32 , 14 and 14 , respectively, of the Company s revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Two customers of the Autonomy Solutions segment, accounted for 30 and 16 , respectively, of the Company s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Consideration Payable to Customers 
 The Company enters into revenue and purchase contracts with the same customer from time to time. When payments to customers are in exchange for distinct goods and services, the Company evaluates the underlying economics and fair value of the distinct goods and services. If the Company determines any portion of the consideration payable to the customer exceeds the fair value of the distinct goods and services, the excess is accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price of the revenue contract. 
 Cost of sales and gross profit (loss) 
 Cost of sales includes the fixed and variable manufacturing cost of our LiDAR sensors, which primarily consists of material purchases from third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers which are directly associated with our manufacturing process and personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense for personnel engaged in manufacturing, and engineering. Cost of sales also includes cost of providing services to customers, depreciation and amortization for manufacturing fixed assets or equipment, cost of components, product testing and launch-related costs, an allocated portion of overhead, facility and information technology IT costs, write downs for excess and obsolete inventory and shipping costs. 
 The ATS segment provides certain services and components to the Autonomy Solutions segment, which are recorded as cost of goods sold or research and development costs depending on the nature and use of such services and components by the Autonomy Solutions segment. These inter-segment transactions are eliminated in the consolidated results. 
 Gross profit (loss) equals revenue less cost of sales. As we transition from prototype production to series production, average selling prices will be lower and we expect these lower average selling prices to temporarily increase our gross loss over the next few quarters until we start to realize the benefits of cost reduction and efficiency measures and production scaling.

 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development (R D) 
 R D costs are expensed as incurred. Design and development costs for products to be sold under long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred. Design and development costs for molds, dies, and other tools involved in developing new technologies are expensed as incurred. 
 Our R D efforts are focused on enhancing and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development, including new releases and upgrades to our LiDAR sensors and integrated software solutions. R D expenses consist primarily of: 
 Personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and engineering functions; 
 Expenses related to materials, software licenses, supplies and third-party services; 
 Prototype expenses; and 
 An allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. 
 The ATS segment provides certain services and components to the Autonomy Solutions segment, which are recorded as cost of goods sold or research and development costs depending on the nature and use of such services and components by the Autonomy Solutions segment. These inter-segment transactions are eliminated in our consolidated results. We expect our R D costs to remain elevated for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities to achieve our product roadmap, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the foreseeable future due to continued R D investments. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation of our business development team, as well as advertising and marketing expenses. These include the cost of marketing programs, trade shows, promotional materials, demonstration equipment, an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation of our executive, finance, human resources, information systems and legal departments as well as legal and accounting fees for professional and contract services. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 
 The derivatives are classified as marked-to-market liabilities and the corresponding increase or decrease in value is reflected in change in fair value of embedded derivatives. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Interest income consists of income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities. These amounts will vary based on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, and also with market rates. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes and Senior Notes as well as amortization of premium (discount) on marketable securities. Other income (expense) includes realized gains and losses related to the marketable securities, as well as impact of gains and losses related to foreign exchange transactions.

 The decrease in revenue of 1.5 million in our Autonomy Solutions in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower service revenue on certain NRE contracts. The 4.4 million increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increase in sensor shipments to Volvo and licensing of certain information partially offset by lower service revenue on certain NRE contracts. 
 The increase in revenue of our ATS segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from the acquisition of EM4 partially offset by non-recurring engineering service and product sales.

 The 5.6 million decrease in the cost of sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to reduction in launch related costs as we prepared for series production of Iris. The 7.7 million decrease in the cost of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was

Table of Contents 

 primarily due to cost reduction actions in the last two quarters, launch related costs in prior year and lower number of service projects offset by ramp up in production and units sold. 
 In 2023, we finalized and committed to a plan to proceed with a change in our sourcing strategy for certain manufacturing activities. Implementation of this plan is expected to result in discontinued use of certain plant, property and equipment assets as they will no longer be needed for their original intended use. As a result of executing our plan, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain long-lived assets within the impacted asset group. This resulted in recording depreciation for these assets over an accelerated period. We recorded 0.9 million and 4.4 million of incremental accelerated depreciation charges associated with this manufacturing and sourcing change in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 The 12.3 million and 15.3 million decrease in research and development expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to: 
 a 6.6 million and 13.7 million net decrease in personnel-related costs driven mainly by decreased headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense; offset by 
 a 5.7 million and 1.6 million net increase in purchased materials, contractor fees and external spend in relation to continuing development and testing of our sensor and software products, development activities related to advanced manufacturing as well as data labeling services. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 The 1.3 million and 4.0 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to decreases in personnel related costs including stock-based compensation costs due to decreased headcount and reduction in travel related costs. 
 General and Administrative 
 The 5.2 million and 29.3 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to: 
 a 8.2 million and 24.5 million net decrease in personnel-related costs driven mainly by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense as a result of headcount reduction and vesting of certain awards previously granted in connection with M A activity; 
 a 1.0 million and 2.9 million decrease in travel related costs; and 
 a 4.0 million net increase and 1.9 million net decrease in computer and software subscriptions, contractor fees and external spend. 
 Impairment of goodwill and intangible and intangible assets 
 During the third quarter of 2024 the Company recognized additional impairment charges of 3.4 million and 3.3 million related to goodwill and IPR D, related to Freedom Photonics driven by a slower industry lidar adoption rate in the near-term as well as a reduction in the Freedom Photonics workforce assigned to perform development work for external customers. 
 Restructuring Costs 
 The Company incurred 3.3 million and 9.5 million in restructuring expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to actions taken pursuant to the Restructuring Plan announced in May 2024. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities is a non-cash benefit or charge due to the corresponding decrease or increase in the estimated fair value of warrants issued in a private placement in connection with the initial public offering of Gores Metropoulos, Inc. Private Warrants ). 
 The non-cash gain related to the Private Warrants was 0.1 million and 1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gain on Extinguishment of Debt 
 As a result of the exchange and purchase transactions, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a 147.3 million gain on debt extinguishment which represented the difference between the carrying value of the 2026 
 40

 Convertible Senior Notes so exchanged and the collective fair value of 2030 Convertible Notes and the Senior Notes, net of the cash payment received from the investors, along with the gain from the 2030 Convertible Notes principal amount conversion initiated by the holders. The extinguishment gain was recorded in Other income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 
 The change in fair value of derivative liability is a non-cash benefit or charge due to the corresponding decrease or increase in the estimated fair value of embedded derivatives in the 2030 Convertible Notes. 
 Segment Operating Income or Loss 
 Segment income or loss is defined as income or loss before taxes. Our segment income or loss breakdown is as follows (in thousands):

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity and Capital Requirements 
 Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 production capacity and volume; 
 the timing and extent of spending to support R D efforts; 
 investments in manufacturing equipment and facilities; 
 the expansion of sales and marketing activities, market adoption of new and enhanced products and features; and 
 investments in information technology systems. 
 Until we can generate sufficient revenue and profits from sale of products and services to cover our operating expenses, working capital, and capital expenditures, we expect our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and proceeds from debt and/or equity financings to fund our cash needs. If we are required to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders would result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. In addition, we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase material amounts of our outstanding debt securities through open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, for cash or through exchanges for debt or equity, subject to limitations in the agreements governing our outstanding debt securities. Any repurchases or exchanges would be on terms and at prices that we may determine in our discretion and would depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, our receipt of any necessary corporate approvals and other factors. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of uncertainty that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. 
 We expect to continue to invest in our product and software development as well as incur efforts to build customer relations and markets. Further, we expect to invest in developing advanced manufacturing capabilities, both, internally as well as with our contract manufacturing partners. We expect to fund these product and business development initiatives and capital expenditures either through our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities or through issuance of shares of our Class A common stock to vendors and third parties for services provided Stock-in-lieu of Cash Program ). 
 In February 2024, we entered into two non-recourse loan and securities pledge agreements (the Loan Agreements with The St. James Bank Trust Company Ltd. (the Lender ), pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate of 50.0 million. Any loans made by the Lender under the Loan Agreements would be collateralized by shares of our Class A common stock or stock we hold of another company. The Loan Agreements require us to pay an up-front structure fee of 1.5 on any amounts borrowed, and any outstanding amounts would bear interest at 8.0 per annum. We did not borrow any amount from this credit facility and had no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. 
 On May 3, 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the 2024 Sales Agreement with Virtu Americas LLC (the Agent under which we may offer and sell, from time to time in our sole discretion, shares of our Class A common stock with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to 150.0 million under the Equity Financing Program. This was an extension of the prior Equity Financing Program we established with the Agent in February 2023. In August 2024, the Company increased the Equity Financing Program by an additional 50.0 million pursuant to the 2024 Sales Agreement. We intend to use the net proceeds 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 from offerings under the Equity Financing Program for expenditures or payments in connection with strategic merger and acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships and similar transactions, repurchases of convertible debt securities, and if needed, for general corporate and business purposes. 
 Under the 2024 Sales Agreement, we set the parameters for the sale of the shares, including the number of shares to be issued, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, limitations on the number of shares that may be sold in any one trading day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2024 Sales Agreement, the Agent has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, to sell the shares by methods deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, including sales made through The Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
 We issued 4,000,000 and 24,001,276 shares of Class A common stock under the Equity Financing Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for net proceeds of 5.9 million and 41.8 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 182.1 million was available for sale under the program. 
 In August 2024, we entered into private, separately negotiated agreements for (i) the private offering and sale of 100 million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued, first-lien, senior secured floating rate notes due 2028 and (ii) the exchange of approximately 421.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25 Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 for approximately 274.2 million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2030. We received 100 million in cash proceeds from the offering and sale of the Senior Notes, but did not receive any cash proceeds from the exchange of the Convertible Senior Notes for the 2030 Convertible Notes. As a result of this transaction, we extended a significant amount of our 2026 maturities into 2030 and raised additional capital to bolster our liquidity position. We expect to incur higher annual interest expense for the incremental Senior Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes. For additional information regarding the Senior Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes, including the financial and other restrictive covenants and contractual obligations contained in the indentures governing the Senior Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes, see Note 8 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 During the quarter ending September 30, 2024, 22.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2030 Convertible Notes were converted by the holders. the Company issued 20,361,266 shares of Class A common stock to settle the conversion of 22.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2030 Convertible Notes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 114.2 million and marketable securities of 84.4 million, totaling 198.6 million of total liquidity. To date, our principal sources of liquidity have been proceeds received from issuances of debt and equity. Market and economic conditions, such as the increase in interest rates by federal agencies, may materially impact relative cost and mix of these sources of liquidity. 
 To date, we have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities and have incurred significant losses from operations in the past as reflected in our accumulated deficit of 2.1 billion as of September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the foreseeable future due to continued R D investments that we intend to make in our business and, as a result, we may require additional capital resources to grow our business. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to continue to execute our business strategy in the next 12 months.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We believe our critical accounting policies involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity and have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Except as set forth below, there were no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates included in our 2023 Annual Report during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to our 2023 Annual Report and Note 2 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 Convertible and Senior Notes and Derivative Liability 
 We evaluate the convertible and senior notes to determine if embedded features of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s Own Equity. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date as components of convertible and senior notes. The change in the fair value during the period is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as either other income or expense as changes in fair value of derivative liability. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 We use a binomial lattice bond model to estimate the fair value of the senior notes, convertible notes, and embedded derivatives. Our use of the binomial model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, discount rates, and estimated effective conversion price ratios based on forecasted financial metrics (adjusted for additional interest payment upon conversion per the agreement). The assumptions used in the binomial model represent managements best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. 
 
 Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 Based on the Company's public float as of June 28, 2024, and its revenue, the Company has transitioned to Smaller Reporting Company status and plans to take advantage of certain reduced disclosure requirements.

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed, and were effective, to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Information with respect to this Item may be found under the heading Legal Matters in Note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. 
 The Company is supplementing the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of its 2023 Annual Report to update the following risk factor appearing under the heading Risk Factors Risks Related to Ownership of Our Shares. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the Risk Factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, our 2023 Annual Report and in Part II, Item 1A, of our Second Quarter 2024 Report. You should carefully consider the Risk Factors discussed in our 2023 Annual Report and Second Quarter 2024 Report, as supplemented below, as they could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results of operations. 
 Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our securities. 
 Our Class A common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, which has qualitative and quantitative continued listing requirements, including corporate governance requirements, public float requirements, and a 1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement. 
 On October 15, 2024, we received written notice from Nasdaq notifying us that we are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq listing rule 5450(a)(1) for continued listing on Nasdaq (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). Nasdaq listing rule 5450(a)(1) requires listed securities maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share, and Nasdaq listing rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum closing bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the written notice, we did not meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days within 180 days of the notice date, or by April 14, 2025, which may be extended if certain conditions are met. Since the date of the notice letter from Nasdaq, our common stock has failed to maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive business days. 
 At a special meeting of stockholders held on October 30, 2024, our stockholders approved, in connection with our failure to satisfy the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, a reverse stock split of our common stock prior to December 31, 2024, at a ratio ranging from 1:5 to 1:20, with the ratio to be determined by the Board. On November 13, 2024, the Board set and approved a ratio of 1-for-15 for the reverse stock split and authorized management to proceed with the reverse stock split. Although we expect that the reverse stock split will have the immediate effect of increasing the market price of our common stock to above 1.00, we cannot guarantee that the reverse stock split will result in the trading price of our common stock remaining above the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, or that the reverse stock split will result in a long-term increase in the market price of our common stock, which would be dependent on many factors, including general economic, market and industry conditions, our business and other factors. 
 If we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, or if we are unable to satisfy any of the other continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our Class A common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of the securities and would impair the ability of stockholders to sell or purchase their securities. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained. Delisting would also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our continuing operations. In addition, delisting would constitute a fundamental change under the indentures that govern our convertible notes, which could result in our being required to repurchase our convertible notes and other outstanding indebtedness. See the risk factor entitled "We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our existing and other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the notes or pay cash upon their conversion" in Part II, Item 1A, of our Second Quarter 2024 Report. 
 
 ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 On July 5, 2024, we issued 259,246 shares of Class A common stock in lieu of cash to a certain service provider for services rendered to us pursuant to a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
