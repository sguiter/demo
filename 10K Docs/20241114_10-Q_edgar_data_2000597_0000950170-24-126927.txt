Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include statements as to: 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of the Asset-Backed Finance Assets (as defined below) we acquire, control and manage; 

our ability to raise sufficient capital to execute our acquisition and lending strategies; 

the ability of the Operating Manager (as defined below) to source adequate acquisition and lending opportunities to efficiently deploy capital; 

the ability of our Asset-Backed Finance Assets to achieve their objectives; 

our current and expected financing arrangements; 

changes in the general interest rate environment; 

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 

the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our Asset-Backed Finance Assets; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Operating Manager or any of its affiliates; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we acquire, control and manage Asset-Backed Finance Assets; 

our use of financial leverage; 

the ability of the Operating Manager to identify, acquire and manage our Asset-Backed Finance Assets; 

the ability of the Operating Manager or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our ability to structure acquisitions in a tax-efficient manner and the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; and 

the tax status of the enterprises through which we acquire, control and manage Asset-Backed Finance Assets. 

In addition, words such as anticipate, believe, expect and intend and similar words or variations thereof may indicate a forward-looking statement, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including factors outside of our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including our latest registration statement on Form 10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
 i 

amended (the Registration Statement ). Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: 
 changes in the economy; 

risks associated with possible disruption in our operations or the economy generally due to terrorism, natural disasters, epidemics or other events having a broad impact on the economy; and 

future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in our operating areas. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the organizational expenses and expense support from Operating Manager for Series I and Series II include a reallocation of the previous year's Series I organizational expenses and expense support from Operating Manager to Series II. This reallocation is associated with Apollo's investment in Series II on May 3, 2024.

Thereafter all organizational expenses and expense support from Operating Manager are recorded between Series I and Series II using the allocation methodology described in the "Basis of Presentation" section above. Offering expenses include registration fees and legal fees regarding the preparation of the initial registration statement.

, and , respectively. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the fair value of foreign currencies. In a foreign currency forward contract, the Company agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of one currency for another at a pre-determined price at a future date. Foreign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market at the applicable forward rate. Depending on the nature of the balance, the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are recorded within derivative assets, at fair value or derivative liabilities, at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Any cash collateral amounts posted to or received from the counterparty to cover collateral obligations under the terms of the foreign currency forward contracts are included in prepaid expenses and other assets or other accrued expenses and liabilities, respectively, on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Purchases and settlements of foreign currency forward contracts having the same settlement date and counterparty are generally settled net and any realized gains or losses are recognized on the settlement date. The Company does not utilize hedge accounting with respect to foreign currency forward contracts and as such, the Company recognizes its foreign currency forward contracts at fair value with changes included in the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Operations . The Company uses credit default swap (" CDS ") contracts whereby the buyer of the credit default swaps contract agrees to pay a specified fixed charge to the seller of the CDS contract in return for the right to put the debt of the debtor named in the CDS contract to the seller of the CDS contract at par value of the referred debt instrument in the event of a "credit event" as defined by the CDS contract which may include, but is not limited to, bankruptcy of the debtor or when the debtor defaults in payment. The buyer's obligation under the CDS contract is fixed at the date the contract is entered into. The seller's potential liability under the CDS contract is open-ended and can be equal to the entire notional amount of the contract. Depending on the nature of the balance, the fair value of credit default swap contracts are recorded within derivative assets, at fair value or derivative liabilities, at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Any cash collateral amounts posted to or received from the counterparty to cover collateral obligations under the terms of the credit default swap contracts are included in prepaid expenses and other assets or other accrued expenses and liabilities, respectively, on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The Company does not utilize hedge accounting with respect to CDS contracts and as such, the Company recognizes its CDS contracts at fair value with changes included in the net change in unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Operations .

Distributions Beginning with the end of the first full calendar quarter in which the Shares are sold to non-affiliates of Apollo, the Company will seek to declare, accrue and pay quarterly distributions. However, there is no guarantee that Series I or Series II will pay quarterly distributions consistently and at a specific rate, or at all. There were distributions declared for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Distribution Reinvestment Plan The Company adopted a distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP ), in which cash distributions to shareholders will automatically be reinvested in additional whole and fractional shares attributable to the type of Shares that a shareholder owns unless and until an election is made on behalf of such participating shareholder to withdraw from the DRIP and receive distributions in cash.

t issued any Shares under the DRIP. Share Repurchases The Company offers a share repurchase plan pursuant to which, on a quarterly basis, shareholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their Shares. The Company may repurchase fewer Shares than have been requested in any particular quarter to be repurchased under the Company s share repurchase plan, or none at all, in the Board s discretion at any time. We expect that each Series will conduct quarterly Share repurchases (each, a "Share Repurchase") for up to of the aggregate NAV of our outstanding Investor Shares and E Shares of each Series (measured across both Series) at a price based on the NAV per Share as of the last business day of the quarter prior to the commencement of a Share Repurchase. The Company expects to make Share Repurchases beginning with the second full quarter after the initial raising of third-party capital.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Fina ncial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Annual Report. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report. 
 Overview 
 The Company was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on September 22, 2023. The Company commenced operations on May 3, 2024 and was formed to acquire, control and manage Asset-Backed Finance Assets globally. The Company formed separate Series pursuant to the LLC Act, and although the IRS has only issued proposed regulations relating to series entities, each Series is intended to be treated as a separate entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although the Series are separate legal entities, they are expected to invest, directly or indirectly, in the same Asset-Backed Finance Assets on a pro rata basis, with equal voting rights with respect thereto. While it is the Company s intention that the Series will generally hold pro rata economic interests in each Asset-Backed Finance Asset, such economic interests may not be pro rata in all instances. The Company expects that deviations from this pro rata holding intention would be a result of cash flows into the Series and different tax obligations between the Series. The Series will conduct the business of the Company jointly and although they have the ability and intention to contract in their own names, they expect to do so jointly and in coordination with one another. Neither Series will have directors, officers or employees, but will be overseen by the Board and managed by the Operating Manager. As a Delaware limited liability company with two different series, to the extent the records maintained for a Series account for the assets associated with a Series separately from the assets of the Company or any other Series, the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to such Series are segregated and enforceable only against the assets of such Series and not the assets of the Company generally or of any other Series, as provided under Delaware law. Each of Series I and Series II is intended to be treated as a separate entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Series I has elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and Series II is intended to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The state tax treatment of a limited liability company, and of different series in a series limited liability company, depends on the laws of each state. Although there is no direct authority on point, we generally expect that the vast majority of states will follow the U.S. federal tax treatment. However, it is possible that a state may classify Series I and/or Series II differently than the IRS does for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The state tax treatment of a series limited liability company depends on the laws of each state, and it is possible that a particular state may treat Series I and Series II as a single entity for state tax purposes or may treat Series I or Series II as separate entities but classified differently than the IRS does for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Consistent with Apollo s broader approach to investing, ABC pursues a disciplined, value-oriented approach to building a portfolio of Asset-Backed Finance Assets. The Company deploys capital across a spectrum of Asset-Backed Finance Assets to maximize relative value and generate attractive risk-adjusted rates of return in all market environments. None of Apollo s results can be attributed to the Company and there is no guarantee of similar results for the Company. 
 ABC employs an acquisition approach centered around Asset-Backed Finance Assets across five key pillars: (1) consumer finance, (2) residential mortgage loans, (3) commercial real estate, (4) financial assets and (5) hard assets. We believe we can focus on where the best risk-adjusted opportunities lie at any given point in time and consistently execute on compelling opportunities at attractive valuations. 
 We fund, finance and structure Asset-Backed Finance Assets across our five key pillars. We rely on Apollo s asset-backed finance platform to source and manage these Asset-Backed Finance Assets. Our executive officers, with the assistance of our Operating Manager, are responsible for making capital allocation decisions proposed by the Operating Manager and overseeing the management of the Company. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which requires the use of estimates, assumptions and the exercise of subjective judgment as to future uncertainties. Our financial statements are prepared using the accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies ASC Topic 946 ). 
 24 

Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily from the management of our Asset-Backed Finance Assets held through our subsidiaries and to a lesser extent strategic opportunities in Asset-Backed Finance Assets, which may consist of interest income, net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of Asset-Backed Finance Assets. 
 Series I, Series II and the Company generated revenues of 256, 1344, and 1600, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which includes interest income of 234, 1,186 and 1,420, respectively, (5), 13 and 8 of net unrealized depreciation, respectively, and 27, 145, 172 of net realized gains, respectively, on Asset-Backed Finance Assets and derivatives over the period. 
 Expenses 
 The below description of expenses applies with respect to each Series and is the same for each Series unless otherwise indicated. 
 Management Fee 
 Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Operating Manager is entitled to receive a management fee Management Fee ). The Management Fee is payable monthly in arrears in an amount equal to (i) 1.00 per annum of the month-end NAV attributable to S Shares and I Shares, (ii) 0.85 per annum of the month-end NAV attributable to the Founder Shares, (iii) 1.00 per annum of the month-end NAV attributable to the P-S Shares and P-I Shares commencing six months after the initial closing of third-party capital through an intermediary designated in the Company s sole discretion, whose clients are offered P-S Shares and P-I Shares P Share Intermediary ), (iv) 0.80 per annum of the month-end NAV attributable to the A-I Shares from inception through December 31, 2027 and 0.85 per annum of the month-end NAV attributable to the A-I Shares thereafter and (v) 0.75 per annum of the month-end NAV attributable to the A-II Shares; provided that this Management Fee will be reduced by any applicable Special Fees; provided, however, that this Management Fee will not be reduced for any Other Fees. In calculating the Management Fee, we will use our NAV before giving effect to accruals for the Management Fee, Performance Fee, combined annual distribution fee and shareholder servicing fee or distributions payable on our Shares. We do not pay the Operating Manager a Management Fee on the Apollo Shares, and as a result, it is an expense specific only to Investor Shares at the rates specified herein, which will result in the dilution of Investor Shares in proportion to the fees charged to different types of Investor Shares and will result in differences in NAV among the types of Shares. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Operating Manager earned Management Fees of 23, 35, and 58 for Series I, Series II, and the Company, respectively. 
 Selling Commissions and Ongoing Distribution and Servicing Fees 
 Apollo Global Securities, LLC (the Dealer Manager or AGS is entitled to receive selling commissions of up to 3.0 , and dealer manager fees of up to 0.5 , of the transaction price of each S Share, F-S Share and P-S Share. Any participating broker-dealers are compensated from such amounts by reallowance from the Dealer Manager; provided that the sum of such reallowed amounts and the selling commissions do not exceed 3.5 of the transaction price. The Dealer Manager will receive a combined annual distribution fee and shareholder servicing fee of 0.85 per annum of the aggregate NAV of the Company s outstanding S Shares and F-S Shares and 0.25 per annum of the aggregate NAV of the Company s outstanding P-S Shares. There will not be a combined annual distribution fee and shareholder servicing fee, upfront selling commission or dealer manager fee with respect to the Anchor Shares, I Shares, P-I Shares or F-I Shares, which will result in differences in NAV from the types of Shares that do bear such fees. The Dealer Manager anticipates that all or a portion of selling commissions and dealer manager fees will be reallowed to participating broker-dealers. 
 Apollo Shares will not incur any upfront selling costs or ongoing servicing costs. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, neither Series paid the Dealer Manager for any annual distribution fees, shareholder servicing fees, upfront selling commissions or dealer manager fees. 
 Special Fees 
 100 of any net consulting (including management consulting) or monitoring fees (including any early termination fee or acceleration of any such management consulting fee on a one-time basis that is approved by the Board), break-up fees (including, if applicable, the portion thereof described in the Annual Report under Item 1A. Risk Factors Additional Risks Related to the Operation of the Company Generally Our business may be affected by offering Co-Investments or opportunities to provide debt financing to any person ), directors fees, closing fees and merger and acquisition transaction advisory services fees related to the 
 25 

negotiation of the structuring of an Asset-Backed Finance Asset (other than debt investments or investments with respect to which Apollo does not exercise direct control with respect to the decision to engage the services giving rise to the relevant fees, costs and expenses) and similar fees (including bridge financing fees), whether in cash or in kind, including options, warrants and other non-cash consideration paid to the Operating Manager or any of its affiliates or any employees of the foregoing in connection with actual or contemplated acquisitions or investments (and allocable to the Company) (collectively, Special Fees that are allocable to those shareholders who bear Management Fees, will be applied to reduce the Management Fees paid by such Management Fee-bearing shareholders. As such, the portion of such Special Fees attributable to Apollo s investment or to the investments of shareholders that do not pay Management Fees will be retained by Apollo. In practice, the only fees that are expected to be accrued and would be paid and treated as Special Fees are mergers and acquisition transaction fees payable in connection with an acquisition and management consulting fees payable thereafter. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 there were no Special Fees allocable to the Company that were received by an affiliate of the Operating Manager. 
 Performance Fee 
 So long as the Operating Agreement has not been terminated, the Operating Manager is entitled to receive a Performance Fee equal to (i) 10.0 of the Total Return (as defined below) with respect to S Shares, I Shares, P-S Shares or P-I Shares, (ii) 7.5 of the Total Return with respect to F-S Shares or F-I Shares, (iii) 5.0 of the Total Return from inception through December 31, 2027 and 7.5 thereafter with respect to A-I Shares and (iv) 5.0 of the Total Return with respect to A-II Shares, in each case, subject to a 5.0 Hurdle Amount and a High Water Mark with respect to such type of Shares, with a Catch-Up (each term as defined below) (the Performance Fee ). Such fee will be paid annually and accrue monthly. The Performance Fee is not paid on Apollo Shares, and as a result, it is an expense specific only to Investor Shares at the rates specified herein, which will result in the dilution of Investor Shares in proportion to the fees charged to different types of Investor Shares and will result in differences in NAV among the types of Shares. 
 Specifically, the Operating Manager will be entitled to receive a Performance Fee in an amount equal to: 
 First, if the Total Return with respect to S Shares, I Shares, P-S Shares, P-I Shares, F-S Shares, F-I Shares, A-I Shares and A-II Shares for the applicable period exceeds the sum, with respect to such relevant type of Shares, of (i) the Hurdle Amount for that period and (ii) the Loss Carryforward Amount (as defined below) (any such excess, Excess Profits ), 100 of such Excess Profits until the total amount allocated to the Operating Manager with respect to such type of Shares equals 10.0 (with respect to S Shares, I Shares, P-S Shares or P-I Shares), 7.5 (with respect to F-S Shares or F-I Shares), 5.0 from inception through December 31, 2027 and 7.5 thereafter (with respect to A-I Shares) and 5.0 (with respect to A-II Shares) of the sum of (x) the Hurdle Amount with respect to such type of Shares for that period and (y) any amount allocated to the Operating Manager with respect to such type of Shares pursuant to this clause (this is commonly referred to as a Catch-Up and 

Second, to the extent there are remaining Excess Profits, (i) with respect to S Shares, I Shares, P-S Shares or P-I Shares, 10.0 of such remaining Excess Profits, (ii) with respect to F-S Shares or F-I Shares, 7.5 of such remaining Excess Profits, (iii) 5.0 from inception through December 31, 2027 and 7.5 thereafter with respect of A-I Shares and (iv) 5.0 with respect to A-II Shares. 

Total Return with respect to any Shares for any period since the end of the prior calendar year shall equal the sum of: 
 (i) all distributions accrued or paid (without duplication) on such Shares plus 

(ii) the change in aggregate NAV of such Shares since the beginning of the year, before giving effect to (w) applicable taxes for the year, (x) changes resulting solely from the proceeds of issuances of additional Shares, (y) any fee/accrual to the Performance Fee and (z) applicable combined annual distribution fee and shareholder servicing fee expenses (including any payments made to us for payment of such expenses) allocable to such Shares. 

For the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of Total Return will (i) include any appreciation or depreciation in the NAV of any relevant Shares issued during the then-current calendar year but (ii) exclude the proceeds from the initial issuance of such Shares. 
 Hurdle Amount with respect to any Shares means, for any period during a calendar year, that amount that results in a 5.0 annualized internal rate of return on the NAV of such Shares outstanding at the beginning of the then-current calendar year and such Shares issued since the beginning of the then-current calendar year, taking into account the timing and amount of all distributions accrued or paid (without duplication) on all such Shares and all issuances of any such Shares over the period and calculated in accordance with recognized industry practices. The ending NAV of such Shares used in calculating the internal rate of return will be 
 26 

calculated before giving effect to any fee/accrual to the Performance Fee and applicable combined annual distribution fee and shareholder servicing fee expenses and applicable taxes; provided that the calculation of the Hurdle Amount for any period will exclude any such Shares repurchased during such period, which Shares will be subject to the Performance Fee upon repurchase. 
 Loss Carryforward Amount with respect to any Shares shall initially equal zero and shall cumulatively increase by the absolute value of any negative annual Total Return with respect to such Shares and decrease by any positive annual Total Return with respect to such Shares; provided that each Loss Carryforward Amount shall at no time be less than zero; provided, further, that the calculation of each Loss Carryforward Amount will exclude the Total Return related to any relevant Shares repurchased during such year, which Shares will be subject to the Performance Fee upon repurchase. The effect of the Loss Carryforward Amount is that the recoupment of past annual Total Return losses will offset the positive annual Total Return for purposes of the calculation of the Operating Manager s Performance Fee. This is referred to as a High Water Mark. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Operating Manager accrued Performance Fees of 10, 18, and 28 for Series I, Series II, and the Company, respectively. 
 Other Fees 
 From time to time, the Operating Manager or its affiliates (including Atlas Securitized Products, other service providers affiliated with Apollo and other affiliates and portfolio companies of Apollo, Athene and other Apollo Clients (collectively, Affiliated Service Providers )) provide services to certain persons or entities, including the Company and the Series, potential and existing Asset-Backed Finance Assets (including with respect to the Company s acquisitions thereof). For example, an insurance company owned by an Apollo Client and/or alternative investment vehicles, could provide insurance products and services to the Company. Fees are retained by, and for the benefit of, the Operating Manager and/or such affiliates and Affiliated Service Providers, and are in most instances not applied to reduce the Management Fee. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, an Asset-Backed Finance Asset may, on such terms as such Asset-Backed Finance Asset determines to be in its best interest, provide services to another Asset-Backed Finance Asset or Apollo Client (or receive services from another Asset-Backed Finance Asset or Apollo Client), and may pay or receive related compensation, without the approval of the Board or any investor of the Company. 
 Other Fees means: 
 (i) fees, costs and expenses that comprise or constitute Organizational and Offering Expenses or Operating Expenses (defined below); 

(ii) salary, fees, expenses or other compensation of any nature paid by an Asset-Backed Finance Asset to any individual (or to the Operating Manager or any of its affiliates with respect to such individual) who acts as an officer of, or in an active management role at, such Asset-Backed Finance Asset (including industry executives, advisors, consultants (including operating consultants and sourcing consultants)), operating executives, subject matter experts or other persons acting in a similar capacity engaged or employed by Apollo; 

(iii) without limiting the foregoing items (i) and (ii), fees, costs or expenses paid to or in respect of Apollo or any industry executives, advisors, consultants (including operating consultants and sourcing consultants), operating executives, subject matter experts or other persons acting in a similar capacity who provide services to the Company or its Asset-Backed Finance Assets (including allocable overhead or other amounts or compensation of Apollo, including all costs and expenses on account of compensation and benefits of its employees); 

(iv) payments, fees, costs, expenses and other liabilities, allocable overhead or other amounts or compensation (such as arranger, brokerage, placement, syndication, solicitation, underwriting, agency, origination, sourcing, group purchasing, structuring, collateral management, special purpose vehicle (including any special purpose vehicle of an Asset-Backed Finance Asset), capital markets syndication and advisory fees (including underwriting and debt advisory fees) or subsidiary management or administration, operation, asset service, advisory, commitment, facility, float, insurance or other fees, discounts, retainers, spreads, commissions and concessions or other fees associated with the effectuation of any securities or financing transactions, but not merger and acquisition transaction advisory services fees related to the negotiation of the acquisition of an Asset-Backed Finance Asset) earned by or paid (whether in cash or in kind) to an Affiliated Service Provider, or another person with respect to services rendered by such Affiliated Service Provider or other person; provided that if such Affiliated Service Provider is engaged in the relevant activity or service on a for-profit basis, as determined by the Operating Manager in good faith, then, unless approved by the Board, the applicable fees paid to it for such services will be on terms as determined by the Operating Manager which the Operating Manager 

27 

determines are not materially less favorable to the Company or the applicable Asset-Backed Finance Asset than the fees that could be paid to a third party with commensurate skill, expertise or experience (to the extent applicable), in each case, as determined by the Operating Manager in good faith; 

(v) amounts earned by or for the account of any Apollo Client (directly or indirectly through an expense offset mechanism); 

(vi) fees, costs and expenses for any and all services whatsoever (including merger and acquisition transaction advisory services fees related to the negotiation of the structuring of an investment) paid or otherwise borne by any Asset-Backed Finance Asset or issuer of any securities or other financial instruments that constitute debt opportunities or opportunities with respect to which the Operating Manager does not exercise control with respect to the decision to engage the services giving rise to such fees, costs and expenses; 

(vii) fees, costs and expenses or other amounts or compensation earned by any person or otherwise borne with respect to Asset-Backed Finance Assets or transactions that are otherwise consented to or approved by a committee of the Board s independent directors; it being understood that in connection with obtaining such consent or approval, the Operating Manager will furnish or make available to the Board all material information, then actually known and available to the Operating Manager, that the Operating Manager determines in good faith is reasonably necessary for the Board to provide such consent or approval on a reasonably informed basis; 

(viii) any fees, costs or expenses paid to any Affiliated Service Provider, including where such fees, costs or expenses are structured as a performance fee; 

(ix) fees, costs and expenses or other amounts or compensation (including management fees, operating expenses and performance fees) earned by any person or otherwise borne with respect to Asset-Backed Finance Assets managed by the Operating Manager or any of its affiliates that are acquired by the Company in the secondary market; and 

(x) any fees, costs or expenses determined by the Operating Manager in good faith to be similar in nature to any of the foregoing.

 Operating Expenses 
 Each Series pays or otherwise bears its proportionate portion of the operating expenses. Operating expenses includes payments, fees, costs and expenses and other liabilities and obligations resulting from, related to, associated with, arising from or incurred in connection with the Company s operations (collectively, the Operating Expenses ). For all purposes of the definition of Operating Expenses, references therein to payments, fees, costs, expenses and other liabilities related to, associated with, arising from or incurred in connection with, an Asset-Backed Finance Asset includes all payments, fees, costs, expenses and other liabilities related to, associated with, arising from or incurred in connection with, potential or unconsummated Asset-Backed Finance Assets. Each Series will also bear any other fees, costs and expenses and other liabilities that arise in connection with an unconsummated Asset-Backed Finance Asset but that generally would not arise in connection with a consummated Asset-Backed Finance Asset (such as reverse break-up fees). 
 28 

The Operating Manager and its affiliates are entitled to reimbursement from each Series, in its proportionate share, for any Operating Expenses or Organizational and Offering Expenses paid or incurred by them on behalf of, or in relation to, such Series. 
 If any Operating Expenses are incurred for the account or for the benefit of each Series and one or more other Apollo Clients, the Operating Manager will allocate such Operating Expenses among such Series and each such other Apollo Client in proportion to the size of the investment made by each in the activity or entity to which such Operating Expenses relate, to the extent applicable, or in such other manner as the Operating Manager in good faith determines is fair and reasonable. 
 Series I, Series II and the Company incurred Operating Expenses of 198, 1,191 and 1,389, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These expenses relate to general and administration expenses and director fees. 
 Company Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement of the Operating Manager 
 The Operating Manager may elect to pay certain of our expenses, including certain Organizational and Offering Expenses on our behalf (each, an Expense Support ). 
 Following any calendar month in which the Specified Expenses are below 0.75 of the Company s net assets on an annualized basis, the Company shall reimburse the Operating Manager, fully or partially, for the Expense Supports, but only if and to the extent that Specified Expenses plus any Reimbursement Payments (as defined below) do not exceed 0.75 of the Company s net assets at the end of each calendar month on an annualized basis, until such time as all Expense Supports made by the Operating Manager to the Company within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Company in the prior sentence shall be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment . 
 Specified Expenses is defined to include all expenses incurred in the business of the Company with the exception of (i) the Management Fee, (ii) the Performance Fee, (iii) the combined annual distribution fees and shareholder servicing fees, (iv) the dealer manager fees (including selling commissions), (v) expenses related to any Asset-Backed Finance Asset, (vi) interest expenses, commitment fees, or other expenses related to any leverage incurred by the Company, (vii) taxes, (viii) certain insurance costs, (ix) Organizational and Offering Expenses, (x) certain non-routine items (as determined in the sole discretion of the Operating Manager) and (xi) extraordinary expenses (as determined in the sole discretion of the Operating Manager). 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Operating Manager elected to provide Expense Support of (205), (1,238) and (1,443) for expenses incurred by Series I, Series II and the Company, respectively. 
 Hedging 
 The Company and/or its operating subsidiaries expect to employ hedging in support of financing techniques or that is designed to reduce the risks of adverse movements in interest rates, securities prices, commodities prices and currency exchange rates, as well as other risks. While such transactions may reduce certain risks, such transactions themselves may entail certain other risks, including counterparty default, convergence and other related risks. Thus, while the Company and/or its operating subsidiaries may benefit from the use of these hedging mechanisms, unanticipated changes in interest rates, securities prices, commodities prices or currency exchange rates or other events related to hedging activities could result in a poorer overall performance for the Company and/or its operating subsidiaries than if it or its operating subsidiaries had not entered into such hedging transactions. 
 The Company uses SOFR Futures to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the Company s fixed rate debt. See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies , Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Derivative Instruments and our consolidated condensed schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for derivative instruments. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 A subsidiary of Apollo has made initial capital contributions of 1,000 in cash, in exchange for 40 Series I V Shares and 1,000 in cash, in exchange for 40 Series II V Shares. On May 3, 2024, a subsidiary of Apollo, for 50,000,000 in cash, purchased 2,000,000 E Shares in Series II. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued shares for an aggregate consideration of 14,586, 26,156, and 40,742 for Series I, Series II, and the Company, respectively. The Company may issue additional Series I and Series II V Shares to Apollo in exchange for one or more capital contributions to facilitate the acquisition of the Company s initial assets. Apollo currently holds all of the Company s outstanding Series I and Series II V Shares. The V Shares may be transferred to an Apollo affiliate or Apollo Client. If an Apollo affiliate or Apollo Client become the holder of a majority of the V Shares, that entity would have majority control over the Company, including the right to vote for the appointment of the Company s directors. While the LLC Agreement permits transfer of the V Shares to a third party, the Company does not currently anticipate that 
 29 

any such transfer would take place. In the event of such a transfer in the future however, if Apollo or its affiliates cease to own a majority of V Shares, any expected benefits derived by the Company and Shareholders from such involvement by Apollo, including access to personnel and other resources, could be lost or otherwise affected. 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of our continuous private offering, (ii) cash flows from our operations, (iii) any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future and (iv) any future offerings of our equity or debt securities. We believe that cash provided by such means will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and foreseeable future. 
 Our primary use of cash is for (i) acquisition of asset-backed finance assets, (ii) the cost of operations (including the Management Fee and Performance Fee), (iii) debt service of any borrowings, (iv) periodic repurchases, including under the Repurchase Plan (as described herein) and (v) cash distributions (if any) to the holders of our Shares to the extent declared by the Board. 
 The minimum initial purchase amount is 2,500 for S Shares, I Shares, P-S Shares, P-I Shares, F-S Shares, F-I Shares, A-I Shares and A-II Shares. The minimum subsequent purchase amount is 500 for each type of Shares, except for additional purchases pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan DRIP ), which are not subject to a minimum purchase amount. The minimum purchase amount for each type of Shares can be modified or waived in the sole discretion of the Company or the Dealer Manager, including for certain financial firms that submit orders on behalf of their customers, our officers and directors and certain employees of Apollo, including its affiliates, and vehicles controlled by such employees and their extended family members. The Company and the Dealer Manager each reserves the right to designate and re-designate the Founder Intermediary or Anchor Intermediary status of financial intermediaries in its sole discretion. 
 Share Repurchases 
 We expect that each Series will conduct quarterly Share repurchases (each, a Share Repurchase for up to 5.0 of the aggregate NAV of our outstanding Investor Shares and E Shares of each Series (measured collectively across both Series) at a price based on the NAV per Share as of the last business day of the quarter prior to the commencement of a Share Repurchase (the Repurchase Plan ). The Company expects to make the Share Repurchases beginning with the second full quarter after the initial raising of third-party capital. Due to tax considerations and other factors, the NAV between each Series will differ and, because of differential fees and other factors, the NAV between Share types will differ, but all NAV calculations are expected to be based on the joint underlying economic interests tof both Series in the assets underlying its Asset-Backed Finance Assets. 
 Distributions 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had not declared or paid any distributions.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management believes are critical. We consider these policies critical because they involve significant judgments and assumptions and require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Our accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to use judgments in the application of such policies. These judgments will affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. 
 Investments, At Fair Value ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value. The Company recognizes and accounts for its investments at fair value. The fair value of the investments does not reflect transactions costs that may be incurred upon disposition of investments. 
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity for disclosure purposes. 
 Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined under GAAP, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities, are as follows: 
 Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
 Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. 
 Level 3 Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. 
 A significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. In those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and an adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value. 
 Valuation Guidelines 
 The Company s Asset-Backed Finance Assets are valued at fair value in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), including Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure ASC Topic 820 ), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 There is no single standard for determining fair values of assets that do not have a readily available market price and, in many cases, such fair values may be best expressed as a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each acquisition while employing a valuation process that is consistently followed. Determinations of fair value involve subjective judgments and estimates. 
 When making fair value determinations for Asset-Backed Finance Assets that do not have readily available market prices, we consider industry-accepted valuation methodologies, primarily consisting of an income approach and market approach. The income 
 31 

approach derives fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, or security is expected to generate in the future. The market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions or assets are comparable. A blend of approaches may be relied upon in arriving at an estimate of fair value, though there may be instances where it is more appropriate to utilize one approach. We also consider a range of additional factors that we deem relevant, including a potential sale of the Asset-Backed Finance Assets, macro and local market conditions, industry information and the relevant Asset-Backed Finance Asset s historical and projected financial data. 
 Asset-Backed Finance Assets are generally valued at the relevant transaction price initially; however, to the extent the Operating Manager does not believe an Asset-Backed Finance Asset s transaction price reflects the current market value, the Operating Manager will adjust such valuation. When making fair value determinations for Asset-Backed Finance Assets, the Operating Manager updates the prior month-end valuations by incorporating the then current market comparables and discount rate inputs, any material changes to the financial performance of the Asset-Backed Finance Assets since the prior valuation date, as well as any cash flow activity related to the Asset-Backed Finance Assets during the month. The Operating Manager values Asset-Backed Finance Assets using the valuation methodology it deems most appropriate and consistent with widely recognized valuation methodologies and market conditions. 
 When making fair value determinations for assets that do not have a reliable, readily available market price, which the Company expects to be the case for a significant number of its Asset-Backed Finance Assets, the Operating Manager may engage one or more independent valuation firms to provide positive assurance regarding the reasonableness of such valuations as of the relevant measurement date. 
 Because assets are valued as of a specified valuation date, events occurring subsequent to that date will not be reflected in the Company s valuations. However, if information indicating a condition that existed at the valuation date becomes available subsequent to the valuation date and before financial information is publicly released, it will be evaluated to determine whether it would have a material impact requiring adjustment of the final valuation. 
 At least annually, the Board, including our independent directors, will review the appropriateness of Apollo s valuation guidelines as adopted by the Board. From time to time, the Board, including our independent directors, may adopt changes to the valuation guidelines applicable to us on occasions in which it has determined or in the future determines that such changes are likely to result in a more accurate reflection of estimated fair value. 
 See Notes 2 and 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding the fair value of our investments. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures about Market Risk 

Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk with respect to our Asset-Backed Finance Assets. Subject to oversight by the Board, the Operating Manager is responsible for the oversight of risks to our business. 
 Changes in Market Interest Rates 
 With respect to our business operations, general decreases in interest rates over time may cause the interest income associated with our Asset-Backed Finance Assets to decrease. Conversely, general increases in interest rates over time may cause the interest income associated with our Asset-Backed Finance Assets to increase. General increases or decreases in interest rates over time may have an impact on the value of our Asset-Backed Finance Assets. 
 The Company s Asset-Backed Finance Assets were comprised of 57 fixed rate investments and 43 floating rate investments, with fair values of 43,751 and 33,077, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. An increase or decrease of 1 in market interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of annual interest income of approximately 331 with respect to the floating rate investments. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the applicable agreement. If the fair value of an agreement is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of an agreement is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We will seek to minimize the credit risk in our agreements by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. 
 32 

Market Risk 
 Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The market risk associated with contracts bearing interest rates is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. With regard to floating rate assets, we will assess our interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. We will maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both our then-existing and expected Asset-Backed Finance Assets as well as our potential offsetting hedge positions. While this hedging strategy will be designed to minimize the impact on our net income and funds from operations from changes in interest rates, the overall returns on your investment may be reduced. 
 Item 4. Controls an d Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company and the Series maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon this evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal period, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Certifications

E. No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements . Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other compensation arrangements, which may, but need not, provide for the issuance of Awards, securities and other types of awards, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

G. Other Laws . The Board may refuse to issue or transfer any Award if, acting in good faith, it determines that the issuance or transfer of such Award would violate the LLC Agreement or any applicable law or regulation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no issuance of an Award hereunder shall be construed as an offer to sell securities of the Company, and no such offer shall be outstanding, unless and until the Company in its sole discretion has determined that any such offer, if made, would be in compliance with all applicable securities laws. 

H. No Trust or Fund Created . Neither the Plan nor any award made under the Plan shall create or be construed to create a trust or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person.

J. Severability . If any provision of the Plan or any award made hereunder is, becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Board, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Board, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. 

K. Headings . Headings are used herein solely as a convenience to facilitate reference and shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof. 

L. Interpretation . The terms defined in the singular shall have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice versa. Any reference hereunder to a sole discretion scope of the Board s authority shall mean that such discretion shall be exercised in good faith. 

M. Gender . Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein shall also include the feminine. 

N. Amendment to LLC Agreement . Neither the adoption of the Plan nor any Award made hereunder shall restrict in any way the adoption of any amendment to, or any restatement of, the LLC Agreement in accordance with the terms of such agreements.

7 

 O. Conflict Between the Plan and the LLC Agreement . The Plan is subject to the LLC Agreement, the terms and provisions of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between any term or provision contained herein or therein, the LLC Agreement shall govern and prevail. In the event of a conflict between any term or provision contained in an Award Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall govern and prevail. 

P. Notices . Any notice necessary under the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be addressed to the Company at the principal executive office of the Company and to the Participant at the address appearing in the personnel records of the Company (or one of the Company s Affiliates) for the Participant or to either party at such other address as either party hereto may hereafter designate in writing to the other.
