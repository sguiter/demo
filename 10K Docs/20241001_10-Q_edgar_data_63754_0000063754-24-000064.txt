 In 2022, our Management Committee approved the GOE program, which is expected to eliminate costs associated with our supply chain operations, as well as across the remainder of the organization. The GOE program included a voluntary retirement plan, which included enhanced separation benefits to certain U.S. employees aged 55 years or older with at least ten years of service to the company. This voluntary retirement plan commenced in November 2022, and participants were required to submit their notifications by December 30, 2022. The GOE program also includes other employee separation actions as other related costs within the program. The total costs incurred under the GOE program were approximately million as of November 30, 2023. Special charges recognized during the three months ended August 31, 2024, under our GOE program included million in severance and related benefits costs. Special charges recognized during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, under our GOE program included million in severance and related benefits costs and million of third-party expenses and other costs.

 In 2022, our Management Committee approved an initiative to consolidate our manufacturing operations in the United Kingdom into a net-zero carbon condiments manufacturing and distribution center facility with state-of-the-art technology. We expect to execute these changes to our supply chain operations and improve profitability, from a combination of lower headcount and non-headcount costs, by consolidating our operations into a scalable platform while expanding our capacity. We expect the cost of the initiative to approximate million to be recognized as special charges in our consolidated income statement through 2024. Of that million, we expect the costs to include employee severance and related benefits, non-cash accelerated depreciation, equipment relocation costs, decommissioning and other property related lease exit costs, all directly related to the initiative. The total costs incurred under this program were approximately million as of November 30, 2023. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we recognized a reversal of million associated with severance and related benefits costs and million in third-party expenses and other costs. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we recognized a reversal of million associated with severance and related benefits costs and million in third-party expenses and other costs. During the three months ended August 31, 2023, we recognized million in accelerated depreciation and million in third-party expenses and other costs. During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, we recognized million in accelerated depreciation and million in third-party expenses and other costs. 
 As of August 31, 2024, accruals associated with special charges of million are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.

 million revolving credit facility which will expire in August 2025 (the facility). The current pricing for the facility, on a fully drawn basis, is SOFR + . The pricing of the facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the facility equal to SOFR + . The provisions of this revolving credit facility restrict subsidiary indebtedness and require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, consistent with our billion revolving credit facility (the facility). We do not expect that this covenant would limit our access to the facility or the facility for the foreseeable future. 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we repaid our million notes due in August 2024. 
 We use derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including foreign currency, net investment and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument, and all derivatives are designated as hedges. We are not a party to master netting arrangements, and we do not offset the fair value of derivative contracts with the same counterparty in our financial statement disclosures. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the use of written guidelines. 
 Foreign currency exchange risk. We are potentially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments in subsidiaries, transactions (both third-party and intercompany) and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. We assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contract and currency swaps with highly-rated financial institutions to reduce fluctuations in the long or short currency positions.

 Cash flow hedge Total 
 All of these contracts were designated as hedges of foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities or hedges of anticipated purchases denominated in a foreign currency. Hedge ineffectiveness was not material. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at August 31, 2024 have durations of less than 15 months, including million of notional contracts that have an initial duration of less than one month and are used to hedge short-term cash flow funding. 
 Contracts which are designated as hedges of foreign currency denominated assets are considered fair value hedges. These foreign currency exchange contracts manage both exposure to currency fluctuations in certain intercompany loans between subsidiaries as well as currency exposure to third-party non-functional currency assets or liabilities. Gains and losses from contracts that are designated as hedges of assets, liabilities or firm commitments are recognized through income, offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item. Contracts which are designated as hedges of anticipated purchases denominated in a foreign currency (generally purchases of inventory in U.S. dollars by operating units outside the U.S.) are considered cash flow hedges. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in cost of goods sold, at which time the net amount deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income is also recognized in cost of goods sold. 
 We also utilize cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are designated as net investment hedges. Gains or losses on net investment hedges, exclusive of interest accruals, are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We exclude the interest accruals on cross-currency interest rate swap contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness. We recognize the interest accruals on cross-currency interest rate swap contracts within interest expense. 
 Interest rate risk. We finance a portion of our operations with both fixed and variable rate debt instruments, principally commercial paper, notes and bank loans. We utilize interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swap agreements, to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of variable and fixed rate debt.

 For all net investment hedges, no amounts have been reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amounts noted in the tables above for OCI do not include any adjustments for the impact of deferred income taxes. 
 We maintain a nonrecourse accounts receivable sale program whereby certain eligible U.S. receivables are sold to a third-party financial institution in exchange for cash. The program provides us with an additional means for managing liquidity. Under the terms of the arrangement, we act as the collecting agent on behalf of the financial institution. We account for the transfer of receivables as a sale at the point control is transferred through derecognition of the receivable on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The outstanding amounts of receivables sold under this program were million and million as of August 31, 2024, and November 30, 2023, respectively. As collecting agent on the sold receivables, we had million and million of cash collected that was not yet remitted to the third-party financial institution as of August 31, 2024, and November 30, 2023, respectively. The incremental costs of selling receivables under this arrangement were insignificant for the three months and nine months ended August 31, 2024.

 At August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the carrying amounts of interest rate derivatives, foreign currency derivatives, cross currency contracts, insurance contracts, and bond and other long-term investments were equal to their respective fair values. Because of their short-term nature, the amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, short-term borrowings and trade accounts payable approximate fair value. Investments in affiliates are not readily marketable, and it is not practicable to estimate their fair value. 
 Insurance contracts, bonds, and other long-term investments are comprised of fixed income and equity securities held for certain non-qualified U.S. employee benefit plans and are stated at fair value on the balance sheet. The fair values of insurance contracts are based upon the underlying values of the securities in which they are invested and are from quoted market prices from various stock and bond exchanges for similar type assets. The fair values of bonds and other long-term investments are based on quoted market prices from various stock and bond exchanges. The fair values for interest rate derivatives, foreign currency derivatives, and cross currency contracts are based on values for similar instruments using models with market-based inputs.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 OVERVIEW 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to help the reader understand McCormick Company, Incorporated, our operations, and our present business environment from the perspective of management. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, included in Item 1 of this report. We use certain non-GAAP information more fully described below under the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. Unless otherwise noted, the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in MD A are in millions, except per share data.

Business profile 
 McCormick is a global leader in flavor. We manufacture, market and distribute spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry retailers, food manufacturers and the foodservice business. In fiscal year 2023, approximately 39 of our sales were outside of the U.S. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. We manage our business in two business segments, consumer and flavor solutions. 
 Executive Summary 
 In the third quarter of 2024, our sales declined by 0.3 from the third quarter 2023 level, including impact from the following factors: 
 Volume and product mix favorably impacted our net sales by 0.6 , exclusive of divestitures. The consumer segment experienced favorable volume and product mix of 1.0 and the flavor solutions segment experienced flat volume and product mix. 
 Pricing impacts unfavorably impacted our net sales decline by 0.2 . The unfavorable impact of pricing actions in our consumer segment more than offset the favorable impact of pricing actions in our flavor solutions segment. 
 Divestitures negatively impacted our net sales by 0.3 . 
 Net sales were negatively impacted by fluctuations in currency rates by 0.4 , decreasing sales growth by 0.2 in our consumers segment and 0.5 in our flavor solutions segment. 
 Operating income was 286.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 245.0 million in the comparable 2023 period, an increase of 16.9 . We recorded 1.9 million and 6.1 million of special charges in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to organization and streamlining actions. In the third quarter of 2024, our gross profit margin improved by 170 basis points, primarily driven by favorable product and customer mix and cost savings led by our comprehensive continuous improvement (CCI) program. Also, in the third quarter of 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points, which was driven by lower incentive and stock-based compensation expenses as well as CCI-led cost savings. Excluding special charges, adjusted operating income was 288.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 14.9 , compared to 251.1 million in the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income increased 15.6 . 
 Diluted earnings per share was 0.83 and 0.63 in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by the impact of higher operating income, including the effects of lower special charges, the favorable effects of a decrease in the effective tax rate, including the effects of favorable discrete income tax benefits, and the favorable effects of an increase in income from unconsolidated operations. Special charges lowered earnings per share by 0.02 in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the effects of special charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0.83 in the third quarter of 2024 and 0.65 in the third quarter of 2023, or an increase of 27.7 . 
 A detailed review of our third quarter 2024 performance compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and our performance for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period appears in the section titled Results of Operations Company and Results of Operations Segments . For a reconciliation of non-GAAP to reported amounts, see the subsequent discussion under the heading "Non-GAAP Financial Measures". 
 2024 Outlook 
 In 2024, we expect net sales to range from a decline of 1 to an increase of 1 on both a reported and a constant currency basis, with a minimal impact from currency. We anticipate that the 2024 sales change will include a favorable impact from prior year pricing actions, which will be partially reduced by current year pricing actions taken in response to price gap management as well as promotional activities. We anticipate that our volume and product mix will be impacted by the divestiture of our Giotti canning business in the third quarter of last year, and the pruning of low margin businesses. 
 We expect our 2024 gross profit margin to range from 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher than our gross profit margin of 37.6 in 2023. The projected 2024 increase in gross profit margin is principally due to the net effect of (i) the favorable impact of pricing actions, (ii) the favorable impacts of product mix, (iii) the favorable impact of anticipated GOE program and CCI cost savings, and (iv) a low single-digit percentage impact of inflation in 2024 compared to 2023.

Table of Contents 

 In 2024, we expect an increase in operating income of 9 to 11 , which includes a minimal impact from foreign currency rates, over the 2023 level. The projected 2024 change in operating income includes the effects of the anticipated increase in our gross profit margin as well as SG A cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, which will be partially offset by our investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing investments in 2024 to increase in the high-single digits over the 2023 level. We also expect approximately 15 million of special charges in 2024 that relate to previously announced organization and streamlining actions; in 2023, special charges were 61.2 million. Excluding special charges, we expect 2024 s adjusted operating income to increase by 4 to 6 on a reported and a constant currency basis, with a minimal impact from currency. 
 We estimate that our 2024 effective tax rate, including the net favorable impact of anticipated discrete tax items, will be 21 as compared to 21.8 in 2023. Excluding projected taxes associated with special charges, we estimate that our adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 21 in 2024, as compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.0 in 2023. 
 We also expect that our income from unconsolidated operations, including the performance of our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, will increase by a mid-teens percentage rate over the 2023 level. 
 Diluted earnings per share was 2.52 in 2023. Diluted earnings per share for 2024 is projected to range from 2.81 to 2.86. Excluding the per share impact of special charges of 61.2 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share was 2.70 in 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding an estimated per share impact from special charges of 0.04, is projected to range from 2.85 to 2.90 in 2024, or an increase of 5 to 7 over adjusted diluted earnings per share of 2.70 in 2023.

 Sales for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 0.3 from the prior year level and increased by 0.1 on a constant currency basis (that is, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption, Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Pricing actions decreased sales by 0.2 as compared to the prior period. Pricing actions taken in response to price gap management as well as promotional activities in our consumer segment were mitigated by the favorable impact of pricing actions taken in the prior year. F avorable volume and product mix increased sales by 0.6 for the quarter. Favorable volume and product mix in our consumer segment was mitigated by flat volume and product mix in our flavor solutions segment. Also, the divestiture of our Giotti canning business unfavorably impacted sales by 0.3 as compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency rates decreased sales by 0.4 for the quarter and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 0.1 on a constant currency basis. 
 Sales for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 increased by 0.3 from the prior year level and increased by 0.1 on a constant currency basis. Pricing actions increased sales by 0.8 as compared to the prior year period principally due to pricing actions implemented in the prior year. Unfavorable volume and product mix from both our consumer and flavor solutions segments collectively decreased sales by 0.4 . Our decisions to discontinue certain low margin businesses contributed approximately 0.3 to the unfavorable impact of volume and product mix. Also, the divestiture of our Giotti canning business unfavorably impacted sales by 0.3 as compared to the prior year period. Sales were also impacted by favorable foreign currency rates that increased net sales by 0.2 in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the prior period and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 0.1 on a constant currency basis. 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 27.1 million, or 4.4 , from the comparable period in 2023. Our gross profit margin for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 38.7 , an increase of 170 basis points from the comparable

 period in 2023. The increase in gross profit margin in the quarter ended August 31, 2024 was driven by favorable product and customer mix and cost savings led by our CCI program as compared to the 2023 period. 
 Gross profit for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 increased by 67.6 million, or 3.8 , from the comparable period in 2023. Our gross profit margin for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 37.9 , an increase of 120 basis points from the comparable period in 2023. The increase in gross profit margin in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was driven by the favorable impact of our pricing actions, favorable product and customer mix, less scrapped inventory, and cost savings led by our CCI and GOE programs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by increased commodity and conversion costs as compared to the 2023 period.

 SG A decreased by 10.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the 2023 level, driven primarily by lower performance-based employee and stock-based compensation expense as well as CCI-led cost savings. SG A as a percentage of net sales decreased b y 60 basis points from the prior year levels due to the factors described above. 
 SG A increased by 18.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to the 2023 period, driven primarily by advertising and promotional spend, increased selling and marketing costs and a higher investment in research and development. These costs were partially offset by lower performance-based employee and stock-based compensation expense as well as CCI-led and GOE cost savings, all as compared to the 2023 period. SG A as a percentage of net sales increased by 30 basis points from the prior year levels due primarily to a 40 basis point increase in advertising and promotional expenses as compared to the prior year period.

Table of Contents 

 Interest expense increased 0.8 million and 1.2 million in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, driven by the effects of a reduction in average borrowing levels which were more than offset by higher average interest rates on borrowings. Other income, net for the three months ended August 31, 2024 increased as compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in interest income and a lower level of foreign currency exchanges losses. Other income, net for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 increased as compared to the prior period primarily due to an increase in interest income.

Higher sales in the EMEA region were offset by decreases in the Americas and APAC regions, all as compared to the prior year quarter. Pricing, including actions taken in response to price gap management as well as promotional activities, unfavorably impacted sales by 0.8 as compared to the prior year period. Favorable volume and product mix increased consumer segment sales by 1.0 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period last year. Sales in the third quarter of 2024 reflected an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that decreased consumer segment sales by 0.2 compared to the year-ago quarter and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 0.2 on a constant currency basis.

 Segment operating income for our consumer segment increased by 13.5 million, or 7.8 , in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023. The increase in segment operating income was driven by the effects of a decrease in SG A expenses, primarily driven by lower distribution, incentive, and stock compensation expense as well as CCI-led cost savings, which more than offset a decrease in gross profit. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to unfavorable pricing, which more than offset the favorable impacts of product mix, and CCI-led cost savings, all as compared to the prior year period.

 In the EMEA region, flavor solutions sales decreased by 8.4 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and declined by 9.0 on a constant currency basis. Pricing actions, principally due to those implemented in the prior year, unfavorably impacted sales by 1.4 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior period level. Unfavorable volume and product mix decreased segment sales in the EMEA region by 4.5 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 including the effects of lower sales at quick service restaurants, and a 1.1 impact of our decision to discontinue a low margin business. The divestiture of our Giotti canning business unfavorably impacted sales by 3.1 as compared to the prior year period. A favorable impact from foreign currency rates increased sales by 0.6 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 9.0 on a constant currency basis. 
 In the APAC region, flavor solutions sales decreased 1.3 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and decreased by 0.1 on a constant currency basis. Pricing actions, principally due to those implemented in the prior year, favorably impacted sales by 0.3 as compared to the prior year period. Unfavorable volume and product mix decreased segment sales by 0.4 in the third quarter of 2024. Growth in quick service restaurant sales in China were more than offset by softness in quick service restaurant sales in other parts of the region. An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 1.2 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 0.1 on a constant currency basis. 
 For the nine months ended August 31, 2024, our flavor solutions sales increased 0.5 as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023 and increased by 0.2 on a constant currency basis. Pricing actions, principally due to those implemented in the prior year, across all regions increased sales by 1.2 during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and were partially offset by 0.4 of unfavorable volume and product mix, both as compared to the prior year period. Volume and product mix includes a 0.3 unfavorable impact from the prior year associated with our decision to discontinue certain low margin businesses. The divestiture of our Giotti canning business unfavorably impacted sales by 0.6 as compared to the prior year period. The favorable impact of foreign currency rates increased flavor solutions segment sales by 0.3 compared to the year-ago period and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 0.2 on a constant currency basis. 
 Segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment increased by 23.8 million, or 30.6 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in segment operating income was driven by the effects of an increase in gross profit primarily due to product mix and pricing actions, and CCI-led cost savings. Segment operating margin for our flavor solutions segment increased by 330 basis points from the prior year level to 13.7 in the third quarter of 2024. That

 increase was the result of an increase in gross margin, as previously described, which was partially offset by a higher level of SG A as a percentage of sales, all as compared to 2023. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment increased by 32.0 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment increased by 37.0 million, or 17.4 , in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in segment operating income was driven by the effects of an increase in gross profit primarily due to favorable impacts of pricing actions, product mix, and CCI-led and GOE cost savings which more than offset the higher level of SG A expenses. Segment operating margin for our flavor solutions segment increased by 160 basis points from the prior year level to 11.5 in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. That increase was the result of an increase in gross margin, as previously described, which was partially offset by a higher level of SG A as a percentage of sales, all as compared to 2023. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment increased by 17.4 in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY 
 We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency risk affecting net investments in subsidiaries, transactions (both third-party and intercompany) and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Management assesses foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contract and currency swaps with highly-rated financial institutions to reduce fluctuations in the long or short currency positions. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. All derivatives are designated as hedges. 
 The following table sets forth the notional values and unrealized net gain (loss) of the portfolio of our forward foreign currency and cross currency swap contracts: 
 August 31, 2024 November 30, 2023 Forward foreign currency: Notional value 1,110.7 1,000.4 Unrealized net (loss) (14.3) (13.5) Cross currency swaps: Notional value 983.8 958.5 Unrealized net gain 12.7 17.1 
 The outstanding notional value is a result of our decisions on foreign currency exposure coverage, based on our foreign currency and foreign currency translation exposures. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We manage our interest rate exposure by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments, and all derivatives are designated as hedges. 
 The following table sets forth the notional values and unrealized net gain (loss) of our interest rate swap contracts: August 31, 2024 November 30, 2023 Notional value 600.0 600.0 Unrealized net (loss) (36.0) (52.8) 
 The change in fair values of our interest rate swap contracts is due to changes in interest rates on the notional amounts outstanding as of each date as well as the remaining duration of our interest rate derivative contracts.

 Commodity Risk 
 We purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions, growing and harvesting conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. Our most significant raw materials are dairy products, pepper, onion, garlic, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), tomato products, salts, and wheat products. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. 
 Credit Risk 
 The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers, dollar stores, warehouse clubs, discount chains and e-commerce. This has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. We continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value. We consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 The following table includes financial measures of adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These represent non-GAAP financial measures, which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These financial measures exclude the impact of special charges and the associated income tax effects, as applicable. 
 Special charges consist of expenses and income, as applicable, associated with certain actions undertaken by us to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee. Expenses associated with the approved actions are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion. 
 Details with respect to the composition of special charges set forth below are included in note 2 of the notes to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Details with respect to the composition of special charges for the year ended November 30, 2023 are included in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023. 
 We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important. The exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting.

(2) Income tax rate is calculated as income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes. Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes excluding special charges of 248.1 million and 205.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, and 2023 respectively, and 642.0 million and 588.1 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes excluding special charges of 859.9 million for the year ended November 30, 2023. 
 Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed on a constant currency basis , is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).

 Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the comparative year.

 To present constant currency information for the fiscal year 2024 projection, projected sales and adjusted operating income for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the company s budgeted exchange rates for 2024 and are compared to the 2023 results, translated into U.S. dollars using the same 2024 budgeted exchange rates, rather than at the average actual exchange rates in effect during fiscal year 2023. 

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Nine months ended August 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 463.2 660.1 Net cash used in investing activities (189.1) (184.8) Net cash used in financing activities (205.9) (701.2) 
 The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us with flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. We use a combination of equity and short- and long-term debt. We use short-term debt, comprised primarily of commercial paper, principally to finance ongoing operations, including our requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities). We are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings. 
 Our cash flows from operations enable us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives, service our debt, fund or increase our quarterly dividends, fund capital projects and other investments, and make share repurchases when appropriate. Due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business, our cash flow from operations has historically been the strongest during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Due to the timing of the interest payments on our long-term debt, interest payments are higher in the first and third quarters of our fiscal year. 
 We believe that our sources of liquidity, which include existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, our commercial paper program, and access to capital markets, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months. 
 In the condensed consolidated cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the translation effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows. Accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet. 
 Operating Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities of 463.2 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, decreased 196.9 million from the same period of 2023. The effects of the increase in earnings were more than offset by higher cash used for working capital, certain employee incentive compensation arrangements accrued as of the prior year-end and paid in the subsequent fiscal year as well as the timing of income tax payments. 
 Investing Cash Flow Cash used in investing activities of 189.1 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 increased by 4.3 million as compared to 184.8 million for the corresponding period in 2023. Capital expenditures increased from the 2023 level of 187.2 million to 189.3 million, and the cash generated by other investing activities declined from 2.4 million in 2023 to 0.2 million in 2024. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to approximate 290 million. 
 Financing Cash Flow Financing activities used cash of 205.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 and decreased 495.3 million as compared to 701.2 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease is a result of changes in our net borrowings.

 The following table outlines our net borrowing activities: Nine months ended August 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 Net increase (decrease) in short-term borrowings 908.6 (850.0) Proceeds of issuance of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs 495.3 Repayments of long-term debt (752.8) (12.7) Net cash provided by (used in) borrowing activities 155.8 (367.4) 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we repaid our 700.0 million 3.15 notes due in August 2024. During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, we issued 500.0 million of 4.95 notes due in 2033, with net cash proceeds received of 496.4 million. 
 The following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase program for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023: 2024 2023 Number of shares of common stock repurchased (in thousands) 382 318 Dollar amount (in millions) 29.0 26.7 
 As of August 31, 2024, 472 million remained of the 600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by the Board of Directors in November 2019. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we received proceeds of 12.8 million from exercised stock options as compared to 15.9 million received in the corresponding 2023 period. We repurchased 8.9 million and 10.8 million of common stock during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in conjunction with employee tax withholding requirements associated with our stock compensation plans. 
 We increased dividends paid to 338.3 million, or a per share quarterly dividend of 0.42, in the first nine months of 2024 from 313.8 million, or a per share quarterly dividend of 0.39, of dividends paid in the same period last year. The timing and amount of any future dividends is determined by our Board of Directors. 
 Most of our cash is in our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. Those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations, capital projects and any possible future acquisitions. 
 At August 31, 2024 and 2023, we temporarily used 609.0 million and 449.5 million, respectively, of cash from our non-U.S. subsidiaries to pay down short-term debt in the U.S. During a quarter, our short-term borrowings vary, but are typically lower at the end of a quarter. The average short-term borrowings outstanding for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 were 955.8 million and 1,163.1 million, respectively. Total average debt outstanding for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 was 4,970.8 million and 5,245.9 million, respectively. 
 The reported values of our assets and liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods. At August 31, 2024, the exchange rates for the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Polish zloty, and Australian dollar were higher than the U.S. dollar at November 30, 2023. At August 31, 2024, the exchange rate for the Mexican peso was lower than the U.S. dollar at November 30, 2023. 
 Credit and Capital Markets 
 Cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth, dividends, capital expenditures and share repurchases. We also rely on our revolving credit facilities, or borrowings backed by these facilities, to fund working capital needs and other general corporate requirements. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 In August 2024, we entered into a 364-day 500 million revolving credit facility which will expire in August 2025 (the 364-day facility). The current pricing for the 364-day facility, on a fully drawn basis, is SOFR + 1.23 . The pricing of the 364-day facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to SOFR + 1.60 . We also maintain a committed five-year 1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which will expire in June 2026 (the five-year facility). The current pricing for the five-year facility, on a fully drawn basis, is Term SOFR plus 1.25 . The pricing of the five-year facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to Term SOFR plus 1.75 . 
 The provisions of our 364-day facility and five-year facility restrict subsidiary indebtedness and require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. We do not expect that this covenant would limit our access to those facilities for the foreseeable future. 
 We generally use our revolving credit facilities to support our issuance of commercial paper. If the commercial paper market is not available or viable, we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility. This facility is made available by a syndicate of banks, with various commitments per bank. If any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of our working capital. We periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. In addition, we engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facility. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe our banks will perform on their commitments. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 We will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest, to service debt, and to fund acquisitions. As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. Our primary obligations include principal and interest payments on our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Our other cash requirements include raw material purchases, lease payments, income taxes, anticipated quarterly dividends, and pension and postretirement benefits, as well as other contractual obligations. 
 These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. To meet those cash requirements, we intend to use our existing cash, cash equivalents and internally generated funds, to borrow under our existing credit facilities or under other short-term borrowing facilities and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular debt maturity to our then-available sources of funds, to obtain additional short- and long-term financing. We believe that the cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our future cash requirements. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 New accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations. See note 1 of notes to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further details of these impacts. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
 In preparing the financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe, given current facts and circumstances, our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. In preparing the financial statements, we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets and prepaid allowances. Our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023. 
 There have been no changes in our critical accounting estimates and assumptions included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: The company s management, with the participation of the company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Controls: During our third quarter of 2024, we migrated certain financial processing systems as part of our enterprise resource planning (ERP) replacement program. This migration included financial processing systems related to management of customer and vendor master data, accounts receivable cash application, indirect procurement and certain processes in accounts payable, and fixed assets, as well as our general ledger for our U.S. operations. We expect future migration of additional financial processing systems throughout our U.S. business as we complete the U.S. portion of the ERP replacement program through 2027. Except for the migration of certain financial processing systems, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13-a-15(f) that occurred during our latest fiscal quarter, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The prices paid per share represented the average of the high and low prices of the common shares on August 1, 2024 and August 2, 2024, respectively. Additionally, on August 28, 2024, we purchased 27,022 shares of our CS from our U.S. defined contribution retirement plan to manage shares, based upon participant activity, in the plan's company stock fund. The price paid per share represented the closing price of the CS on August 28, 2024. 
 As of August 31, 2024, 472 million remained of the 600 million share repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in November 2019. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. 
 In certain circumstances, we issue shares of CS in exchange for shares of CSNV, or issue shares of CSNV in exchange for shares of CS, in either case pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Typically, these exchanges are made in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans, executive compensation programs and dividend reinvestment/direct purchase plans or at the request of holders of common stock. The number of shares issued in an exchange is generally equal to the number of shares received in the exchange, although the number may differ slightly to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. During the third quarter of 2024, we issued 176,415 shares of CSNV in exchange for shares of CS and issued 90 shares of CS in exchange for shares of CSNV.
