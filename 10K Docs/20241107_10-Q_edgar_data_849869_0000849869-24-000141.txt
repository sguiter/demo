Fair Value Measurements 
 
 GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). GAAP classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into a hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level 1 inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs represent unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
 
 Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value 
 
 The financial assets and liabilities that were measured on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 consisted of our cash and cash equivalents and derivative instruments. We measured the fair value of cash and cash equivalents using Level 1 inputs. We measured the fair value of our derivative instruments using the income approach. The fair value of our derivative instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive based on the present value of the expected cash flows derived from market interest rates and prices. As such, these derivative instruments were classified within Level 2. 
 
 Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value 
 
 Our bank debt, 3 Senior Notes, 4 Senior Notes, 2 Senior Notes and Senior Secured Notes were recorded at historical amounts in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we have not elected to measure them at fair value. We measured the fair value of our variable rate bank debt using the market approach based on Level 2 inputs. Fair values of the 3 Senior Notes, 4 Senior Notes, 2 Senior Notes and Senior Secured Notes were estimated based on quoted market prices, a Level 1 input. 
 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 
 Our derivative financial instruments were recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Changes in fair values of derivatives are recorded in each period in earnings or comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.

 Net sales and adjusted EBIT of our metal containers segment and of part of our dispensing and specialty closures segment are dependent, in part, upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in a variety of national growing regions in Europe. The size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions. Because of the seasonality of the harvests, we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual adjusted EBIT during that quarter.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Statements included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements are made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of uncertainties and risks, including, but not limited to, those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, the actual results of our operations or our financial condition could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. 

General 
 
 We are a leading manufacturer and supplier of sustainable rigid packaging solutions for the world's essential consumer goods products. We currently produce dispensing and specialty closures for the fragrance and beauty, food, beverage, personal and health care, home care and lawn and garden markets; steel and aluminum containers for pet and human food and general line products; and custom designed plastic containers for the pet and human food, consumer health and pharmaceutical, personal care, home care, lawn and garden and automotive markets. We are a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing and specialty closures, a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, and a leading manufacturer of custom containers in North America for a variety of markets. 
 
 Our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business, reduce operating costs and build sustainable competitive positions, or franchises, and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns. We have grown our net sales and income from operations largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth, and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market. If acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time, we may use our cash flow to repay debt, repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted purposes.

 Summary unaudited results of operations for the periods presented are provided below. 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 Sept. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 (dollars in millions) Net sales Dispensing and Specialty Closures 563.7 559.1 1,665.0 1,699.1 Metal Containers 1,022.6 1,094.6 2,290.5 2,475.6 Custom Containers 158.8 149.4 488.0 473.4 Consolidated 1,745.1 1,803.1 4,443.5 4,648.1 Income before interest and income taxes Dispensing and Specialty Closures 74.7 78.0 213.3 212.6 Metal Containers 89.3 110.1 187.3 231.6 Custom Containers 17.1 10.7 55.5 46.1 Corporate (13.8) (4.7) (35.2) (21.0) Consolidated 167.3 194.1 420.9 469.3 

Net Sales . In the third quarter of 2024, consolidated net sales were 1.75 billion, a decrease of 58.0 million, or 3.2 percent, as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to the unfavorable impact from the pass through of lower raw material costs in the dispensing and specialty closures and metal containers segments, a less favorable mix of products sold in the metal containers segment and lower volumes in the dispensing and specialty closures segment. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes in the metal containers and custom containers segments, a more favorable mix of products sold in the dispensing and specialty closures segment and the pass through of higher raw material costs in the custom containers segment. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, consolidated net sales were 4.4 billion, a decrease of 204.6 million, or 4.4 percent, as compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the unfavorable impact from the pass through of lower raw material

costs in the dispensing and specialty closures and metal containers segments, lower volumes in the dispensing and specialty closures segment and a less favorable mix of products sold in the metal containers and custom containers segments. These decreases were partially offset by a more favorable mix of products sold in the dispensing and specialty closures segment, higher volumes and the pass through of higher raw material costs in the custom containers segment and the impact from favorable foreign currency translation. 
 
 Gross Profit . Gross profit margin increased 0.9 percentage points to 16.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 0.7 percentage points to 17.4 percent in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily for the reasons discussed below in "Income before Interest and Income Taxes." 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . In the third quarter of 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased to 6.1 percent as compared to 4.7 percent in the third quarter of 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22.1 million to 106.4 million as compared to the third quarter of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased to 7.1 percent as compared to 6.2 percent in the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 26.8 million to 314.6 million as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to 7.1 million and 12.6 million, respectively, of costs attributed to announced acquisitions and insurance proceeds received in the prior year periods. 
 
 Income before Interest and Income Taxes . In the third quarter of 2024, income before interest and income taxes decreased by 26.8 million to 167.3 million as compared to 194.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, and margins decreased to 9.6 percent from 10.7 percent over the same periods. The decrease in income before interest and income taxes was primarily the result of higher selling, general and administrative costs, higher rationalization charges, a less favorable mix of products sold in the metal containers segment, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and lower volumes in the dispensing and specialty closures segment, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity and cost performance in the dispensing and specialty closures segment, a more favorable mix of products sold in the dispensing and specialty closures and custom containers segments and higher volumes in the metal containers and custom containers segments. Rationalization charges were 19.5 million and 6.4 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, income before interest and income taxes decreased by 48.4 million to 420.9 million as compared to 469.3 million in the first nine months of 2023, and margins decreased to 9.5 percent from 10.1 percent over the same periods. The decrease in income before interest and income taxes was primarily the result of the unfavorable impact of lower fixed cost absorption in the metal containers segment as a result of a significantly lower inventory build in the current year period due to a reduction in pack plans of a large fruit and vegetable customer to reduce its working capital, higher rationalization charges, higher selling, general and administrative costs, the unfavorable impact in the metal containers segment of the sale of higher cost metal inventory from the prior year due to lower metal costs in 2024 in the European operations, a less favorable mix of products sold in the metal containers segment and lower volumes in the dispensing and specialty closures segment, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity and cost performance in the dispensing and specialty closures segment, a more favorable mix of products sold in the dispensing and specialty closures and custom containers segments and higher volumes in the custom containers segment. Rationalization charges were 38.0 million and 13.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Interest and Other Debt Expense . In the third quarter of 2024, interest and other debt expense decreased 5.4 million to 41.9 million as compared to 47.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, interest and other debt expense decreased 8.9 million to 121.9 million as compared to 130.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to lower average borrowings during the current year period, partially offset by the impact of higher weighted average interest rates. The decrease in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to lower average borrowings during the current year period and the write-off in the prior year period of 3.5 million of accrued interest income associated with a historical acquisition tax indemnity, partially offset by the impact of higher weighted average interest rates. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes . For the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rates were 20.2 percent and 24.7 percent, respectively. For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rates were 22.6 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was favorably impacted by the reversal of tax reserves due to the expiration of statutes of limitation. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was favorably impacted by the reversal of tax reserves associated with a historical acquisition indemnity which unfavorably impacted corporate and interest expense in such period.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are commonly referred to as GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as a financial measure that purports to measure financial performance, financial position or liquidity but excludes or includes amounts that could not be so adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin are unaudited supplemental measures of financial performance that the Company uses, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP and therefore are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to income before interest and income taxes or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any financial data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures because it considers them to be important and useful supplemental measures of its and its segments financial performance which provide a more complete understanding of the Company and its segments than could be obtained absent such non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that it is important and useful to present these non-GAAP financial measures because they allow for a better period-over-period comparison of results by removing the impact of items that, in management s view, do not reflect the Company s or its segments core operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to review and analyze the operating performance of the Company and its segments. Investors and others are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most comparable GAAP financial measure to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Adjusted EBIT, a non-GAAP financial measure, means income before interest and income taxes excluding, as applicable, acquired intangible asset amortization expense, other pension (income) expense for U.S. pension plans, rationalization charges and costs attributed to announced acquisitions. Adjusted EBIT margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, means adjusted EBIT divided by segment net sales. 
 
 Acquired intangible asset amortization expense is a non-cash expense related to acquired operations that management believes is not indicative of the on-going performance of the acquired operations. Since the Company s U.S. pension plans are significantly over funded and have no required cash contributions for the foreseeable future based on current regulations, management views other pension (income) expense from the Company s U.S. pension plans, which excludes service costs, as not reflective of the operational performance of the Company or its segments. While rationalization costs are incurred on a regular basis, management views these costs more as an investment to generate savings rather than period costs. Costs attributed to announced acquisitions consist of third party fees and expenses that are viewed by management as part of the acquisition and not indicative of the on-going cost structure of the Company.

Dispensing and Specialty Closures Segment 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 Sept. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Net sales 563.7 559.1 1,665.0 1,699.1 Income before interest and income taxes (EBIT) 74.7 78.0 213.3 212.6 Income before interest and income taxes margin (EBIT margin) 13.3 14.0 12.8 12.5 Adjusted EBIT 95.2 93.8 265.8 253.6 Adjusted EBIT margin 16.9 16.8 16.0 14.9 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, net sales for the dispensing and specialty closures segment increased 4.6 million, or 0.8 percent, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily the result of a more favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by lower unit volumes of approximately one percent, the pass through of lower raw material costs and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 2.0 million. Higher volumes for dispensing products were offset by lower volumes for beverage products. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, net sales for the dispensing and specialty closures segment decreased 34.1 million, or 2.0 percent, as compared to the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was primarily the result of lower unit volumes of approximately two percent, the pass through of lower raw material costs and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 1.0 million, partially offset by a more favorable mix of products sold. The decrease in unit volumes was principally the result of lower volumes for closures for food and beverage markets primarily due to customer destocking priorities. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, adjusted EBIT of the dispensing and specialty closures segment increased 1.4 million as compared to the third quarter of 2023, and adjusted EBIT margin increased to 16.9 percent from 16.8 percent over the same periods. The increase in adjusted EBIT was primarily due to improved manufacturing productivity and cost performance and a more favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and lower unit volumes. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, adjusted EBIT of the dispensing and specialty closures segment increased 12.2 million as compared to the first nine months of 2023, and adjusted EBIT margin increased to 16.0 percent from 14.9 percent over the same periods. The increase in adjusted EBIT was primarily due to improved manufacturing productivity and cost performance and a more favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by lower unit volumes.

Metal Containers Segment 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 Sept. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Net sales 1,022.6 1,094.6 2,290.5 2,475.6 Income before interest and income taxes (EBIT) 89.3 110.1 187.3 231.6 Income before interest and income taxes margin (EBIT margin) 8.7 10.1 8.2 9.4 Adjusted EBIT 97.1 113.5 200.5 241.7 Adjusted EBIT margin 9.5 10.4 8.8 9.8 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, net sales for the metal containers segment decreased 72.0 million, or 6.6 percent, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily the result of the contractual pass through of lower raw material costs as compared to the lagged contractual pass through of inflation in labor and other manufacturing costs in the prior year period and a significantly less favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by higher unit volumes of approximately two percent and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation of approximately 2.0 million. Higher volumes for the pet food markets were partially offset by lower volumes for fruit and vegetable markets which were negatively impacted by a planned reduction in volumes by a large pack customer to reduce its working capital and severe weather that prematurely ended the fruit and vegetable packs. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, net sales for the metal containers segment decreased 185.1 million, or 7.5 percent, as compared to the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was primarily the result of the contractual pass through of lower raw material costs as compared to the lagged contractual pass through of inflation in labor and other manufacturing costs in the prior year period and a less favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign currency translation of approximately 4.0 million. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, adjusted EBIT of the metal containers segment decreased 16.4 million as compared to the third quarter of 2023, and adjusted EBIT margin decreased to 9.5 percent from 10.4 percent for the same periods. The decrease in adjusted EBIT was primarily due to a significantly less favorable mix of products sold due to lower unit volumes for fruit and vegetable markets and higher selling, general and administrative costs, partially offset by higher unit volumes for pet food markets. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, adjusted EBIT of the metal containers segment decreased 41.2 million as compared to the first nine months of 2023, and adjusted EBIT margin decreased to 8.8 percent from 9.8 percent for the same periods. The decrease in adjusted EBIT was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of lower fixed cost absorption as a result of a significantly lower inventory build in the current year period due to a reduction in pack plans of a large fruit and vegetable customer to reduce its working capital, the unfavorable impact of selling higher cost inventory from the prior year in our European operations due to lower metal costs in 2024, a significantly less favorable mix of products sold and higher selling, general and administrative costs.

Custom Containers Segment 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 Sept. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Net sales 158.8 149.4 488.0 473.4 Income before interest and income taxes (EBIT) 17.1 10.7 55.5 46.1 Income before interest and income taxes margin (EBIT margin) 10.8 7.2 11.4 9.7 Adjusted EBIT 20.0 11.8 62.7 50.3 Adjusted EBIT margin 12.6 7.9 12.8 10.6 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, net sales for the custom containers segment increased 9.4 million, or 6.3 percent, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was principally due to higher volumes of approximately five percent primarily driven by the commercialization of new business awards and the pass through of higher raw material costs, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 1.0 million. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, net sales for the custom containers segment increased 14.6 million, or 3.1 percent, as compared to the first nine months of 2023. This increase was principally due to higher volumes of approximately three percent primarily as a result of the commercialization of new business awards and the pass through of higher raw material costs, partially offset by a less favorable mix of products sold and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 1.0 million. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, adjusted EBIT of the custom containers segment increased 8.2 million as compared to the third quarter of 2023, and adjusted EBIT margin increased to 12.6 percent from 7.9 percent over the same periods. The increase in adjusted EBIT was primarily attributable to a more favorable mix of products sold and higher volumes. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, adjusted EBIT of the custom containers segment increased 12.4 million as compared to the first nine months of 2023, and adjusted EBIT margin increased to 12.8 percent from 10.6 percent over the same periods. The increase in adjusted EBIT was primarily attributable to a more favorable mix of products sold and higher volumes. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments, including our senior secured credit facility. Our liquidity requirements arise from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness, capital investment in new and existing equipment, the funding of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate uses. 
 
 On October 15, 2024, we acquired Weener, a leading producer of differentiated dispensing solutions for personal care, food and healthcare products. Weener operates a global network of 19 facilities predominantly in Europe and the Americas, with approximately 4,000 employees and proprietary manufacturing technologies including significant clean room capabilities. The purchase price for this acquisition of approximately 920.0 million, net of cash acquired, was funded with term and revolving loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including a new 700.0 million incremental term loan, and cash on hand. 
 
 In October 2024, we entered into 685.0 million aggregate notional principal amount of Euro interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations for our Euro term loans under the Credit Agreement, which mature as follows: 35.0 million in October 2026, 70.0 million in October 2027 and 580.0 million in October 2030. These agreements have a weighted average fixed rate of 2.43 percent and were entered into with financial institutions which are expected to fully perform under the terms thereof. 
 
 On November 4, 2024, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into the Fifth Amendment with the Lenders therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. The Fifth Amendment: 
 
 refinanced outstanding term loans and revolving loans thereunder and extended the maturity dates to (i) November 4, 2029 with respect to revolving loans and (ii) November 4, 2030 with respect to term loans; 
 -26- 

increased the aggregate amount of Euro term loans thereunder from 700.0 million to 900.0 million, with the additional 200.0 million of Euro term loans being used to repay revolving loans under the Credit Agreement that were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for Weener and to pay fees, expenses and costs associated with the Fifth Amendment. 
 removed the springing maturity date provisions that would have shortened the maturity dates under the Credit Agreement to the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity dates of the 3 Senior Notes and 1.4 Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (unless such notes were refinanced or repaid prior thereto); 
 improved the interest rate margin grid for term loans; 
 increased the uncommitted multi-currency incremental loan facility from 1.25 billion to 1.5 billion; 
 amended certain covenants to provide additional flexibility; and 
 amended certain other terms of the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Pursuant to the Fifth Amendment, total term loans of 1,854.4 million are repayable as follows: 18.5 million in 2025, 92.7 million in 2026, 185.4 million in each of 2027, 2028 and 2029, and 1,187.0 million in 2030 (non-U.S. dollar debt has been translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date). 
 
 As a result of the Fifth Amendment, we expect to record a pre-tax charge of approximately 0.9 million for the loss on early extinguishment of debt during the quarter ending December 31, 2024. 
 
 You should also read Note 15 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included elsewhere in this quarterly report. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used net borrowings of revolving loans of 491.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of 274.4 million to fund cash used in operations of 213.9 million, decreases in outstanding checks of 160.6 million, the repayment of long-term debt of 100.0 million, net capital expenditures and other investing activities of 189.1 million, dividends paid on our common stock of 61.8 million, the repayment of principal amounts under finance leases of 27.3 million, repurchases of our common stock of 7.7 million and the negative effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of 5.6 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used net borrowings of revolving loans and proceeds from other foreign long-term debt of an aggregate of 847.5 million and cash and cash equivalents of 278.5 million (including the positive effect of exchange rate changes of 0.5 million) to fund cash used in operations of 596.0 million, repurchases of our common stock of 183.9 million, net capital expenditures and other investing activities of 170.6 million, decreases in outstanding checks of 61.4 million, dividends paid on our common stock of 59.7 million, the repayment of long-term debt of 52.7 million and the repayment of principal amounts under finance leases of 2.2 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 505.0 million of revolving loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement. After taking into account outstanding letters of credit, the available portion of revolving loans under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024 was 974.4 million. 
 
 Because we sell metal containers and closures used in fruit and vegetable pack processing, we have seasonal sales. As is common in the industry, we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the packing season. Due to our seasonal requirements, which generally peak sometime in the summer or early fall, we may incur short-term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements. Our peak seasonal working capital requirements have historically averaged approximately 375 million. We fund seasonal working capital requirements through revolving loans under the Credit Agreement, other foreign bank loans and cash on hand. We may use the available portion of revolving loans under the Credit Agreement, after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit, for other general corporate purposes including acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases and to refinance or repurchase other debt. 
 
 We believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under the Credit Agreement and other foreign bank loans will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs, planned capital expenditures, debt service, tax obligations, pension benefit plan contributions, share repurchases and common stock dividends for the foreseeable future. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, to finance any such acquisition. 
 
 We are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during 2024 with all of these covenants.

Supply Chain Finance Program 
 
 For our suppliers, we believe that we negotiate the best terms possible, including payment terms. In connection therewith, we initiated a SCF program with a major global financial institution. Under this SCF program, a qualifying supplier may elect, but is not obligated, to sell its receivables from us to such financial institution. A participating supplier negotiates its receivables sale arrangements directly with the financial institution under this SCF program. While we are not party to, and do not participate in the negotiation of, such arrangements, such financial institution allows a participating supplier to utilize our creditworthiness in establishing a credit spread in respect of the sale of its receivables from us as well as other applicable terms. This may provide a supplier with more favorable terms than it would be able to secure on its own. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in this SCF program and reaches an agreement with the financial institution, the supplier independently elects which individual invoices to us that they sell to the financial institution. All of our payments to a participating supplier are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date under our agreement with such supplier, regardless of whether the individual invoice was sold by the supplier to the financial institution. The financial institution then pays the supplier on the invoice due date under our agreement with such supplier for any invoices not previously sold by the supplier to the financial institution. Amounts due to a supplier that elects to participate in this SCF program are included in accounts payable in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the associated payments are reflected in net cash provided by operating activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Separate from this SCF program, we and suppliers who participate in this SCF program generally maintain the contractual right to require the other party to negotiate in good faith the existing payment terms as a result of changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates and general market liquidity, or in some cases for any reason. Outstanding trade accounts payables subject to this SCF program were approximately 284.2 million, 294.1 million and 330.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Guaranteed Securities

We use a disciplined approach to identify opportunities that generate attractive cash returns. Under our rationalization plans, we made cash payments of 31.2 million and 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan in 2019, remaining expenses and cash expenditures for our rationalization plans are expected to be 6.9 million and 9.5 million, respectively. Remaining expenses for the accretion of interest for the withdrawal liability related to the Central States Pension Plan are expected to average approximately 0.8 million per year and be recognized annually through 2040, and remaining cash expenditures for the withdrawal liability related to the Central States Pension Plan are expected to be approximately 2.6 million annually through 2040.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and, with respect to our international operations, in foreign currency exchange rates. In the normal course of business, we also have risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas. We employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks. Interest rate, foreign currency and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. 
 
 Information regarding our interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity pricing risk has been disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Since such filing, other than the changes discussed in Notes 7 and 15 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, there has not been a material change to our interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity pricing risk or to our policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls.
