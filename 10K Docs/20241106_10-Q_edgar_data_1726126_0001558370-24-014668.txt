 Management determined that substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired was concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets. Based on this determination, the acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Epsilon acquired assets that included the following: a interest in wellbores located in Eddy County, New Mexico for million. a working interest in gross acres in Ector County, Texas including the drilling of well for million and a commitment for the completion of that well for million. a working interest in gross acres in Ector County, Texas for million. 
 Property Impairment We perform a quantitative impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group's carrying amount may not be recoverable, over proved properties using the published NYMEX forward prices, basis differentials, timing, methods and other assumptions consistent with historical periods. When indicators of impairment are present, GAAP requires that the Company first compare expected future undiscounted cash flows by asset group to their respective carrying values. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, a reduction of the carrying amount of the properties to their estimated fair values is required. Additionally, if an exploratory well is determined not to have found proved reserves, the costs incurred, net of any salvage value, should be charged to expense. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, impairment was recorded.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA Epsilon defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before (1) net interest expense, (2) taxes, (3) depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, (4) impairments of natural gas and oil properties, (5) non-cash stock compensation expense, (6) gain or loss on sale of assets, (7) gain or loss on derivative contracts net of cash received or paid on settlement, and (8) net other income(expense). Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance as determined under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Epsilon has included Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because its management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information regarding its ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures. It further provides investors a helpful measure for comparing operating performance on a normalized or recurring basis with the performance of other companies, without giving effect to certain non-cash expenses and other items. This provides management, investors and analysts with comparative information for evaluating the Company in relation to other natural gas and oil companies providing corresponding non-U.S. GAAP financial measures or that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures for financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which is the most directly comparable measure of financial performance calculated under U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed carefully.

Gathering system revenue decreased 2.0 million, or 65 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in 2023. This was primarily the result of lower anchor shipper volumes due to natural decline in the wells and operator elected well shut-ins, offset partially by a 17 increase in the Auburn gathering rate. Revenues derived from transporting and compressing our production, which have been eliminated from gathering system revenues amounted to 0.3 million and 0.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 0.3 million and 1.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating Costs The following table presents total cost and cost per unit of production (Mcfe), including ad valorem, severance, and production taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Lease operating costs (net of elimination) 2,099,501 1,559,957 5,517,830 4,404,757 Gathering system operating costs 490,325 631,725 1,692,862 1,854,000 2,589,826 2,191,682 7,210,692 6,258,757 Upstream operating costs Total /Mcfe 1.22 0.79 1.00 0.66 Gathering system operating costs /Mcf 0.23 0.15 0.39 0.16 Operating costs include the effects of elimination entries to remove the gathering fees paid to Epsilon s ownership in the gathering system. Upstream operating costs consist of lease operating expenses necessary to extract natural gas and oil, including gathering and treating the natural gas and oil to ready it for sale. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 these costs increased by 1.1 million, or 25 , over the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the acquired and developed wells in the Permian Basin during the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 these costs increased by 0.5 million, or 35 , over the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the acquired and developed wells in the Permian Basin during the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2024. The higher unit operating costs in the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the higher liquids proportion of sales (Mcfe). Gathering system operating costs consist primarily of rental payments for the natural gas fueled compression units and overhead fees due to the system s operator. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gathering system operating costs were constant, decreasing by 0.2 million, or 9 from the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gathering system operating costs decreased by 0.1 million, or 22 from the same period in 2023. The decrease related to lower throughput volumes.

 Natural gas and oil and gathering system assets are depleted and depreciated using the units of production method aggregating properties on a field basis. For leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved and unproved properties, the reserve base used to calculate depreciation and depletion is total proved reserves. For natural gas and oil development and gathering system costs, the reserve base used to calculate depletion and depreciation is proved developed reserves. Depreciation expense includes amounts pertaining to our office furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, computer hardware. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 7 years. Also included in depreciation expense is an amount pertaining to buildings owned by the Company. Depreciation for the buildings is calculated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 30 years. Accretion expense is related to the asset retirement costs. DD A expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.3 million, or 94 , and 2.3 million, or 49 , respectively, from the same periods in 2023. This increase was a result of the new production in the Permian Basin and a lower reserve base in Pennsylvania used in the calculation, driven by lower SEC realized natural gas prices.

 Credit Agreement The Company closed a senior secured reserve based revolving credit facility on June 28, 2023 with Frost Bank as issuing bank and sole lender. The current commitment and borrowing base is 45 million (redetermined on June 25, 2024), supported by the Company s upstream assets and subject to semi-annual redeterminations with a maturity date of the earlier of June 28, 2027 or the date that the commitments are terminated. Interest will be charged at the Daily Simple SOFR rate plus a margin of 3.25 . The facility is secured by the assets of the Company s Epsilon Energy USA subsidiary (Borrower) and guaranteed by the Company and the other wholly owned subsidiaries. There are currently no borrowings under the facility. Under the terms of the facility, the Company must adhere to the following financial covenants: Current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 (current assets / current liabilities) Leverage ratio of less than 2.5 to 1.0 (total debt / income adjusted for interest, taxes and non-cash amounts) 
 Additionally, if the Leverage ratio is greater than 1.0 to 1.0, or the borrowing base utilization is greater than 50 , the Company is required to hedge 50 of the anticipated production from PDP reserves for a rolling 24 month period. Repurchase Transactions On March 20, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 2,191,320 common shares, representing 10 of the outstanding common shares of Epsilon at such time, for an aggregate purchase price of not more than US 12.0 million. The program is pursuant to a normal course issuer bid and will be conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The program commenced on March 27, 2024 and will end on March 26, 2025, unless the maximum amount of common shares is purchased before then or Epsilon provides earlier notice of termination. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 125,000 shares have been repurchased at a price of 5.00 per share (excluding commissions) under the new program. These shares are currently held in treasury and will be retired during the fourth quarter of 2024. The previous share repurchase program commenced on March 27, 2023 and ended on March 26, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 968,149 common shares at an average price of 5.08 per share (excluding commissions) under the previous plan. In 2024, we repurchased and retired 248,700 shares at a price of 4.82 per share (excluding commissions) before the plan terminated. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 373,700 shares at a price of 4.88 per share (excluding commissions) under the two consecutive repurchase programs. Derivative Transactions The Company has entered into hedging arrangements to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on operations. By reducing the price volatility from a portion of natural gas and crude oil production, the potential effects of changing prices on operating cash flows have been partially mitigated, but not eliminated. While mitigating the negative effects of falling commodity prices, these derivative contracts also limit the benefits we might otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company has no unpaid short term commitments for capital expenditures and has long term commitments of 15.2 million for asset retirement obligations. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings and cash flow are significantly affected by changes in the market price of commodities. The prices of natural gas and oil can fluctuate widely and are influenced by numerous factors such as demand, production levels, world political and economic events, and the strength of the US dollar relative to other currencies. Should the price of natural gas and oil decline substantially, the value of our assets could fall dramatically, impacting our future operations and exploration and development activities, along with our gas gathering system revenues. In addition, our operations are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including interest rate and certain exposure as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the United States. Gathering System Revenue Risk The Auburn Gas Gathering System lies within the Marcellus Basin with historically high levels of recoverable reserves and low cost of production. We believe that a short-term low commodity price environment will not significantly impact the reserves produced and thus the revenue of our gas gathering system. Interest Rate Risk Market risk is estimated as the change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate on the outstanding balance under our credit agreement. The credit agreement allows us to fix the interest rate. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the credit agreement was nil.

 Derivative Contracts The Company s financial results and condition depend on the prices received for production. Natural gas, natural gas liquids, and crude oil prices have fluctuated widely and are determined by economic and political factors. Supply and demand factors, including weather, general economic conditions, the ability to transport to other regions, as well as conditions in other regions, impact prices. Epsilon has established a hedging strategy and may manage the risk associated with changes in commodity prices by entering into various derivative financial instrument agreements and physical contracts. Although these commodity price risk management activities could expose Epsilon to losses or gains, entering into these contracts helps to stabilize cash flows and support the Company s capital spending program. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that of limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, the risk . PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
