Service revenue, which forms the other component of our total revenue, consists of interest we charge our franchisees on overdue customer accounts receivable, trademark license fees, and other fees for optional services we provide. We recognize interest income based on the effective interest rate applied to the outstanding principal balance of overdue accounts. License fees are charged to some locations that utilize our intellectual property that are not franchisees. License fees are of the gross margin for the location and are recognized when earned. We recognize revenue from optional services as we provide them.

revolving facility (the Senior Credit Facility ), which includes a sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. The Company also has a one -time right, upon at least ten Business Days prior written notice to the bank to increase the maximum amount of the Senior Credit Facility to million. As of September 30, 2024 this has not been exercised. The Senior Credit Facility provides for certain financial covenants including maintaining an Asset Coverage Ratio of at least 1.0:1.0 at all times; maintaining a Total Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio not exceeding 3.0:1.0; and maintaining, on a consolidated basis, a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.25:1.0. As of September 30, 2024 we were in compliance with all financial covenants. 
 
 Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance of the line of credit at a variable rate equal to (a) the Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin between and per annum. In each case, the applicable margin is determined by the Company's Total Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024 the effective interest rate was approximately . The Senior Credit Facility will mature on February 28, 2028. As part of the refinancing transaction we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , which is reflected on the line item, "Interest and other financing expense," in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 The Credit Agreement and other loan documents contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, and negative covenants, including without limitation, those covenants governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, restricting certain payments including dividends unless certain conditions are met, transactions with affiliates, investments, engaging in business other than the current business of the Company and all of its subsidiaries and business reasonably related thereto, and sale/leaseback transactions.

The Northbound term loan is unsecured and subordinated to the Senior Credit Facility. The Northbound term loan is payable in monthly installments beginning on April 1, 2022 until March 1, 2025.

per incident. Under these large deductible programs we are largely self-insured. Per our contractual agreements with ACE we must provide a collateral deposit of 
 million, which we accomplish by providing a letter of credit under our agreement with Bank of America. For workers compensation claims originating in the monopolistic jurisdictions of North Dakota, Ohio, Washington, and Wyoming, we pay workers compensation insurance premiums and obtain full coverage under mandatory state administered programs. Our liability associated with claims in these jurisdictions is limited to premium payments based upon the amount of payroll paid, or hours worked, within each jurisdiction. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements reflect only the mandated workers compensation insurance premium liability for workers compensation claims in these jurisdictions.

Prior to
 July 15, 2019, 
 one of our predecessor entities ("Legacy HQ") also obtained its workers compensation insurance through ACE in all states in which it operated other than monopolistic jurisdictions. The ACE policy was a high deductible policy pursuant to which Legacy HQ had primary responsibility for all claims with ACE providing insurance for covered losses and expenses in excess of
 thousand per incident. In addition to the ACE policy, Legacy HQ purchased a deductible reimbursement insurance policy from Hirequest Insurance Company HQ Ins. ), an independent captive insurer, to cover losses up to the
 thousand deductible with ACE. This resulted in Legacy HQ effectively being fully insured until the merger with Command Center. Effective
 July 15, 2019, Legacy HQ terminated its deductible reimbursement policy with HQ Ins. 

Command Center, the predecessor entity that acquired Legacy HQ in
 2019, also obtained its workers compensation insurance through ACE. Pursuant to Command Center s most recent policy, which expired on
 March 1, 2020, ACE provided insurance for covered losses and expenses in excess of
 500 thousand per incident. Command Center s ACE policy included a
 one -time obligation for the Company to pay any single claim filed under the Command Center policy within a policy year that exceeds
 500 thousand (if any), but only up to
 750 thousand for that claim. All other claims within the policy year were subject to the
 500 thousand deductible. Effective
 July 15, 2019, in connection with the merger with Command Center, we assumed all of the workers compensation claims of Command Center.

million. The goodwill impairment was primarily attributable to industry and market conditions effecting the overall financial performance of the reporting unit. These industry and market conditions were deemed a triggering event that led us to also review the fair value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the MRI reporting unit. As a result of this review we concluded the carrying value of the trade name related to MRI exceeded its estimated fair value resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million. The related impairment was primarily attributable to industry and market conditions effecting the overall financial performance of the reporting unit. The balance for the trade name related to MRI was approximately million and thousand at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 The combined impairment charge of approximately million is reflected in the line item, "Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge," in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are involved in various legal and administrative proceedings. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect material uninsured losses to arise from any of these matters. We believe the outcome of these matters, even if determined adversely, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There have been no material changes in our legal proceedings as of September 30, 2024 . 

Our effective tax rate for continuing operations during the
 three months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 
 September 30, 2023 was
 and
 , respectively. Our effective tax rate for continuing operations during the
 nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 and 
 September 30, 2023 was
 and
 , respectively. The primary reason for the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of
 and our effective income tax rate results from the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which is designed to encourage employers to hire workers from certain targeted groups with higher-than-average unemployment rates. Other differences result from state income taxes, certain non-deductible expenses, and tax effects of stock-based compensation.

We use an intra-period tax allocation to allocate total income tax expense or benefit to the different components of continuing operations and discontinued operations. This allocation uses a with and without methodology to determine income tax expense for discontinued operations. Tax benefit (expense) allocated to discontinued operations was

 Intangible assets associated with discontinued operations consist of a customer list with a net carrying value of approximately thousand on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 The net (loss) income from discontinued operations as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations was comprised of the following amounts (in thousands):

Notes receivable are generally secured by the assets of each office and the ownership interests in the franchise. We report interest income on notes receivable as interest income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest income was approximately thousand and thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively, and was approximately thousand and thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 We estimate the allowance for credit losses for franchisees separately from the allowance for credit losses from non-franchisees because of the level of detailed sales information available to us with respect to our franchisees. Based on our review of available collateral historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, we have established an allowance of approximately thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , for credit losses from franchisees.

Northbound Executive Search, MRI and SearchPath focus on executive, managerial, and professional recruitment services, although they also offer short-term consultant services. 

Our brands exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics. Therefore, we provide our services under a single operating division or segment. However, we strive to provide additional information and disclosures related to business models where appropriate. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had 416 franchisee-owned offices and 1 company-owned office in 43 states, the District of Columbia, and 13 countries outside of the United States, and we licensed our trade names to 6 offices in California .

We provide employment for an estimated 80 thousand temporary employees annually working for thousands of clients in many industries including construction, healthcare, recycling, warehousing, logistics, auctioneering, manufacturing, hospitality, landscaping, retail, and dental. 
 
 Management is pursuing a strategy that includes organic and acquisition growth components. Our organic growth strategy includes expanding existing client business, seeking out national and global account opportunities for our franchisees, access to capital for our franchisees to expand into new markets, and offering new franchises to qualified applicants. Part of this growth strategy includes an expansive training program for our franchisees to start, operate and grow their business. Our acquisition growth strategy includes identifying strategic, accretive, "tuck-in" acquisitions financed primarily through a combination of cash and debt (including seller financing), the issuance of equity in appropriate circumstances, and the use of earn-outs where efficient to protect the negotiated value and future cash flows. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 TEC, The Employment Company 
 On October 23, 2023 we entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of TEC, The Employment Company ("TEC") for approximately 9.8 million. TEC has 10 locations across Arkansas that provide light industrial, clerical, technical, and professional staffing services. Prior to our acquisition, TEC generated over 34 million in system wide sales during the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023. The acquisition of TEC expanded our presence in Arkansas and grew our franchise base, as we immediately entered into new franchise agreements and sold the all of assets acquired. We funded this acquisition with our Senior Credit Facility and the proceeds related to the near simultaneous franchising of operations.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents our net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, costs related to the work opportunity tax credit WOTC ), non-cash compensation and acquisition-related charges, net, and other charges and gains we consider non-recurring. We utilize Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes investors find it a useful tool to perform meaningful comparisons and evaluations of past, present, and future operating results. We believe it is a complement to net income and other financial performance measures. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent or replace net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure of performance prescribed by U.S. GAAP. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our financial performance because we believe interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, WOTC-related costs, non-cash compensation, acquisition-related charges, net and other non-recurring charges and gains bear little or no relationship to our operating performance. 

By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our operations. 

By excluding taxes on income, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations excluding factors that are beyond our control. 

By excluding depreciation and amortization expense, Adjusted EBITDA measures the financial performance of our operations without regard to their historical cost. 

By excluding WOTC related costs, Adjusted EBITDA provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations excluding the costs associated with qualifying for this tax credit. 

By excluding non-cash compensation, Adjusted EBITDA provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations excluding the value of our restricted stock and stock option awards. 

By excluding acquisition-related charges, net, Adjusted EBITDA provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations without regard to gains or losses that arise from acquisitions. 

By excluding other non-recurring charges and gains such as goodwill and intangible asset impairment, Adjusted EBITDA provides a basis for measuring financial performance without such items. 

In addition, our Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio, both of which include Adjusted EBITDA substantially as defined above. For all of these reasons, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides us, and investors, with information that is relevant and useful in evaluating our business. 
 
 However, because Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed and intangible assets. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt, nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our financing or changes in interest rates. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies that do not define Adjusted EBITDA exactly as we define the term. Because we use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our financial performance, we reconcile it to net income, which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP below (in thousands).

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenue 
 Our total revenue consists of franchise royalties and service revenue we receive from our franchises. Revenue would also include staffing revenue with respect to owned locations, when applicable. Once a company-owned office is sold, disposed of, or otherwise classified as held-for-sale, it would not be reflected in revenue and instead reported as Income from discontinued operations, net of tax. Revenue does not include any owned locations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 9.4 million compared to 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 1.6 . For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was a 2.6 million o r 1.8 decrease in underlying system-wide sales from 151.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 148.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in system-wide sales was primarily driven by a decline at MRI of 5.3 million partially offset by a 3.2 million increase for Snelling/HireQuest. Revenue as a percentage of system-wide sales was 6.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.1 for three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Franchise Royalties 
 Franchise royalties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 9.0 million, an increase of approximately 0.9 from 8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net effective royalty rate (as a percentage of external system-wide sales) was 6.1 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 5.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Our net effective ro yalty rate will generally fluctuate due to mix of business among the various royalty models under which we operate, as well as incentives we offer during the year. A summary of franchise royalties by brand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):

Service Revenue 
 Service revenue consists of interest we charge our franchisees on overdue customer accounts receivable and other miscellaneous fees for optional services we provide. Direct costs to provide certain services are reflected as a reduction in service revenue. As accounts receivable age over 42 days, our franchisees pay us interest on these accounts equal to 0.5 of the amount of the uncollected receivable each 14-day period. All accounts that age beyond 84 days are charged back to the franchisee and no longer incur interest, although some of our franchisees elect to charge back accounts that age over 42 days in order to avoid the interest charge. In addition to royalty fees, we also charge a license fee to some locations that utilize our intellectual property that are not franchisees. License fees are 9 of the gross margin for those locations. We have no employees and provide no services at the licensed locations. Service revenue also includes amounts charged for various optional services and cost-sharing arrangements such as bulk vendor programs or IT license blocks. Generally, we do not profit from these arrangements as they represent pass-through items, although there may be timing differences. In addition, there are occasionally classification differences where the cost is embedded in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 428 thousand, an increase of 62 thousand from the three months ended September 30, 2023, when service revenue was approximately 366 thousand. Interest income, which is included in service revenue was 197 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 197 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fluctuations in interest generally follow the mix of aged accounts in our accounts receivable , although relatively few age over 42 days and result in service revenue for us. Many of our franchisees have elected to charge back accounts early in order to avoid or reduce the interest charge. Therefore, there will not be a proportionally large increase in service revenue even when there is a large increase in accounts receivable. We pride ourselves on maintaining quality, creditworthy customers who pay timely. We view the imposition of higher interest rates on aged accounts receivable to serve as an incentive for our franchisees to select credit-worthy customers. Service revenue is expected to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.

Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 12.1 million compared to 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 5.0 million was primarily driven by a goodwill and intangible asset non-cash charge of 6.0 million related to the MRI acquisition- See Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets partially offset by a 1.0 million decrease in Workers compensation expense. Overall, operating expenses represented 8.2 of system-wide-sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 4.7 of system-wide sales in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Workers' Compensation 
 Workers' compensation expense was approximately 499 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 968 thousand when compared to a net expense of approximately 1.5 million recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our workers' compensation reserves provide benefits following a workplace injury. Benefits are usually statutory in nature and are generally provided in partial or complete replacement of the injured worker s recourse to the liability system. Payments may include medical treatment, rehabilitation, lost wages, and survivor benefits. Workers compensation rating is typically based on job classification, and our workers fall in hundreds of classifications. Annually, we use third-party actuaries to ensure that the overall ratings are sound, that individual insurer rates are adequate, and that individual risks receive a fair rate that reflects both the characteristics of the job classification and the Company's risk experience. The company pays premiums, actual claims, and establishes reserves for future claims. In turn we charge our franchises a percentage of payroll as determined by our workers' compensation carrier, plus or minus certain incentives and charges we provide for good or bad workers' compensation claims history. The overall charge is an estimate of the fully developed future costs and may not always coincide with the actual costs we incur resulting in expense or benefit in a given period. Over the long-term, our workers' compensation expense should equal the amounts we collect from franchisees and essentially be a pass-through cost. In the short-term, we cannot accurately predict the effects of workers' compensation in specific future periods, and historical trends are not indicative of future results. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 Compensation-related expenses include wages, payroll taxes, benefits, and stock-based compensation, and continue to be the largest component of operating expenses. Compensation and benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.8 million which is essentially flat compared to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses ("SG A") 
 Other SG A was 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.4 from 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 697 thousand compared to 699 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other Income and Expense 
 Other income and expense consists of interest income on notes receivable, rent received from sub-tenants, and other non-operating income and expense. 
 
 Other miscellaneous income (expense) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other miscellaneous expense was approximately 65 thousand, compared to other miscellaneous income of 117 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily driven by a gain on the disposal of a discontinued asset in the period ending September 30, 2023 and a loss of 100 thousand on the disposal of an intangible asset during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest income and expense 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 138 thousand compared to 83 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income represents interest related to the financing of franchised locations and the increase is due to the increase in Notes Receivables associated with the TEC acquisition in December 2023 as noted in Note 2-Acquisitions. 
 
 Interest and other financing expense relates primarily to the Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. Interest and other financing expense decreased from 302 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 268 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest and other financing expense will fluctuate as we utilize the line of credit for acquisitions or other short-term liquidity needs. The decrease in interest expense is consistent with the decrease in the outstanding line of credit balance. 
 
 Provision for income tax 
 Income tax benefit was approximately 725 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We estimate an annual projected effective tax rate ("ETR") for the year to determine income tax expense or benefit in the interim periods. The estimated annual ETR does not include tax effects from significant unusual or infrequently occurring items. Such items are accounted for discretely during the period in which they occur. The ETR is primarily driven by the federal WOTC, which is included as part of income tax expense because it can be claimed only on the income tax return and can be realized only through the existence of taxable income. Other significant items affecting our tax rate are windfall tax deductions related to stock-based compensation, and overall limits on executive compensation. Our net ETR for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.1 . 
 
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 518 thousand. Our net ETR for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 24.5 . The increase in the net ETR is driven by mix of our revenue, particularly the addition of MRI Network as the increase in executive, managerial and professional recruiting does not generate WOTC's at the same levels as staffing services. 
 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Following the acquisition of Dental Power, we used the platform to build a customer base in the dental-oriented sector of the staffing industry, which benefits our entire system by increasing revenue opportunities for all franchises under the HireQuest Health brand. Dental Power has national customers, and we did not have any plans to sell the operations as a single franchise or bifurcate it off into several geographical franchisees. It was not being marketed or otherwise held-for-sale. We operated Dental Power as a company-owned location reflected in continuing operations. As part of the MRI Network acquisition, their franchise base included a number of natural buyers who were already operating in the dental industry. We immediately began marketing Dental Power for sale to these and any other potential buyers. On March 27, 2023, we completed the sale of the assets we acquired in the Dental Power acquisition to an acquired MRI franchisee, who will continue to operate the business as part of their franchise. All operations of Dental Power while we operated the business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
 
 Following our acquisition of Dubin, we divided their operations into separate businesses and sold certain customer related assets of one of the acquired locations to a new franchisee. The remaining assets related to the operations of the other acquired location (in Philadelphia) have not been sold and as of September 30, 2024 remain classified as held-for-sale. In the meantime, we operate this Philadelphia location as company-owned, although all operations are presented as part of discontinued operations. 
 
 The assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations are presented separately in the asset and liability sections, respectively, of the balance sheet for all periods presented. Similarly, cash flows and the results of operations are also removed from continuing operations in the respective financial statements. In general, assets held-for-sale are not amortized or depreciated, and are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenue 
 Our total revenue consists of franchise royalties and service revenue we receive from our franchises. Revenue would also include staffing revenue with respect to owned locations, when applicable. Once a company-owned office is sold, disposed of, or otherwise classified as held-for-sale, it would not be reflected in revenue and instead reported as Income from discontinued operations, net of tax. Revenue does not include any owned locations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 26.5 million compared to 28.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 5.7 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a 31.9 million or 6.9 decrease in underlying system-wide sales when compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue as a percentage of system-wide sales was 6.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 6.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Total Revenue was primarily driven by a 23.6 million decrease in system-wide sales at MRI due to continued weakness in the staffing and recruiting sectors that MRI serves. 
 
 Franchise Royalties 
 Franchise royalties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 25.0 million, a decrease of 7.4 from 27.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the 2.0 million net decrease, ap proximately 1.1 million was related to the decrease in system-wide sales in MRI. O ur net effective royalty rate (as a percentage of external system-wide sales) was 5.8 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net effective royalty rate will generally fluctuate due to mix of business among the various royalty models under which we operate, as well as incentives we offer during the year. A summary of franchise royalties by brand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):

Service Revenue 
 Service revenue consists of interest we charge our franchisees on overdue customer accounts receivable and other miscellaneous fees for optional services we provide. Direct costs to provide certain services are reflected as a reduction in service revenue. As accounts receivable age over 42 days, our franchisees pay us interest on these accounts equal to 0.5 of the amount of the uncollected receivable each 14-day period. All accounts that age beyond 84 days are charged back to the franchisee and no longer incur interest, although some of our franchisees elect to charge back accounts that age over 42 days in order to avoid the interest charge. In addition to royalty fees, we also charge a license fee to some locations that utilize our intellectual property that are not franchisees. License fees are 9 of the gross margin for the location. We have no employees and provide no services at the licensed locations. Service revenue also includes amounts charged for various optional services and cost-sharing arrangements such as bulk vendor programs or IT license blocks. Generally, we do not profit from these arrangements as they represent pass-through items, although there may be timing differences. In addition, there are occasionally classification differences where the cost is embedded in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.5 million, an increase of 385 thousand from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, when service revenue was approximately 1.1 million. Interest income, which is included in service revenue was 570 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 659 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Fluctuations in interest generally follow the mix of aged accounts in our accounts receivable , although relatively few age over 42 days and result in service revenue for us. Many of our franchisees have elected to charge back accounts early in order to avoid or reduce the interest charge. Therefore, there will not be a proportionally large increase in service revenue even when there is a large increase in accounts receivable. We pride ourselves on maintaining quality, creditworthy customers who pay timely. We view the imposition of higher interest rates on aged accounts receivable to serve as an incentive for our franchisees to select credit-worthy customers. Service revenue is expected to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.

Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 24.4 million compared to 19.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 22.6 or 4.5 million. The increase primarily relates to a non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of 6.0 million partially offset by a 724 thousand reduction in Workers Compensation and a 1.1 million reduction in Compensation and Benefits. Overall, operating expenses including the goodwill and intangible impairment charge represented 5.7 of system-wide-sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Workers' Compensation 
 Workers' compensation expense was approximately 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 724 thousand when compared to a net expense of approximately 2.3 million recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our workers' compensation reserves provide benefits following a workplace injury. Benefits are usually statutory in nature and are generally provided in partial or complete replacement of the injured worker s recourse to the liability system. Payments may include medical treatment, rehabilitation, lost wages, and survivor benefits. Workers compensation rating is typically based on job classification, and our workers fall in hundreds of classifications. Annually, we use third-party actuaries to ensure that the overall ratings are sound, that individual insurer rates are adequate, and that individual risks receive a fair rate that reflects both the characteristics of the job classification and the Company's risk experience. The company pays premiums, actual claims, and establishes reserves for future claims. In turn we charge our franchises a percentage of payroll as determined by our workers' compensation carrier, plus or minus certain incentives and charges we provide for good or bad workers' compensation claims history. The overall charge is an estimate of the fully developed future costs and may not always coincide with the actual costs we incur resulting in expense or benefit in a given period. Over the long-term, our workers' compensation expense should equal the amounts we collect from franchisees and essentially be a pass-through cost. In the short-term, we cannot accurately predict the effects of workers' compensation in specific future periods, and historical trends are not indicative of future results. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 Compensation-related expenses include wages, payroll taxes, benefits, and stock-based compensation, and continue to be the largest component of operating expenses. Compensation and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 8.5 million compared to 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 11.1 due to a reduction in headcount and the associated salary, benefits, bonus and insurance costs. 
 
 Other Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses ("SG A") 
 Other SG A was 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 256 thousand or 4.3 from 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven primarily by a 436 thousand increase in Advertising Marketing expense partially off-set by a 172 thousand reduction in computer expenses and professional fees.

Depreciation and amortization 
 Other income and expense consists of interest income on notes receivable, rent received from sub-tenants, and other non-operating income and expense. 
 
 Other Income and Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was unchanged at approximately 2.1 million. 
 
 Other miscellaneous income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other miscellaneous income was approximately 12 thousand, compared to other miscellaneous income of 259 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The company received 158 thousand in rental income and 77 thousand from a gain on disposal of an intangible asset during the nine month period ending in September 30, 2023 compared to rental income of 76 thousand and a loss of 100 thousand on disposal of an intangible asset in the nine month period ending September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest income and expense 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 424 thousand compared to 197 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income represents interest related to the financing of franchised locations and the increase is due to the increase in Notes Receivables associated with the TEC acquisition in December 2023 as noted in Note 2-Acquisitions. 
 
 Interest and other financing expense relates primarily to the Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. Interest and other financing expense decreased from 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 763 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest and other financing expense will fluctuate as we utilize the line of credit for acquisitions or other short-term liquidity needs. The decrease in interest expense is consistent with the decrease in the outstanding line of credit balance and also due to a loss on debt extinguishment of 300 thousand that occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2023 associated with a refinancing. 
 
 Provision for income tax 
 Income tax expense was approximately 172 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We estimate an annual projected effective tax rate ("ETR") for the year to determine income tax expense or benefit in the interim periods. The estimated annual ETR does not include tax effects from significant unusual or infrequently occurring items. Such items are accounted for discretely during the period in which they occur. The ETR is primarily driven by the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit ("WOTC"), which is included as part of income tax expense because it can be claimed only on the income tax return and can be realized only through the existence of taxable income. Other significant items affecting our tax rate are windfall tax deductions related to stock-based compensation, and overall limits on executive compensation. Our net ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.7 . 
 
 Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 1.5 million. Our net ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 20.4 . The decrease in the net ETR is driven by mix of our revenue, particularly the addition of MRI Network as the increase in executive, managerial and professional recruiting does not generate Work Opportunity Tax Credits at the same levels as staffing services. 
 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Following the acquisition of Dental Power, we used the platform to build a customer base in the dental-oriented sector of the staffing industry, which benefits our entire system by increasing revenue opportunities for all franchises under the HireQuest Health brand. Dental Power has national customers, and we did not have any plans to sell the operations as a single franchise or bifurcate it off into several geographical franchisees. It was not being marketed or otherwise held-for-sale. We operated Dental Power as a company-owned location reflected in continuing operations. As part of the MRI Network acquisition, their franchise base included a number of natural buyers who were already operating in the dental industry. We immediately began marketing Dental Power for sale to these and any other potential buyers. On March 27, 2023, we completed the sale of the assets we acquired in the Dental Power acquisition to an acquired MRI franchisee, who will continue to operate the business as part of their franchise. All operations of Dental Power while we operated the business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
 
 Following our acquisition of Dubin, we divided their operations into separate businesses and sold certain customer related assets of one of the acquired locations to a new franchisee. The remaining assets related to the operations of the other acquired location (in Philadelphia) have not been sold and as of September 30, 2024 remain classified as held-for-sale. In the meantime, we operate this Philadelphia location as company-owned, although all operations are presented as part of discontinued operations. 
 
 The assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations are presented separately in the asset and liability sections, respectively, of the balance sheet for all periods presented. Similarly, cash flows and the results of operations are also removed from continuing operations in the respective financial statements. In general, assets held-for-sale are not amortized or depreciated, and are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 Our major source of liquidity and capital is cash generated from our ongoing operations consisting of royalty revenue, service revenue and staffing revenue from franchisee-owned locations. We also receive principal and interest payments on notes receivable that we issued in connection with the conversion of company-owned or acquired offices to franchised offices. 
 
 At , our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately 23.3 million. Our current assets included approximately 1.6 million of cash and 50.5 million of net accounts receivable, which our franchisees have billed to customers and which we own in accordance with our franchise agreements. Our largest current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 included approximately 11.0 million due to our franchisees on pending settlement statements, 3.7 million related to our workers compensation claims liability, and 13.4 million of borrowings under our line of credit. 
 
 Our working capital requirements are driven largely by temporary employee payroll, which is typically daily or weekly, and weekly cash settlements with our franchises. Since collections from accounts receivable lag employee pay our working capital requirements increase as system-wide sales increase, and vice-versa. When the economy contracts, our cash balance tends to increase in the short-term as payroll funding requirements decrease and aged accounts receivable are converted to cash upon collection. As the economy recovers, our cash balance generally decreases and accounts receivable increase. 
 
 We believe that our current cash balance, together with the future cash generated from operations, principal and interest payments on notes receivable, and our borrowing capacity under our line of credit, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, future dividends (if any), and other liquidity requirements associated with our continuing operations for the next 12 months. We also believe that these sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with our continuing operations beyond the next 12 months. 
 
 Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors including overall liquidity in the capital or credit markets, the state of the economy and our credit strength as viewed by potential lenders. We cannot provide assurances that we will have future access to the capital or credit markets on acceptable terms. We expect our borrowing costs to continue to increase as the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rates in an effort to control inflation. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by continuing operating activities was approximately 3.5 million and included net income from continuing operations of approximately 1.6 million, adjusted by non-cash items (primarily the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, depreciation, stock-based compensation, amortization of approximately 8.4 million. These provisions were offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities requiring cash of approximately 6.5 million, including an increase in accounts receivable of 6.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by continuing operating activities was approximately 1.8 million and included net income from continuing operations of approximately 6.0 million, adjusted by non-cash items of approximately 3.8 million. These provisions were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities requiring cash of approximately 7.9 million.

Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash generated by investing activities was approximately 557 thousand, primarily from payments on notes receivable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash generated by investing activities was approximately 310 thousand. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used by financing activities was approximately 3.7 million and included net payments on our revolving line of credit of approximately 717 thousand and the payment of approximately 2.5 million in dividends. During the period ended September 30, 2023, cash used by financing activities was approximately 4.0 million and included the payment of dividends totaling approximately 2.5 million and payments on our term loan of approximately 3.3 million partially offset by net proceeds from our revolving line of credit of 1.9 million. 
 Revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. 
 On February 28, 2023 the Company and all of its subsidiaries as borrowers (collectively, the "Borrowers") entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the "Bank") for a 50,000,000 revolving facility (the Senior Credit Facility ), which includes a 20,000,000 sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. The Company also has a one-time right, upon at least ten business days prior written notice to the Bank to increase the maximum amount of the Senior Credit Facility to 60 million. The Senior Credit Facility provides for certain financial covenants including an Asset Coverage Ratio of at least 1.0:1.0 at all times; maintaining a Total Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio not exceeding 3.0:1.0; and maintaining, on a consolidated basis, a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.25:1.0. Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance of the line of credit at a variable rate equal to (a) the Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate plus a margin between 1.00 and 1.75 per annum. In each case, the applicable margin is determined by the Company's Total Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). The Senior Credit Facility will mature on February 28, 2028. 
 
 The Credit Agreement and other loan documents contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, and negative covenants, including without limitation, those covenants governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, restricting certain payments including dividends unless certain conditions are met, transactions with affiliates, investments, engaging in business other than the current business of the Borrowers and business reasonably related thereto, and sale/leaseback transactions. The Credit Agreement and other loan documents also contain customary events of default including, without limitation, payment default, material breaches of representations and warranties, breach of covenants, cross-default on material indebtedness, certain bankruptcies, certain ERISA violations, material judgments, change in control, termination or invalidity of any guaranty or security documents, and defaults under other loan documents. The obligations under the Credit Agreement and other loan documents are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers as collateral including, without limitation, their accounts and notes receivable, intellectual property and the real estate owned by HQ Real Property Corporation. 
 
 The Company utilized the proceeds of the Senior Credit Facility (i) first to pay off its existing credit agreement with Truist (described below), (ii) second, to pay off its existing term loan with Truist (described below), and (iii) third, to pay transaction fees and expenses incurred in connection with closing the transactions described above. The Company intends to utilize the proceeds of any loans made under the Senior Credit Facility for working capital, required letters of credit, and general corporate purposes in accordance with the terms of the Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, availability under the Senior Credit Facility was approximately 26.9 million based on eligible collateral, less letter of credit reserves, bank product reserves, and current advances, assuming continued covenant compliance. Our all-in-rate of borrowing was 6.2 and is repriced daily. On October 23, 2023, we entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of TEC Staffing Services, Inc. ("TEC") for approximately 9.8 million.

Economy and Inflation 
 
 The U.S. economy has suffered from high rates of inflation in recent years. We do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our Company s results of operations as inflation generally results in higher rates per hour that can offset any slowdown in organic growth opportunities. This might not be the case if inflation continues to grow. A prolonged period of high inflation may also impact our ability to carry out our acquisition strategy. On the other hand, if business conditions deteriorate, it may be easier for us to identify an acquisition candidate. 
 
 The February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, along with certain international organizations, have significantly impacted the global economy, including exacerbating inflationary pressures created by COVID-related supply chain disruptions, and given rise to potential global security issues that have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect international business and economic conditions. The ongoing effects of the hostilities and sanctions are no longer limited to Russia and Russian companies and have spilled over to and negatively impacted other regional and global economic markets. 
 
 In October 2023, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel, who in turn formally declared war as its soldiers battled Hamas fighters and launched airstrikes on Gaza. This war between Israel and Hamas could spur inflation and hamper global growth if it turns into a wider conflict that causes a significant increase in oil prices. 
 
 Global conflicts such as these have resulted in rising energy prices and an even more constrained supply chain, and thus aggravated the inflationary global environment with cost increases affecting labor, fuel, materials food and services. At this time, the ultimate extent of the duration of the military actions, resulting sanctions and future economic and market disruptions, and resulting effects on the Company, and on our acquisition strategy, are impossible to predict. 
 
 Key Performance Indicator: System-Wide Sales 
 
 We refer to total sales generated by our franchisees as franchise sales. For any period prior to their conversion to franchises, we refer to sales at company-owned and operated offices as company-owned sales. In turn, we refer to the sum of franchise sales and company-owned sales as system-wide sales. In other words, system-wide sales include sales at all offices, whether owned and operated by us or by our franchisees. In addition, system-wide sales includes sales at company-owned offices that are classified as discontinued operations. System-wide sales is a key performance indicator, although we do not record system-wide sales as revenue. Management believes that information on system-wide sales is important to understanding our financial performance because those sales are the basis on which we calculate and record much of our franchise royalty revenue, are directly related to all other royalty revenue and service revenue and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. Management uses system-wide sales to benchmark current operating levels to historic operating levels. System-wide sales should not be considered as an alternative to revenue. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, nearly all of our offices were franchised with the only exceptions being a portion of the Dubin operations acquired in the first quarter of 2022. The following table reflects our system-wide sales broken into its components for each period indicated. The Dubin operations are presented in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations because they are considered held-for-sale, but their system-wide sales are reflected along with all other offices in the table below. Percentages indicate the change in system-wide sales relative to the comparable prior period (in thousands, except percentages):

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is subject to annual impairment testing that is conducted each calendar year in the third quarter. The goodwill asset impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. Interim tests during the year may be required if an event occurs or circumstances change (a "triggering event") that in management's judgement would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. 
 
 To estimate fair value, we may use both a discounted cash flow and a market valuation approach. The discounted cash flow approach uses cash flow projections and a discount rate to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit while the market approach relies on market multiples of similar companies. The key assumptions used for the discounted cash flow approach include projected revenues and profit margins, changes in working capital, and the current discount and tax rates. For the market approach, we select a group of peer companies that we believe are best representative of each reporting unit. 
 
 Annual assessments are conducted in the context of information that is reasonably available to us as of the date of the assessment including our best estimates of future sales volumes and prices; labor cost and availability; operational efficiency, and the then current discount rates and tax rates. We performed our annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31, 2024. 
 
 Other intangible assets are recorded at cost or, when acquired as a part of a business combination, at estimated fair value. These assets include customer relationships, technology-related assets, trademarks, and other intellectual property. Intangible assets that have definite lives are amortized using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed or the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 5 to 15 years. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to at least annual impairment testing, which are conducted each calendar year in the fourth quarter. The impairment testing compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount using the relief from royalty method or the comparable sales method, depending on the asset. The relief from royalty method uses cash flow projections and a discount rate to calculate the fair value of intellectual property while the comparable sales approach relies on recent sales of similar assets by unrelated companies. The key assumptions used for the relief from royalty method include projected revenues and profit margins, an assumed royalty rate, and the current discount and tax rates. For the comparable sales approach, we rely on public reports of recent sales that we believe are best representative of each asset being evaluated. 
 
 Interim tests may be required if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value or change the useful life of the asset. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. These changes could result in future impairments. 
 
 In addition, see Part II, Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and, as such, are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of such period as a result of the material weakness disclosed below. 
 
 As previously reported, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as we did not have sufficient accounting resources available to handle the volume of technical accounting issues and provide adequate review functions. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Notwithstanding the material weakness, which still existed as of September 30, 2024 , the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Management Plans to Remediate Material Weakness 
 Beginning with our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 the Company reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as we did not have sufficient accounting resources available to handle the volume of technical accounting issues and provide adequate review functions in connection with the integration of acquisitions. As part of the remediation, the Company has engaged third party professionals with appropriate technical expertise for subsequent acquisitions. Also, in order to give the Chief Accounting Officer CAO more time to do an appropriate review as and when required, the Company has transitioned the CAO s responsibility over the Finance Operations Group which processes and reconciles daily transactions to another leader in the organization. In addition, the Company is actively recruiting for additional staff in the accounting department with appropriate professional experience and in November 2023, hired a Chief Financial Officer CFO who has 17 years of experience as a public company CFO and 5 years of experience as a public company director including as Audit Committee Chair. Based on our recruiting efforts in October the Company hired a Senior Accountant with 9 years of accounting experience. Lastly, the Company is working through the accounting processes currently the responsibility of the CAO with the goal of (1) making the processes more efficient and (2) transitioning work from the CAO to other appropriately experienced accounting staff. 
 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated as soon as possible. We have made significant progress towards remediation and continue to implement our remediation plan for the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above. We will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting, other than those referred to above, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time we are involved in various legal and administrative proceedings. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect material uninsured losses to arise from any of these matters. We believe the outcomes of these proceedings, even if determined adversely, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 21, 2024. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
