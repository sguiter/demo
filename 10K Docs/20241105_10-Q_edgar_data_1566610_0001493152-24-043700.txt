CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (this Quarterly Report ), includes forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which statements are subject to considerable
risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not statements of historical
facts and can be identified by words such as anticipates, believes, could, estimates, 
 expects, intends, may, plans, potential, predicts, 
 projects, seeks, should, will, would or similar expressions and
the negatives of those expressions. Forward-looking statements also include the assumptions underlying or relating to such statements. 

Our
forward-looking statements are based on our management s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations about future events and
trends, which affect or may affect our business, strategy, operations, financial performance or liquidity. Although we believe these
forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties
and are made in light of information currently available to us. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may impact our forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, the following factors: 

our incursion of significant net losses and uncertainty whether we will achieve or maintain profitable operations; 

our ability to grow and compete in the future, and to execute our business strategy; 

our ability to maintain and expand our customer base and to convince our customers to increase the use of our services and/or platform; 

the competitive market in which we operate; 

our ability to increase the number of our strategic relationships or grow the revenues received from our current strategic relationships; 

our ability to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological
developments; 

our ability to successfully launch new product platforms, including MARKET.live, the rate of adoption of these platforms and the revenue
generated from these platforms; 

our ability to deliver our services, as we depend on third party Internet providers; 

our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel; 

our susceptibility to security breaches and other disruptions; 

our ability to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market; and 

the impact of, and our ability to operate our business and effectively manage our growth under evolving and uncertain global economic,
political, and social trends, including legislation banning or otherwise hampering our strategic relationships such as TikTok, inflation,
rising interest rates, and recessionary concerns. 

The
foregoing list may not include all of the factors that impact the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report. Our actual
financial condition and results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result
of various additional factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report and in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our Annual Report ), as well as in the other reports we
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). You should read this Quarterly Report, and the other documents
we file with the SEC, with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from the results expressed or
implied by our forward-looking statements. 

We
operate in an evolving environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to
predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual future results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking
statements. 

Forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date they were made, and, except to the extent required by law or the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market,
we undertake no obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement because of new information, future events or other factors. 

We
qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

of the gross sales revenue for all products sold. 

Historically,
and continuing up through June 13, 2023, the Company was a Software-as-a-Service SaaS applications platform
developer that offered a SaaS platform for the direct sales industry comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales
enablement business software products marketed on a subscription basis, (the SaaS Assets ). 

On
June 13, 2023, the Company disposed of all of its operating SaaS Assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of the
sum of , of which was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction (the Sale of the SaaS Assets ).
Additional payments of will be paid to us by the buyer if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within the two-year
period following the closing as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. The sale of the SaaS Assets was undertaken
to allow us to focus our resources on MARKET.live, and the business verticals that platform could support. We expect our burgeoning MARKET.live
business unit will, over time, create greater shareholder value than we could have been created through the continued operation of our
SaaS Assets. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of and short-term investments of . 

Economic
Disruption 

Our
business is dependent in part on general economic conditions. Many jurisdictions in which our customers are located and our products
are sold have experienced and could continue to experience unfavorable general economic conditions, such as inflation, increased interest
rates and recessionary concerns, which could negatively affect demand for our products. Under difficult economic conditions, customers
may seek to cease spending on our current products or fail to adopt our new products, which could negatively affect our financial performance.
We cannot predict the timing or magnitude of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of any economic recovery. These and other
economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of our common stock, 
par value per share (the Common Stock ). . The number of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options, warrants, and
convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of two hundred and the exercise price of such securities increased by a factor of
two hundred, as of October 8, 2024. All historical share and per-share amounts reflected throughout our condensed consolidated financial
statements and other financial information in this Quarterly Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The par value
per share of our Common Stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. 

As
discussed above, among the terms of the Sale of the SaaS Assets was that additional payments of will be paid to us by the buyer
if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within the two-year period following the closing. The contingent payments were not
recorded at the closing date of the sale and will be recognized as the cash is received and the contingency resolved pursuant to ASC
450-30. 

Accordingly,
the Company s consolidated financial statements are being presented pursuant to ASC 360-10-45-9 which requires that a disposal
group be classified as held for sale in the period in which all of the held for sale criteria are met. In addition to held for sale accounting,
the Company had also met the criterion pursuant to ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations , as a strategic shift from operating and
managing a SaaS business to operating and managing a live streaming shopping platform has occurred because of the sale. The Company s
consolidated results of operations and statements of cash flows have been reclassified to reflect the presentation of discontinued operations.
See Note 6 for details of the assets and liabilities related to the SaaS sale and discontinued operations. 

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to
fairly present the Company s financial position and results of operations for the interim periods reflected. Except as noted, all
adjustments contained herein are of a normal recurring nature. Results of operations for the fiscal periods presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of fiscal year-end results. 

of the gross sales revenue for all products sold. 

A
performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are
identified based on the goods that will be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the
contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Performance obligations include
establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company s e-commerce platform and customer service
support. 

Customers
do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects
the contractual consideration that the Company receives in exchange for its services. 

Revenue
is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency
relationship with its customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company
does not take possession of the customers inventory or any credit risks relating to the products sold. 

Sales
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded
from net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
were substantially all generated from clients and customers located within the United States of America.

to their original terms and as such Nasdaq suspended trading the remaining warrants and the trading symbol VERBW was delisted from

Fair
Value Measurements 

Our
financial instruments include cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The fair value of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values due to their short-term
nature, which are all considered Level 1. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying
value. 

Our
financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds and derivatives
(see Note 8). U.S. treasury securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued based on quoted market
price in an active market. Corporate bonds are valued based on quoted prices in markets that are less active and are generally classified
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not hold Level 1 or Level 2 financial instruments as of December 31, 2023. 

Financial
instruments valued based on unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions or data that market participants
would use in valuing an instrument are generally classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not hold Level 3 financial
instruments as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

in the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles on November 20, 2019, styled Meyerson v. Verb Technology Company, Inc.,
et al. (Case No. 19STCV41816). The Company disputed the former employee s claims and interposed several affirmative defenses, including
that the claims are contradicted by documentary evidence, barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and barred by a written, executed
release. On February 9, 2021, the former employee s counsel filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary
adjudication against the Company. On October 13, 2021, the California court issued an order (i) denying the former employee s motion
for summary judgment on his claims against the Company, but (ii) granting the former employee s motion to dismiss the Company s
affirmative defenses, which ruling the Company contends was in error. Under the rules, the Company is precluded from appealing the dismissal
of its affirmative defenses until after a trial. On August 29, 2023, after a bench trial at which the Company was precluded from introducing
evidence of its affirmative defenses, the court found in favor of Plaintiff Meyerson; and judgment was entered in Meyerson s favor

affirmative defenses be reinstated. As of this date, the appeal has yet to be heard. In the interim, the Company bonded the judgement

proxy statement on Schedule PRER14A indicating that in the event the Company does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule on or
before September 26, 2024, then at the annual meeting, the Company intends to seek the approval of its stockholders to implement a . 

On

below per share for the 10-consecutive trading day period ended August 5, 2024 and, accordingly, the Company is subject to the
provisions contemplated under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) (the Low Priced Stock Rule and its securities were
subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ). 

On
August 12, 2024, the Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which request automatically stayed any further action by Nasdaq
until the hearing was held and the expiration of any extension period that may have been granted by the Panel. The Company s common
stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol VERB pending completion of the hearing process. 

On
August 28, 2024, the Panel determined to grant the Company a temporary exception until October
21, 2024, to effect a reverse stock split of its common stock and thereafter regain compliance with The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC s
Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On October 2, 2024, the Panel amended the exception granted to the Company
to provide that the Company has until October 22, 2024, to effect a reverse stock split to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule
5550(a)(2).

the September 26, 2024 annual meeting, the Company s stockholders voted to approve a reverse
stock split within a range of one-for-five (1-for-5) to a maximum of a one-for-two hundred (1-for-200). Given the then price of the Company s
shares and the limited time frames established by the Panel, on October 8, 2024 the Board implemented a

Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary
Performance Agreements 

As of the
date of this Form 10-Q, the Company s shares have traded and are continuing to trade at a price that results in a market cap
that is significantly less than the Company s current net cash position. Accordingly, the Company s Board of Directors
has determined that the Company is vulnerable to hostile takeover action and that any such action at this time is not in the best
interests of its stockholders. The Company does not currently have any poison pill type provisions and due to previous reverse stock
splits and other capital markets activities, the Company s management and board members currently own an insignificant number
of shares and as such would be ineffective in voting such shares to thwart any hostile takeover actions. Until such time as the
Board determines whether it is necessary or advisable to adopt a poison pill provision or other anti-takeover measure, on October 31, 2024 the Board determined to
approve the entry into Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreements (the Agreement with Rory J.

Overview 

Our
business is currently comprised of three distinct, yet complimentary business units, all three of which are currently operating and generating
revenue, and one of which is currently operating in stealth mode as we continue to refine the user experience for that
business unit as we continue to ramp sales. The first business unit is MARKET.live focused on interactive video-based social commerce.
Our MARKET.live platform is a multi-vendor, livestream social shopping destination leveraging the convergence of ecommerce and entertainment.
Brands, retailers and creators that join MARKET.live have the ability to broadcast livestream shopping events simultaneously on numerous
social media channels, including TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, as well as on MARKET.live, reaching exponentially
larger audiences. The Company s recent technological integrations with META, created a seamless, native, friction-free checkout
process for Facebook and Instagram users to purchase MARKET.live vendors products within each of those popular apps. This integration
allows Facebook and Instagram users to browse products featured in MARKET.live shoppable videos, place products in a native shopping
cart and checkout all without leaving Facebook or Instagram. We recently announced a technology integration with Pinterest and
we will continue to expand the universe of social platforms our clients can access through our platform. 

Last
year we completed development work on a new MARKET.live capability that facilitated a deeper integration into the TikTok Shop social
media platform, designed to expose MARKET.live shoppable programming to tens of millions of potential viewers/purchasers. This capability
allows shoppers watching a MARKET.live stream on TikTok to stay on that site and check out through that site, eliminating the friction
or reluctance of TikTok users to leave their TikTok feed in order to complete their purchase on MARKET.live. Our technology integration
allows the purchase data to flow back through MARKET.live and to the individual vendors and stores on MARKET.live seamlessly for fulfillment
of the orders. 

26 

Earlier
this year, we announced an expanded strategic relationship with TikTok evidenced by a formal partnership with TikTok Shop pursuant to
which MARKET.live became a service provider for TikTok Shop and officially designated as a TikTok Shop Partner (TSP) . Under the terms
of the partnership, TikTok Shop refers consumer brands, retailers, influencers and affiliates leads to MARKET.live for a menu of MARKET.live
contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other things, assistance in onboarding to TikTok Shop and establishing
a TikTok store, hosting training sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative services including content
creation and full remote and in-studio production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements
for existing TikTok clients stores. The same services are currently provided to consumer brands that contact us directly or through
several brand agencies with which we maintain affiliate relationships. 

The
second business unit is GO FUND YOURSELF!, a revolutionary interactive social crowd funding platform for public and private companies
seeking broad-based exposure across numerous social media channels for their crowd-funded Regulation CF and Regulation A offerings. The
platform combines a ground-breaking interactive TV show with MARKET.live s back-end capabilities allowing viewers to tap on their
screen to facilitate an investment, in real time, as they watch companies presenting before the show s panel of Titans .
Presenting companies that sell consumer products are able to offer their products directly to viewers during the show in real time through
shoppable onscreen icons. The Go Fund Yourself business unit generates revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show
and for marketing, ad, and content creation and distribution services. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the
show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25 of the gross sales revenue for all products sold. 

Historically,
and continuing up through June 13, 2023, we were a Software-as-a-Service SaaS applications platform developer that offered
a SaaS platform for the direct sales industry comprised of a suite of interactive video-based sales enablement business software products
marketed on a subscription basis, (the SaaS Assets ). 

On
June 13, 2023, the Company disposed of all of its operating SaaS Assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement in consideration of the
sum of 6,500, 4,750 of which was paid in cash by the buyer at the closing of the transaction (the Sale of the SaaS Assets ).
Additional payments of 1,750 will be paid by the buyer if certain profitability and revenue targets are met within the two-year period
following the closing as set forth more particularly in the asset purchase agreement. The sale of the SaaS Assets was undertaken to allow
us to focus our resources on MARKET.live, and the business verticals that platform could support. We expect our burgeoning MARKET.live
business unit will, over time, create greater shareholder value than we could have been created through the continued operation of our
SaaS Assets. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 10,515 and short-term investments of 5,077. 

Customers
do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects
the contractual consideration that the Company receives in exchange for its services. The Company does not take possession of the customers 
inventory or any credit risks relating to the products sold. 

Sales
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded
from net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
were substantially all generated from clients and customers located within the United States of America.

Revenue 

Revenue
was 128 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 29 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue
of 99, representing an increase of 341 over the same period last year is primarily attributable to revenue received through the Company s
partnership with TikTok and the TikTok related and other services packages within the Company s MARKET.live business unit, and
from the Company s Go Fund Yourself business unit. 

Operating
Expenses 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses were 273 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 564 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease is due to a revision in the amortization of software development costs resulting from extending the life of the
asset on January 1, 2024. 

General
and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense were 2,113 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 2,850 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 737 or 26 , in general and administrative expenses including
stock compensation expense is primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense and legal fees. 

Other
Income, net 

Other
income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 347, which was primarily attributable to interest income.

Revenue 

Revenue
was 172 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue of
 138, representing an increase of 406 , is primarily attributable to revenue received through the Company s partnership with TikTok
and the TikTok related and other services packages within the Company s MARKET.live business unit, and from the Company s
Go Fund Yourself business unit. 

Operating
Expenses 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses were 798 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,730 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease is due to a revision in the amortization of software development costs resulting from extending the life of the
asset on January 1, 2024. 

General
and administrative expenses including stock compensation expense were 7,218 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 9,080 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1,862 or 21 in general and administrative expenses including
stock compensation expense is primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense and a decrease in legal fees. 

Other
Income, net 

Other
income, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 793, which was primarily attributable to other income, net of 648 and
interest income, net of 234, both offset by financing costs of 90. 

Use
of Non-GAAP Measures Modified EBITDA 

In
addition to our results under generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), we present Modified EBITDA as a
supplemental measure of our performance. However, Modified EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be
considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP
or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as net income
(loss), plus depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, interest (income) expense, unrealized gain on short-term
investments, financing costs, change in fair value of derivative liability, other (income) expense, loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, and other non-recurring charges. 

Management
considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of
the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results prepared
in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate
for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same
as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not be construed as an inference
that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Represents litigation and severance costs. 

We
present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on
a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified
EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in
evaluating potential acquisitions; and in making compensation decisions and in communications with our board of directors concerning
our financial performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following: 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on
 our debts; and 

Although
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in
 the future, and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require that we make certain assumptions and estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses
during each reporting period. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reported periods. Significant estimates include assumptions made for assumptions made in valuing assets acquired in business combinations,
impairment testing of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assumptions used in valuing derivative liabilities,
assumptions used in valuing share-based compensation, and accruals for contingent liabilities. Amounts could materially change in the
future. 

Investments 

In
accordance with ASC 320, Investments Debt Securities , the Company accounts for its investments
as trading securities consisting of U.S. Treasury securities and corporate bonds that are reported at fair value on the Company s
condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included in other income
(expense), net within the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

The Company s investments
in trading securities are classified as current based on the intent of management, the nature of the investments and their availability
for use in current operations. 

Capitalized
Software Development Costs 

The
Company capitalizes internal and external costs directly associated with developing internal-use software ,
and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license, during the application development stage of its projects. The
Company s internal-use software is reported at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization begins once the project has been
completed and is ready for its intended use. 

Due to changes in
management s assessment of its capitalized software development asset, the Company revised the asset s remaining useful life
effective January 1, 2024 and will amortize the asset on a straight-line basis over a period of four years. Software maintenance activities
or minor upgrades are recorded as expense in the period performed. 

Amortization
expense related to capitalized software development costs is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements
of operations. 

Segment
Information 

Effective July 1, 2024, the Company operates as two reportable segments, MARKET.live and Go Fund Yourself .
We identify our segments in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, and in the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer,
as our chief operating decision maker CODM ), allocates resources and assesses financial performance. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s FASB ASC 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when
considering the terms of contract(s), which includes (1) identifying the contract(s) or agreement(s) with a customer, (2) identifying
our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price
to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. 

MARKET.live
revenue is derived from contract-based recurring fee revenue services that include, among other 
 things, assistance in onboarding clients to TikTok Shop and establishing a TikTok store, hosting training
sessions and webinars for prospective TikTok Shop sellers, full creative services including content creation and full remote and in-studio
production services, host/influencer casting and management, TikTok Shop maintenance and enhancements for existing TikTok clients 
stores. Clients are referred to us through our existing partnership with TikTok Shop as well as from several brand agencies with which
we maintain affiliate relationships. 

GO FUND YOURSELF!
derives revenue from cash fees we charge to issuers to appear on the show and for marketing, ad, and content creation and distribution
services. For those issuers that sell products during each airing of the show through our platform, we charge a fee up to 25 of the gross
sales revenue for all products sold. 

A
performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product. Performance obligations promised in a contract are
identified based on the goods that will be transferred that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the
contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Performance obligations include
establishing and maintaining customer online stores, providing access to the Company s e-commerce platform and customer service
support. 

The
Company s revenue is generated primarily from services it provides as referenced above in the Revenue Recognition section. Customers
do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company s software. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects
the contractual consideration that the Company receives in exchange for its services. 

Revenue
is recognized on a net basis from maintaining e-commerce platforms and online orders, as the Company is engaged primarily in an agency
relationship with its customers and earns defined amounts based on the individual contractual terms for the customer and the Company
does not take possession of the customers inventory or any credit risks relating to the products sold. 

Sales
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded
from net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. 

33 

Derivative
Financial Instruments 

We
evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair
value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations.
The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated
at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current
based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

We
use Level 2 inputs for our valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using a Binomial
pricing model. Our derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the
fair value being recorded in the results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives. 

Share-Based
Compensation 

The
Company issues stock options and warrants, shares of common stock and restricted stock units as share-based compensation to employees
and non-employees. The Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock
Compensation . Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is
recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of
shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and is recognized as expense over the service period. Forfeitures are accounted
for as they occur. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company had paid
cash for services. 

Intangible
Assets 

We
have certain intangible assets that were initially recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition. The finite-lived intangible
assets consist of developed technology and customer contracts. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of domain names. Intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of five years. 

We
review all finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess carrying value over the fair
value in our consolidated statements of operations.

ITEM
4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 

These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a
simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

10b5-1 Trading Arrangement 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement 
or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K. 

Corporate
Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreements 

As
of the date of this Form 10-Q, the Company s shares have traded and are continuing to trade at a price that results in a market
cap that is significantly less than the Company s current net cash position. Accordingly, the Company s Board of Directors
has determined that the Company is vulnerable to hostile takeover action and that any such action at this time is not in the best interests
of its stockholders. The Company does not currently have any poison pill type provisions and due to previous reverse stock splits and
other capital markets activities, the Company s management and board members currently own an insignificant number of shares and
as such would be ineffective in voting such shares to thwart any hostile takeover actions. Until such time as the Board determines whether
it is necessary or advisable to adopt a poison pill provision or other anti-takeover measure, on October 31, 2024 the Board determined
to approve the entry into Corporate Action, Change of Control, and Extraordinary Performance Agreements (the Agreement with Rory J. Cutaia, Founder, Chairman and CEO of the Company, and James Geiskopf, Lead Director, (the Awardees pursuant
to which the Company will issue fully vested restricted stock units RSU subject to certain triggering events (the Triggering
Events ), as described below. Each RSU represents the right to be issued one share of common stock (the shares upon vesting, are
subject to the restrictions as set forth in the Agreement, under the Company s 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or the RSU award agreement). 

The
Triggering Events include, among other things, the following: 

1. 
 Acceleration
 Upon a Corporate Transaction or Change of Control 

a.
 Corporate Transaction means any person or Group (as defined in the Agreement) acquires an ownership of Shares (or other
voting securities of the Company then outstanding) of the Company possessing thirteen percent (13 or more of the total voting power
of the Shares (or other voting securities then outstanding) of the Company where such person or Group is required to file a Schedule
13D (Beneficial Ownership Report (for >5 ownership with intent to influence)) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within
10 days of such acquisition. In the event of either a Corporate Transaction or a Change of Control, on or prior to December 31, 2025,
the Awardee shall be entitled to fully vested 80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date (as defined in the Agreement) that
cannot be reached due to the Change of Control. For example, for clarity, if the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control closes on
July 15, 2025, then the Awardee shall be entitled to 160,000 Restricted Stock Units (2 Measurement Dates x 80,000). Such accelerated
Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee and the Company shall grant and deliver the accelerated Restricted Stock
Units Awards to Awardee on or prior to such closing of the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control. 

b.

foregoing restrictions. The Company shall notify the Awardee of any changes in the granting schedule in a timely manner.

grant or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or disposition of the underlying Shares and that the Awardee has been advised to consult
a tax advisor prior to such grant, vesting, or disposition. It is intended that Restricted Stock Units are either exempt from the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code or will satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code so that compensation payable under this Agreement
(and applicable earnings) shall not be included in income under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement,
if the Company determines the Awardee to be one of the Company s specified employees under Section 409A of the Code
at the time of such separation from service in accordance with the identification date specified in the 409A Guidance and the amount
hereunder is deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then any distribution that otherwise would be made to the Awardee
with respect to this Agreement as a result of such separation from service shall not be made until the date that is six months after
such separation from service or, if earlier, the date of the death of the Awardee. However, the Company shall not have any obligation
to take any action to prevent the assessment of any additional tax or penalty on any person for any equity award under Section 409A of
the Code. If this Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and the 409A Guidance, this Agreement will incorporate and satisfy
the written documentation requirement of Section 409A of the Code and the 409A Guidance either directly or by reference to other documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not have any liability to the Awardee for taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the
Code, and the Company shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Awardee for any taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code 

16. GOVERNING
LAW 

The
validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada. 

17. COUNTERPARTS 

This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute
one and the same instrument. 

18. ENTIRE
AGREEMENT 

This
Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Awardee and the Company concerning the subject matter discussed in this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, and representations or warranties, whether written
or oral, by any officer, employee, or representative of the Company. Any prior agreements or understandings that are contrary with respect
to the subject matter set forth in this Agreement are hereby overridden and the terms of this Agreement shall apply.

achievement of each of the applicable Revenue Milestones on each of the Measurement Date will be reasonably determined by the Company s
Board of Directors. 

(b) Distribution
and Vesting Date . Within 10 days after each Measurement Date, the Board of Directors shall reasonably determine if such previous
Revenue Milestone was achieved. If achieved, then based on the level of Revenue Milestone achieved on such Measurement Date, the Board
of Directors shall immediately approve and issue a Restricted Stock Unit Award reflecting the number of Restricted Stock Units the Awardee
has earned on such Measurement Date and such Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be granted and shall immediately vest upon such grant
as follows: 

(i) shall
be granted only at the next available window of opportunity outside of any SEC or Company-imposed blackout period, in compliance with
all applicable securities laws and the Company s trading policies; and 

(ii) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at the time of any Measurement Date, such Awardee is an affiliate as defined
under SEC Rule 144, such that the Awardee is limited by Rule 144 in the number of shares the Awardee may sell in any three-month period,
then the Company shall limit the grant to the maximum amount of Shares otherwise available to the Awardee, so that the number of shares
the Awardee may need to sell to pay the Awardee s income tax liability associated with the grant of such shares, does not exceed
the number of shares the Awardee is permitted to sell in the applicable three-month period. Any shares otherwise available to the Awardee
that were not granted due to the foregoing Rule 144 restrictions as specifically applied to the Awardee, shall be granted to the Awardee
at the next available time in the future when such Awardee is either not an affiliate under Rule 144 or otherwise not subject to the
foregoing restrictions. The Company shall notify the Awardee of any changes in the granting schedule in a timely manner. 

(b) Continuous
Service . Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, provided that the Awardee remains
in Continuous Service (as defined in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement), through the applicable Measurement Dates, the Awardee
shall be entitled to receive the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units as set forth in the vesting schedule.

the Awardee shall be entitled to fully vested 80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date that cannot be reached due to such
termination. For example, for clarity, if the Awardee was terminated either without Cause or the Chief Executive Officer is terminated
by the Company, on or prior to June 15, 2025, then the Awardee shall be entitled to 240,000 Restricted Stock Units (3 Measurement Dates
x 80,000). Such accelerated Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee and the Company shall grant and issue the accelerated
Restricted Stock Units Award to Awardee on or prior to such termination. 

(iii) Acceleration

to December 31, 2025, the Awardee shall be entitled to fully vested 80,000 Restricted Stock Units for each Measurement Date that cannot
be reached due to the Change of Control. For example, for clarity, if the Corporate Transaction or Change of Control closes on July 15,

Such accelerated Restricted Stock Units shall be fully vested to the Awardee (or Awardee s beneficiaries or heirs) and the Company
shall grant and deliver the accelerated Restricted Stock Units Awards to Awardee (or Awardee s beneficiaries or heirs) within 10
days of Awardee s death or Disability.

SECTION 409A 

If
any payments under this Agreement are subject to the provisions of Code Section 409A, it is intended that the Agreement will comply fully
with and meet all the requirements of Code Section 409A. The Awardee acknowledges that there may be adverse tax consequences upon the
grant or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or disposition of the underlying Shares and that the Awardee has been advised to consult
a tax advisor prior to such grant, vesting, or disposition. It is intended that Restricted Stock Units are either exempt from the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code or will satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code so that compensation payable under this Agreement
(and applicable earnings) shall not be included in income under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement,
if the Company determines the Awardee to be one of the Company s specified employees under Section 409A of the Code
at the time of such separation from service in accordance with the identification date specified in the 409A Guidance and the amount
hereunder is deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then any distribution that otherwise would be made to the Awardee
with respect to this Agreement as a result of such separation from service shall not be made until the date that is six months after
such separation from service or, if earlier, the date of the death of the Awardee. However, the Company shall not have any obligation
to take any action to prevent the assessment of any additional tax or penalty on any person for any equity award under Section 409A of
the Code. If this Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and the 409A Guidance, this Agreement will incorporate and satisfy
the written documentation requirement of Section 409A of the Code and the 409A Guidance either directly or by reference to other documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not have any liability to the Awardee for taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the
Code, and the Company shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Awardee for any taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code 

16. GOVERNING
LAW 

The
validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada. 

17. COUNTERPARTS 

This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute
one and the same instrument. 

18. ENTIRE
AGREEMENT 

This
Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Awardee and the Company concerning the subject matter discussed in this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, and representations or warranties, whether written
or oral, by any officer, employee, or representative of the Company. Any prior agreements or understandings that are contrary with respect
to the subject matter set forth in this Agreement are hereby overridden and the terms of this Agreement shall apply. 

IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date set forth above.
