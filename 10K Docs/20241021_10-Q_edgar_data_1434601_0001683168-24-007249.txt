stock issuable upon conversion of the notes is indeterminate. Accordingly, we have recorded the fair value of the embedded conversion
features as a derivative liability at the respective issuance dates of the notes and charged the applicable amounts to debt discounts
and the remainder to other expense. The increase (decrease) in the fair value of the derivative liability from the respective issuance
dates of the notes to the measurement dates is charged (credited) to other expense (income). The fair value of the derivative liability
of the notes is measured at the respective issuance dates and quarterly thereafter using the Black Scholes option pricing model. 

Assumptions used for the calculations
of the derivative liability of the notes at August 31, 2024 include (1) stock price of 0.0001 per share, (2) exercise prices ranging
from 0.00004 to 0.0001 per share, (3) terms ranging from 0 days to 139 days, (4) expected volatility of 461 and (5) risk free interest
rates ranging from 4.89 to 5.41 . 

Assumptions used for the calculations
of the derivative liability of the notes at May 31, 2024 include (1) stock price of 0.0001 per share, (2) exercise prices ranging from

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation 

The following discussion contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relating
to future events or our future performance. Actual results may materially differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements
as a result of certain risks and uncertainties set forth in this prospectus. Although management believes that the assumptions made and
expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, there is no assurance that the underlying assumptions will, in
fact, prove to be correct or that actual results will not be different from expectations expressed in this report. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

The
Marquie Group, Inc. is an emerging direct-to-consumer firm specializing in marketing, product development, and media, including a dynamic
radio and digital network. We craft and promote top-tier health and beauty solutions that enrich lives, showcased through engaging radio
content for our audience. We maintain a website at www.themarquiegroup.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably
practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not a part
of or incorporated by reference into this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. 

We
have two operating segments: (1) Broadcast, and (2) Health and Beauty, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments
reflect how we assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment.
We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as
necessary. 

We
measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that exclude costs related to corporate functions,
such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes,
and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments. 

Broadcasting 

Our
foundational business is radio broadcasting, which includes the ownership and operation of a syndicated radio network including our affiliated
radio stations subscribing to our programming delivery. 

Advertising
revenue generated from our syndicated radio operations is reported as broadcast revenue in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Advertising
revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case revenue is reported net of the commission
retained by the agency. 

Broadcast
revenue is impacted by the rates radio stations can charge for programming and advertising time, the level of airtime sold to programmers
and advertisers, the number of impressions delivered, or downloads made, and the number of listener responses in the case of pay-per-call.
Advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time, which in turn is based on our stations and networks ability
to produce results for their advertisers. We market ourselves to advertisers based on the responsiveness of our audiences. We do not subscribe
to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations. 

Each
of our radio station affiliates allocates 3 minutes per hour of advertising time for our commercials at a preset time every hour based
on the Music of Your Life clock. 

Our
results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As is typical in the broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue
typically exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. Seasonal fluctuations in advertising revenue correspond with quarterly
fluctuations in the retail industry. 

Broadcast
operating expenses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as
lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) production and programming expenses, and (v) music license
fees. In addition to these expenses, our network incurs programming costs and expenses for internet communication facilities. 

16 

Health and Beauty 

Except for AminoMints ,
our health and beauty operations are owned by Simply Whim, Inc., and include Whim , an emerging beauty brand blending Nature, Nutrition,
and Science to offer safe and effective products. Whim s founder, a 3-time cancer survivor under treatment, recognizes the U.S.'s
regulatory lapses and strives for better standards. Exclusively made in the USA, Whim aims to provide responsible beauty options.
We forecast strong sales growth next year, driven by demand for safer beauty solutions, and plan to exceed these expectations with continued
innovation. 

Expenses which comprise the
costs of goods sold will include operational and staffing costs related to product development and product marketing costs. General and
administrative expenses are comprised of administrative wages; office expenses; outside legal, accounting, and other professional fees;
travel and other miscellaneous office and administrative expenses. Selling and marketing expenses include selling/marketing wages and
benefits, advertising, and promotional expenses, as well as travel and other miscellaneous related expenses. 

Because we have incurred losses,
income tax expenses are immaterial. No tax benefits have been booked related to operating loss carryforwards, given our uncertainty of
being able to utilize such loss carryforwards in future years. We anticipate incurring additional losses during the coming year. 

RESULTS OF OPERATION 

Following is management s
discussion of the relevant items affecting results of operations for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Revenues . The Company
generated no net revenues for Broadcasting and Digital Media during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. Revenues in the past
have been generated from spot sales on our syndicated radio network. Revenue for Health and Beauty is expected to be included in the company s
upcoming annual 10-K report for the year ending May 31, 2025. 

Cost of Sales . Our
cost of sales for Broadcasting and Digital Media was -0- for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. Our cost of sales in the
future will consist principally of licensing costs and royalties associated with our syndicated radio network, other related services
provided directly or outsourced through our affiliates, as well as operational and staffing costs with respect thereto. Our Cost of Sales
for Health and Beauty will be included in the company s upcoming annual 10-K report for the year ending May 31, 2025. 

Salaries and Consulting
Expenses . Executive salaries remain unpaid and accruing for the period ended August 31, 2024. Accrued salaries and consulting expenses
were 60,000 and 60,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect that salaries and consulting expenses,
that are cash-based instead of share-based, will increase as we add personnel to build our health and beauty business. 

Professional Fees. 
Professional fees were -0- and 16,976 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Professional fees consist mainly
of the fees related to the audits and reviews of the Company s financial statements as well as the filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. We anticipate that professional fees will increase in future periods as we scale up our operations. 

Other Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses . Other selling, general and administrative expenses were 640 and 567 for the three months ended August
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We anticipate that SG A expenses will increase commensurate with an increase in our operations. 

Other Income (Expenses). 
The Company had net other expenses of 144,304 for the three months ended August 31, 2024. During the three months ended August 31, 2024,
the company recorded expense on the change in the fair value of the derivative liability in the amount of 37,232 and interest expenses
related to notes payable in the amount of 107,072, which included the amortization of debt discounts of 19,900. The Company had net
other income of 430,625 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. During the three months ended August 31, 2023, the company recorded
income on the change in the fair value of the derivative liability in the amount of 543,223 and interest expenses related to notes payable
in the amount of 112,598, which included the amortization of debt discounts of 24,125. 

17 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As of August 31, 2024, our
primary source of liquidity consisted of -0- in cash and cash equivalents. We hold our cash reserves in a major United States bank. Since
inception, we have financed our operations through a combination of short and long-term loans, and through the private placement of our
common stock. 

We have sustained significant
net losses which have resulted in negative working capital and an accumulated deficit at August 31, 2024 of 6,235,552 and 15,068,430,
respectively, which raises doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We generated a net loss for the three months ended
August 31, 2024 of 204,944. Without additional revenues, working capital loans, or equity investment, there is substantial doubt as to
our ability to continue operations. 

We believe these conditions
have resulted from the inherent risks associated with small public companies. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the ability
to (i) generate revenues and sales of our products and services at levels sufficient to cover our costs and provide a return for investors,
(ii) attract additional capital in order to finance growth, and (iii) successfully compete with other comparable companies having financial,
production and marketing resources significantly greater than those of the Company. 

We believe that our capital
resources are insufficient for ongoing operations, with minimal current cash reserves, particularly given the resources necessary to expand
our multi-media entertainment business. We will likely require considerable amounts of financing to make any significant advancement in
our business strategy. There is presently no agreement in place that will guarantee financing for our Company, and we cannot assure you
that we will be able to raise any additional funds, or that such funds will be available on acceptable terms. Funds raised through future
equity financing will likely be substantially dilutive to current shareholders. Lack of additional funds will materially affect our Company
and our business and may cause us to substantially curtail or even cease operations. Consequently, you could incur a loss of your entire
investment in the Company. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Our financial statements and
related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ).
GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact
on the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained
in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk, and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates
and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation
of our financial statements. 

Our significant accounting
policies are summarized in Note 2 of our financial statements included in our May 31, 2024 Form 10-K. While all these significant accounting
policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined
to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater
degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and
circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on
our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. 

We recognize revenue on arrangements
in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605, Revenue Recognition . In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price
is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectability of the resulting
receivable is reasonably assured. 

18 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

We have reviewed accounting
pronouncements issued during the past two years and have adopted any that are applicable to the Company. We have determined that none
had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for the periods presented in this report. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as special purpose
entities SPE s). 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risks 

Not applicable because we
are a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation
of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
as a result of continuing material weaknesses (such as the absence of an audit committee and absence of qualified independent directors)
in its internal control over financial reporting. The disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective because there was no segregation
of duties. One member of our management team handles all accounting duties including the recording of transactions, paying bills, and
reconciling the bank account. We have minimized this risk by having an external accountant review all transactions and make the appropriate
adjustments before the review by our external auditor. 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes
in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the latest fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

19 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

Currently we are not aware
of any litigation pending or threatened by or against the Company. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Not applicable because we
are a smaller reporting company. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

See Note 7 in the notes to
the financial statements. 

With respect to the transactions
in Note 7 to the financial statements, each of the recipients of securities of the Company was an accredited investor or is considered
by the Company to be a sophisticated person , inasmuch as each of them has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of receiving securities of the Company. No solicitation was
made, and no underwriting discounts were given or paid in connection with these transactions. The Company believes that the issuance of
its securities as described above was exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act of 1933. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

The Company has not paid the
principal and interest due on 16 notes payable aggregating 950,701 at August 31, 2024. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not Applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information. 

During
the quarter ended August 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement
