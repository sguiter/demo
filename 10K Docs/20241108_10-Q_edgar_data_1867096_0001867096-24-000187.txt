 commercially available products: Gvoke, a ready-to-use, liquid-stable glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia; Recorlev, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor for the treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adult patients with Cushing's syndrome approved by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in December 2021; and Keveyis, the first therapy approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic, and related variants of Primary Periodic Paralysis ("PPP"). The Company also has a pipeline of development programs to bring new products forward using its proprietary formulation science, XeriSol and XeriJect. 
 As used herein, the "Company" or "Xeris" refers to Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Xeris Pharma") when referring to periods prior to the acquisition of Strongbridge Biopharma plc ("Strongbridge") on October 5, 2021 and to Xeris Biopharma when referring to periods on or subsequent to October 5, 2021. 
 Throughout this document, unless otherwise noted, references to Gvoke include Gvoke PFS, Gvoke HypoPen, Gvoke Kit and Ogluo (glucagon). 
 The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other specialty pharmaceutical companies, including, but not limited to, successful commercialization and market acceptance of available products and any future products, if and when approved, successful development of product candidates, the development of new technological innovations by competitors, ability to acquire additional capital when needed and on acceptable terms, and protection of intellectual property. The Company relies on a number of single source suppliers and manufacturers for the supply of its products and product candidates. Disruptions from these suppliers or manufacturers, which has occurred in the past and could occur in the future, could have a negative impact on the Company s business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the Company is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of political and macroeconomic events and conditions. 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 The Company has incurred operating losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects to continue to incur net losses for at least the next 12 months beyond the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. Based on the Company's current operating plans and existing working capital at September 30, 2024, the Company believes that its cash resources are sufficient to sustain operations and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 If needed, the Company may elect to finance its operations through equity or debt financing along with revenues. There can be no assurance that such funding may be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all, or that the Company will be able to successfully market and sell Gvoke, Recorlev and Keveyis. Market volatility resulting from geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas and the potential for wider conflict in the Middle East, elevated and fluctuating interest rates, inflationary pressures, the tightening of lending standards, any further deterioration in the macroeconomic economy or financial services industry resulting from actual or potential bank failures, uncertainty around the U.S. election or other factors could also adversely impact the Company's ability to access capital as and when needed. The issuance of equity securities may result in dilution to stockholders. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of additional debt, which may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the Company's common stockholders, the terms of the debt could impose significant restrictions on the Company's operations. The failure to raise funds as and when needed could have a negative impact on the Company's financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies. If additional funding is not secured when required, the Company may need to delay or curtail its operations until such funding is received, which would have a material adverse impact on the business prospects and results of operations.

In the second half of 2020, million in principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes were converted into shares of Xeris Pharma's common stock. 
 On September 29, 2023, the Company completed the exchange of million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes for million in aggregate principal amount of new Convertible Notes due 2028 (the "2028 Convertible Notes" and together with the 2025 Convertible Notes, the "Convertible Notes").

 The 2025 Convertible Notes are governed by the terms of a base indenture for senior debt securities dated June 30, 2020 (the "2025 Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated June 30, 2020 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), and the second supplemental indenture dated October 5, 2021 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and together with the 2025 Base Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture, the "2025 Indenture"), among the Company, as guarantor, Xeris Pharma, as issuer, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (f/k/a U.S. Bank National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee").

 million. The fair value of the convertible debt was estimated using inputs for volatility, the Company's stock price, time to maturity, the risk-free rate and the Company's credit spread, some of which are considered Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy disclosed in "Note 11 - Fair value measurement." 
 Loan agreement 
 In September 2019, Xeris Pharma entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the "Oxford Loan Agreement") with Oxford Finance LLC ("Oxford"), as the collateral agent and a lender, and Silicon Valley Bank, as a lender ("SVB," and together with Oxford, the "Prior Lenders"). The Oxford Loan Agreement provided for the Prior Lenders to extend up to million in term loans to Xeris Pharma in tranches, of which million was drawn down in September 2019. 
 In June 2020, Xeris Pharma paid a portion of the term loan equal to the sum of million, plus all accrued and unpaid interest. In November 2020, an additional million was drawn from the term loan. 
 In March 2022, the Company, Xeris Pharma and certain subsidiary guarantors of the Company entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty (as amended, modified or amended and restated from time to time, the "Hayfin Loan Agreement") with the lenders from time to time parties thereto (the "Lenders") and Hayfin Services LLP, as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, together with its successors and assigns, the "Agent"), pursuant to which the Company and its subsidiaries party thereto granted a first priority security interest on substantially all of their assets, including intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions. The Hayfin Loan Agreement provided for the Lenders to extend million in term loans to the Company on the closing date and up to an additional million in delayed draw term loans during the one year period immediately following the closing date (collectively, the "Loans"). On December 28, 2022, the Company borrowed the full amount of such million delayed draw term loan under the Hayfin Loan Agreement. In conjunction with the execution of the Hayfin Loan Agreement, the Oxford Loan Agreement remaining balance of million and fees of million in connection with the loan repayment were paid. In addition to utilizing the proceeds to repay the obligations under the Oxford Loan Agreement in full, the proceeds were otherwise used for general corporate purposes. 
 On March 5, 2024, the Company, Xeris Pharma and certain subsidiary guarantors of the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") with the lenders from time to time parties thereto (the "New Lenders") and Hayfin Services LLP, as administrative agent for the New Lenders, pursuant to which the Company and its subsidiaries party thereto granted a first priority security interest on substantially all of their assets, including intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Hayfin Loan Agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provided for the New Lenders to extend million in term loans (the "Tranche 1 Loans") to Xeris Pharma on the closing date and million in additional term loans (the "Tranche 2 Loans" and, together with the Tranche 1 Loans, the "2029 Loans") on any date after the closing date and through July 15, 2025. The Tranche 2 Loans may only be used to redeem the 2025 Convertible Notes. In conjunction with the execution of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the aggregate principal balance of million plus all accrued and unpaid interest outstanding under the Hayfin Loan Agreement was continued under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as Tranche 1 Loans. In addition to utilizing the proceeds to repay the obligations under the Hayfin Loan Agreement in full, the proceeds of the Tranche 1 Loans will otherwise be used for general corporate purposes. After repayment, the 2029 Loans may not be re-borrowed. 
 The 2029 Loans will mature on March 5, 2029; provided, however, that the 2029 Loans will mature on (A) January 15, 2025 if the 2025 Convertible Notes are outstanding as of such date or (B) January 15, 2028 if the 2028 Convertible Notes are outstanding as of such date and, in both cases, either (i) the maturity date of the applicable notes has not been extended to a date not earlier than September 5, 2029 and (ii) the Company has not received net cash proceeds from one or more permitted equity raises or permitted raises of convertible debt which, together with no more than million of cash on hand, is sufficient to redeem and discharge the 2025 Convertible Notes or the 2028 Convertible Notes, as applicable, in full.

 million CVRs outstanding. Up to million CVRs may be issued to holders of Strongbridge rollover options and assumed warrants upon the exercise thereof. CVRs are settleable in cash, common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock, at the Company's sole election. 
 Contingent consideration obligations are recorded at their estimated fair values and these obligations are revalued at each reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved. The CVRs are adjusted to fair value using the methods described above at the end of each reporting period. Significant changes which increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related milestones or shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of these obligations. 
 The 2023 Keveyis milestone was achieved, triggering a milestone payment to CVR holders. In settlement of the milestone payment obligation, the Company issued shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2024. The 2023 Recorlev Milestone was not achieved. A gain of million from the remeasurement of the CVR liability was recorded in the first quarter of 2024 in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a result of changes in the Company's stock price prior to the issuance of the common stock in settlement of the CVR. 
 The Company has determined that the CVR liabilities' fair values are Level 3 items within the fair value hierarchy.

 incentive stock option and non-qualified stock option awards. 
 The 2018 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2018 Plan") was adopted by the Board of Directors in April 2018 and approved by the Company's stockholders in June 2018 to award up to shares of common stock. The 2018 Plan replaced the 2011 Plan as the Board of Directors decided not to make additional awards under the 2011 Plan following the closing of the IPO, which occurred in June 2018. The 2018 Plan allows the compensation committee to make equity-based and cash-based incentive awards to the Company's officers, employees, directors and other key persons (including consultants). No grants of stock options or other awards may be made under the 2018 Plan after the tenth anniversary of the effective date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were million shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2018 Plan. 
 The 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") was adopted by the Board of Directors in April 2018 and approved by the Company's stockholders in June 2018 to issue up to shares of common stock to participating employees. Through the ESPP, eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to of their compensation to purchase up to the number of shares of common stock determined by dividing by the closing market price of Xeris common stock on the offering date. The purchase price per share at each purchase date is equal to of the lower of (i) the closing market price per share of Xeris common stock on the employee's offering date or (ii) the closing market price per share of Xeris common stock on the purchase date. Each offering period has a six-month duration and purchase interval. As of September 30, 2024, there were million shares available for issuance under the ESPP. 
 The Equity Inducement Plan (the "Inducement Plan") was adopted by the Board of Directors in February 2019. The Inducement Plan allows the Company to make stock option or restricted stock unit awards to prospective employees of the Company as an inducement to such individuals to commence employment with the Company. The Company uses this Inducement Plan to help it attract and retain prospective employees who are necessary to support the commercialization of products and the expansion of the Company generally. As of September 30, 2024, there were million shares of common stock available for future issuance under the Inducement Plan. 
 Assumed Plans 
 On the acquisition date of Strongbridge, the Company assumed all then-outstanding stock options and shares available and reserved for issuance under some legacy equity incentive plans of Strongbridge, including the Strongbridge 2015 equity compensation plan and Strongbridge 2017 inducement plan (collectively, the "Assumed Plans"). Shares reserved under the Assumed Plans will be available for future grants. The Company also assumed all then-outstanding stock options from the rest of the legacy equity incentive plans of Strongbridge without assuming the shares available and reserved for issuance under these plans. The number of shares subject to stock options outstanding under all Strongbridge legacy equity incentive plans are included in the tables below. As of September 30, 2024, there were million shares reserved for future grants under the Assumed Plans.

 after the grant date and expire seven to from the grant date. 
 The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the contractual life of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatilities of a peer group of publicly traded companies as well as the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, since the Company began trading subsequent to the IPO in June 2018, over the period corresponding to the expected life as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of the Company's ordinary shares as of the grant date. 
 Exercised ) Forfeited ) Expired ) Outstanding - September 30, 2024 Vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2024 Exercisable - September 30, 2024 
 At September 30, 2024, there was a total of 0.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 The Company grants Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") to employees. RSUs that are granted vest over either three or in equal annual installments beginning on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, provided that the employee is employed by the Company on such vesting date. If and when the RSUs vest, the Company will issue one share of common stock for each whole RSU that has vested, subject to satisfaction of the employee's tax withholding obligations. Upon vesting and settlement of RSUs or exercise of stock options, at the election of the grantee, the Company does not collect withholding taxes in cash from employees. Instead, the Company withholds upon settlement as RSUs vest, or as stock options are exercised, the portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the minimum statutory withholding taxes due. The withheld shares are accounted for as repurchases of common stock. Stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period.

 Overview 
 Unless otherwise indicated, references to "Xeris," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to Xeris Biopharma Holdings, Inc. Throughout this document, unless otherwise noted, references to Gvoke include Gvoke PFS, Gvoke HypoPen, Gvoke Kit and Ogluo (glucagon) . 
 We are focused on building an innovative, self-sustaining, growth-oriented biopharmaceutical company committed to improving patients' lives by developing and commercializing clinically meaningful products across a range of therapies. We are uniquely positioned to achieve this through our three commercial products and our proprietary formulation science (XeriSol and XeriJect), which generates partnerships and enhances our product candidates. 
 Outlook and strategies 
 Our goal is to build an innovative, self-sustaining, growth-oriented biopharmaceutical company committed to improving patients' lives by developing and commercializing clinically meaningful products across a range of therapies. To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following strategies: 
 Table of Contents 

 Gvoke is a ready-to-use, liquid-stable glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. The product is indicated for use in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes age 2 years and above and can be administered in 2 simple steps. The estimated total addressable market for this drug is approximately 5.0 billion in the United States. 
 Recorlev is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor approved for the treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adult patients with Cushing's syndrome for whom surgery is not an option or has not been curative. Endogenous Cushing's syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal endocrine disease caused by chronic elevated cortisol exposure. The estimated total addressable market for this therapy is approximately 3.0 billion in the United States. 
 Keveyis is the first therapy approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic, and related variants of Primary Periodic Paralysis ("PPP"). PPP is a rare genetic, neuromuscular disorder that can cause extreme muscle weakness and/or paralysis; some forms are also commonly associated with myotonia or muscle stiffness. The estimated total addressable market for this therapy is greater than 0.5 billion in the United States. 
 Our proprietary formulation capabilities 
 Our company name, Xeris, is derived from the ancient Greek word x r s meaning 'dry' or 'without water/non-aqueous'. Our proprietary, non-aqueous formulation capabilities are designed to enable the convenient injection of medicines previously uninjectable or poorly injectable when utilizing aqueous approaches. Both XeriSol and XeriJect offer the opportunity to create ready-to-use, room-temperature stable, highly concentrated, injectable formulations of both small and large molecules. These proprietary formulation capabilities can enable subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) administration in lieu of intravenous (IV) infusion, allow for convenient, cost-effective storage, and provide an improved patient, caregiver, and healthcare provider experience. XeriSol and XeriJect have broad applications and enable us to develop our own internal product development candidates in endocrinology, neurology and other therapeutic areas. They also enable us to pursue formulation and development partnerships pursuant to which our proprietary formulation science is applied with the goal of enhancing the product formulation, delivery and clinical profile of other companies' proprietary drugs and biologics. 
 Development of product candidates 
 Once Weekly Subcutaneous Injection of Levothyroxine (XP-8121) 
 XP-8121 is a novel formulation for subcutaneous administration that could potentially mitigate many of the challenges associated with oral formulations, such as identification of an ideal dose due to absorption variation and medication adherence for patients who have difficulty maintaining a stable, therapeutic serum level. Preclinical studies of XP-8121 showed a sustained plasma exposure profile and similar highest concentration of a drug in the blood, ("Cmax"), when compared with equivalent doses of the oral formulation. We conducted a Phase 1 study of XP-8121 to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, and potential for weekly dosing in the treatment of hypothyroidism. 
 Levothyroxine and Hypothyroidism 
 The thyroid gland is responsible for the synthesis, storage, and release of metabolic hormones including thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are crucial in the regulation of critical metabolic processes and are vital for normal growth and development during fetal life, infancy, and childhood. 
 Therapeutically, levothyroxine is administered as a replacement for deficient thyroid hormones. The goal of the therapy is restoration of the euthyroid state which can reverse the clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism and significantly improve quality of life. The treatment of choice for correction of hypothyroidism is currently continuous daily oral administration of levothyroxine. It is one of the most widely prescribed drug products in the United States, but the complexity of maintaining biochemical and clinical euthyroidism in patients undergoing treatment with oral levothyroxine is challenging. It has been reported that nearly 40 of patients undergoing treatment with oral levothyroxine are either over- or under-treated due to factors that include, but are not limited to, drug formulation, use of the drug with food, adherence to the drug, use of concomitant medications, and pre-existing medical conditions. Many patients failing to reach target thyroid stimulating hormone ("TSH") levels are managed by simply increasing their levothyroxine daily dose. However, levothyroxine is a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that relatively small deviations from the proper dose can cause a clinically meaningful shift in pharmacological effects when administered to a patient; thus, the titration of levothyroxine oral drug may be a tailored and incremental process. 
 The Phase 1 clinical study was a single ascending dose crossover design in 30 healthy participants to compare matching doses of oral levothyroxine (Synthroid) and subcutaneous XP-8121. The primary endpoints of the study were to characterize the absorption and elimination kinetics of XP-8121 and compare bioavailability of XP-8121 to oral levothyroxine. Secondary endpoints were safety and tolerability of XP-8121. 
 In October 2022, we reported positive topline Phase 1 data of XP-8121. The data showed that subjects receiving XP-8121 subcutaneous had slower absorption, lower peak plasma, and higher extended exposure compared to Synthroid PO at the comparable dose of 600 g. In addition, exposure was proportional over the range of ascending XP-8121 doses studied. Simulations based on a population pharmacokinetic model indicated that exposure from weekly XP-8121 1200 g SC doses overlapped daily Synthroid PO 300 g suggesting a dose conversion factor of 4x. Importantly, single SC doses of XP-8121 at all doses were generally well-tolerated and the XP-8121 doses studied were generally comparable to Synthroid 600 g PO with respect to the safety findings. In June 2023, we initiated a non-randomized, open-label, single arm, self-controlled Phase 2 study to determine a target dose conversion factor from

 stably dosed oral levothyroxine to XP-8121 in patients with hypothyroidism and also assess the safety and tolerability after once-weekly subcutaneous injections. The data established an average once-weekly SC dose of XP-8121 and confirmed our previous Phase 1 study of a four-time target dose conversion factor when switching from once-daily oral administration of levothyroxine. Participants who completed the study rated higher treatment satisfaction with XP-8121 compared to oral levothyroxine and a majority (72 indicated a strong preference for the subcutaneous route of administration. An FDA End-of-Phase 2 interaction to facilitate a Phase 3 pivotal study program is expected by year-end. 
 Patents 
 We currently own 179 patents issued globally, including composition of matter patents covering our ready-to-use glucagon formulation that expire in 2036. Included in the total patents, we have 64 granted patents globally related to our platform technologies and 8 patents granted in the United States and listed in the United States FDA Orange Book covering proprietary formulations of levoketoconazole (the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Recorlev) and the uses of such formulations in treating certain endocrine-related diseases and syndromes. The latter includes United States Patent Nos. 11,020,393, 11,278,547 and 11,903,940, which were granted on June 1, 2021, March 22, 2022, and February 20, 2024, respectively, and which provide patent protection through 2040 for the use of Recorlev in the treatment of certain patients with persistent or recurrent Cushing's syndrome. 
 Financing 
 We have funded our operations to date primarily with proceeds from the sale of our preferred and common stock and debt financing. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we reported net losses of 49.7 million and 48.9 million, respectively. We have not been profitable since inception, and, as of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 666.7 million. In the near term, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses, operating losses and net losses as we, among other things:

 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 7.7 million or 20.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the CEO succession plan and restructuring 6.1 million) and higher expenses for Recorlev expansion 3.7 million), partially offset by lower external spending 2.1 million). 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 14.8 million or 13.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the CEO succession plan and restructuring 6.1 million), higher expenses for Recorlev expansion 10.7 million), and higher rent 1.0 million), partially offset by lower external spending 3.0 million). 
 Amortization of intangible assets 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, amortization of intangible assets were both 2.7 million and 8.1 million, respectively. 
 Other income (expense)

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 0.9 million or 13.7 and 3.2 million or 16.3 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases in both periods were primarily due to a higher principal amount and increased interest rates. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, change in fair value of contingent value rights was a gain of 0.4 million and 4.4 million, respectively, compared to 0.9 million and 3.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The gains were primarily due to the remeasurement of the CVR liability as a result of changes in our stock price prior to issuance of the common stock issued in settlement of the CVR in the first quarter 2024 and the revaluation of the CVR liability related to the Recorlev 2024 sales milestone. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, deferred refinancing costs were 2.7 million related to the third party debt arrangements for advisory and legal fees. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary uses of cash are to fund costs related to the manufacturing, marketing and selling of products, the research and development of our product candidates, general and administrative expenses and working capital requirements. Historically, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock, public equity offerings of common stock, and the issuance of debt. 
 On January 2, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement in connection with the private placement of our common stock with Armistice for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 30.0 million and completed the transaction on January 3, 2022. In January 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective on February 7, 2022, and which covers the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to an aggregate of 250.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units. 
 In March 2022, we, Xeris Pharma and certain subsidiary guarantors, entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the "Hayfin Loan Agreement") with the lenders from time to time parties thereto (the "Lenders") and Hayfin Services LLP, as administrative agent for the Lenders, pursuant to which we and our subsidiaries party thereto granted a first priority security interest on substantially all of our assets, including intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions. The Hayfin Loan Agreement provided for the Lenders to extend 100.0 million in term loans to us on the closing date and up to an additional 50.0 million in delayed draw term loan(s) during the one year period immediately following the closing date (collectively, the "Loans"). On December 28, 2022, we borrowed the full amount of such 50.0 million delayed draw term loan under the Hayfin Loan Agreement. In conjunction with the execution of the Hayfin Loan Agreement, the Oxford Loan Agreement balance of 43.5 million was repaid in full and fees of 2.1 million in connection with the loan repayment were paid. In addition to utilizing the proceeds to repay the obligations under the Oxford Loan Agreement in full, the proceeds were otherwise used for general corporate purposes. After repayment, the Loans may not be re-borrowed. 
 In September 2023, we completed the exchange of 32.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes for 33.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the 2025 Convertible Notes was 15.2 million and the outstanding balance of the 2028 Convertible Notes was 33.6 million. 
 In March 2024, we, Xeris Pharma and certain subsidiary guarantors, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") with the lenders from time to time parties thereto (the "New Lenders") and Hayfin Services LLP, as administrative agent for the New Lenders, pursuant to which the Company and its subsidiaries party thereto granted a first priority security interest on substantially all of their assets, including intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated the Hayfin Loan Agreement in its entirety. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provided for the New Lenders to extend 200.0 million in term loans to the Company on the closing date and up to an additional 15.2 million in additional term loans, which additional term loans are available only to redeem the Company's existing 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 Capital Resources and Funding Requirements 
 We have incurred operating losses since inception, and we have an accumulated deficit of 666.7 million at September 30, 2024. Based on our current operating plans and existing working capital at September 30, 2024, we believe that our cash resources are sufficient to sustain operations and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We expect to incur substantial additional expenditures in the near term to support the marketing and selling of Gvoke, Recorlev and Keveyis as well as our ongoing research and development activities. We expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to fund the marketing and selling of Gvoke, Recorlev and Keveyis, as well as our product development and clinical operations, including

 completion of future clinical trials, will depend on the amount and timing of cash received from product revenue and potential future financings. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business, principally risk associated with interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents restricted cash and Investments We are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. A hypothetical one-percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments outstanding at September 30, 2024 would increase or decrease interest income by approximately 0.7 million on an annual basis. 
 Long-term Debt Our interest rate risk relates primarily to the United States dollar SOFR-indexed borrowings. Based on our outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, interest is incurred at a floating per annum rate in an amount equal to the sum of (i) 6.95 (or 5.95 if the replacement rate is in effect) plus (ii) the greater of (x) the forward-looking term rate based on SOFR for a three month tenor (or the replacement rate, if applicable), and (y) 2.00 per annum. The remaining balance of unamortized debt issuance costs have been reflected as a direct reduction to the loan balance. Interest on the 2025 Convertible Notes is assessed at a fixed rate of 5.0 annually and interest on the 2028 Convertible Notes is assessed at a fixed rate of 8.0 annually and therefore do not subject us to interest rate risk. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 We contract with research organizations outside the United States at times. We may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with certain of these agreements. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (principal executive officer) and chief financial officer (principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). Based on such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its chief executive and chief financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, as of the date of this report, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial statements, results of operations, and cash flows. Additional risks not currently known, or risks that are currently believed to be not material, may also impair business operations. The material changes to our risk factors since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, are presented below. 
 Risks Related to Third-Parties Actions and Market Acceptance 
 Our reliance on third-party suppliers, including single-source suppliers, together with a limited number of possible suppliers and long development lead times to establish alternative sources for our products, product candidates, components and other key materials has in the past and may in the future impact our ability to develop our product candidates or to continue to commercialize Gvoke, Recorlev, Keveyis, or any product candidates that are approved. 
 We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for the production of Gvoke, Recorlev, or Keveyis for commercial supply or our product candidates for use in clinical trials. We rely on third-party suppliers to manufacture and supply our products and our product candidates. For Gvoke, we currently rely on a number of single-source suppliers, such as Bachem Americas, Inc. and certain of its affiliates ("Bachem") for active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API"), Pyramid Laboratories Inc. ("Pyramid") for drug product, and SHL Pharma, LLC ("SHL Pharma") for auto-injector and final product assembly, and we have entered into several supply agreements including with Bachem, Pyramid and SHL Pharma. 
 Taro produces all of our requirements for Keveyis pursuant to a supply agreement. If the agreement were to be terminated by Taro prior to the next renewal in March of 2027, we will need to find a new third party to manufacture Keveyis or manufacture the product ourselves. Similarly, for Recorlev, we rely on a number of single-source suppliers, such as Regis Technologies, Inc. for API and Xcelience, LLC ("Lonza") for finished drug product. In addition, we rely on other third parties to manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical trials. If any of these vendors are unable or unwilling to meet our future requirements, we may not be able to manufacture and/or supply our products in a timely manner. 
 Although we often have contracts with our third-party suppliers, our current arrangements with these manufacturers are terminable by such manufacturers, subject to certain notice provisions. In addition, Taro maintains certain reversion rights in the purchased assets, including the regulatory approval for Keveyis, enabling Taro to elect to have the purchased assets returned to it and to terminate its agreement with us should we be materially in non-compliance with any reversion condition such as breaching certain of the assignment restrictions or failing to meet our marketing commitments after receiving notice thereof and failing to cure such material non-compliance. In the event one of our third-party suppliers breaches, terminates or refuses to renew their agreement with us or otherwise refuses to supply us with product, product candidates, components or other key materials, we may be unable to find an adequate alternative vendor, or an affordable alternative or other acceptable solution in time and our product development and commercial activities could be harmed. 
 Our third-party suppliers may not be required to provide us with any guaranteed minimum production levels or have dedicated capacity for our products. As a result, we may not obtain sufficient quantities of products, product candidates, components or other key materials in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole. In addition, even if we have agreed with our third-party suppliers to receive certain quantities of products, product candidates, components or other key materials, our third-party suppliers have in the past and may in the future not produce sufficient inventory to meet commercial demand in a timely manner, or at all. We continue to experience long lead times for certain components and materials used in the production of our products and product candidates. In addition, we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delays or supply constraints due to manufacturing defects by our third-party suppliers, a lack of raw materials supply and other risks that we have limited ability to prevent. A supply shortage or longer lead times for delivery than expected in the supply of products, product candidates, components or other key materials supplied to us by our third-party suppliers has in the past and could in the future impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products. Growth in the costs and expenses of raw materials may also impair our ability to cost effectively manufacture our products. 
 Any disruption to the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers resulting from weather-related events, epidemics, global health concerns, fire, acts of terrorism, political instability, war, labor or geopolitical issues, or any other cause could materially impair our ability to manufacture our products and to distribute our products to customers. We have a global supply chain and manufacture some components of our products outside the United States, including without limitation, in Taiwan and Israel. The current war between Israel and Hamas has in the past and could in the future directly and indirectly affect our operations. For example, the Israel-Hamas war could result in damage, destruction or disruptions to the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers, including, but not limited to, our supplier of Keveyis, longer lead times for our products or product candidates, export delays or restrictions or other adverse events which adverse events we cannot predict with any certainty. Any interruption or other delay in the production or delivery of our supplies could reduce sales of our products and increase our costs and any negative impact of such matters on our third-party suppliers and manufacturers may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, further attacks by Hamas, Hezbollah or other groups on Israel could further impact our third-party supplier's operations in 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 Israel. Furthermore, a widening of the conflict in the Middle East or further escalation could lead to broader geopolitical destabilization and macro-economic impacts. 
 Gvoke and some of our product candidates are drug-device combination products that are regulated under the drug regulations of the Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") based on their primary mode of action as a drug. Third-party manufacturers may fail to comply with the current Good Manufacturing Practice ("CGMP") regulatory requirements applicable to drug-device combination products, including applicable provisions of the FDA s drug CGMP regulations, device CGMP requirements embodied in the Quality System Regulation (the "QSR") or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of our products and product candidates, re-labeling or re-packaging of our products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly affect the supply of our products and product candidates. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and product candidates must be registered with the FDA and are subject to inspections conducted by the FDA to ensure compliance with CGMPs. Other foreign regulatory authorities may also require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with CGMPs and the QSR. Contract manufacturers have in the past and may in the future face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance or device component production and shipment delays, supply shortages or circumstances where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable CGMP or the QSR. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications, CGMP and/or the QSR and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or such foreign regulatory authorities do not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products or product candidates or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to market our products or develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. 
 Further, as part of their manufacture of our products, product candidates, components and other key materials, our third-party suppliers are expected to comply with and respect the rights of others. From time to time, our third-party suppliers have in the past and may in the future not properly maintain or defend intellectual property rights that they license to us or act in such a way as to invite complaints and litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or other rights or expose us to potential litigation. If a third-party supplier has failed or fails to maintain or acquire the proper licenses, otherwise infringes the proprietary rights of others or otherwise breaches an agreement with any of their partners in the course of providing services to us, we may have to find alternative third-party suppliers or defend against litigation claims, either of which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain or maintain regulatory approval for or commercialize our products and our product candidates, if approved. There are a limited number of third-party suppliers that are compliant with CGMP and/or the QSR, as required by the FDA, the EU, and other regulatory authorities, and that also have the necessary expertise and capacity to manufacture our materials and products. As a result, it may be difficult for us to locate third-party suppliers for our anticipated future needs, and our anticipated growth could strain the ability of our current third-party suppliers to deliver products, raw materials, and components to us. In addition, there is typically a transition period when a new third-party supplier commences work. Legislative proposals are pending that, if enacted, could negatively impact U.S. funding for certain biotechnology providers, including some of our vendors, that have relationships with certain foreign governments or which pose a threat to national security. The potential downstream adverse impacts on entities having only commercial relationships with any impacted biotechnology providers is unknown but may include supply chain disruptions or delays. If we are unable to arrange for third-party suppliers for our materials and products, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of or market our products. 
 The introduction of new CGMP or QSR regulations or product specific requirements by a regulatory body may require that we source alternative materials, modify existing manufacturing processes, or implement design changes to our products that are subject to prior approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. We may also be required to reassess a third-party supplier s compliance with all applicable new regulations and guidelines, which could further impede our ability to manufacture and supply products in a timely manner. As a result, we could incur increased production costs, experience supply interruptions, suffer damage to our reputation and experience an adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, on January 31, 2024, the FDA issued a final rule which will be effective in 2026 to amend its Quality System Regulation QSR requirements to align more closely with the international consensus standards for medical devices. Specifically, the FDA amended the requirements primarily by incorporating by reference the 2016 edition of the International Organization of Standardization ISO ), ISO 13485 standard. While the ISO 13485 standard and the FDA s QSR requirements are similar in certain aspects, we are evaluating whether we need to revise our compliance system and processes to be in line with the final rule. In addition, our reliance on third-party suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including, among other things:

 Table of Contents 

 unfavorable interpretation of contract terms and/or result in the inability for us to commercialize one or more of our products or manufacture one or more of our product candidates, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, many of the rights we have received related to our products or product candidates were received from parties who in turn received those rights from other parties to which we are not in privity of contract. Our counterparties have in the past and may in the future be subject to disputes that they have breached the terms of the agreements from which our rights are derived but to which we are not a party or act in such a way as to invite complaints and litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or other rights or expose us to potential litigation. If one of our partners breached an agreement with any of their partners in the course of providing services or rights to us, we may have to defend against litigation claims, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain or maintain regulatory approval for or commercialize our products and our product candidates, if approved.
