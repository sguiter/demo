Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The Company s accounting policies are more fully
described in Note 2 of the audited financial statements in our recently filed Form 10-K. As discussed in Note 2, the preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions about the future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
the accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual differences could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company believes that the following addresses the Company s most critical accounting policies. 

We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, which
establishes a five-step analysis to be followed when determining the recognition of revenue. While the Company is an early-stage company
with no revenue, at the time we begin to generate revenue the Company will recognize such revenue in conformity with the guidelines set
forth by ASC 606. 

Our policy for our allowance for doubtful accounts
will be maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments. If there is deterioration
of our customers credit worthiness and/or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater
than the historical assumptions used, additional allowances may be required. 

We account for income taxes in accordance with the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and SAB 118. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

NU-MED PLUS, INC., a Utah corporation NU-MED 
or the Company was incorporated in October 2011 in the state of Utah to develop, manufacture and market new technologies
utilizing nitric oxide in the medical device 

14 

field, primarily through the creation of a nitric
oxide generating compound formulation and delivery systems. To date we have developed a hospital nitric oxide delivery system, a clinical
nitric oxide delivery system, a mobile rechargeable device to deliver nitric oxide gas, and a nitric oxide system that can be used for
research applications. NU-MED is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. 

On May 15, 2023, Nu-Med Plus,
Inc. entered into a non-binding letter of intent with YourSpace America, Inc. YSA ), a Delaware corporation, for the merger
of YSA into Nu-Med, subject to due diligence. Pursuant to the LOI, the Parties will enter into an agreement and plan of merger which will
be mutually negotiated and drafted by the Parties. The Company (as the surviving entity) will assume all liabilities of YSA (as the merging
entity) including any liabilities arising from, or in connection with, any contracts assigned by YSA to the Company as part of the Transaction. 

On April 25, 2024, Nu-Med
Plus, Inc. (the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement for the merger
of YourSpace America, Inc. YSA into the Company (the Transaction ). The Company and YSA may be referred to
herein each as a Party and, collectively, as the Parties. While the terms have been set, the agreed-upon transaction
will not be closed until the completion of the YSA audit for the year ended December 31, 2023. On August 12, 2024, the Shae Exchange Agreement
was amended to provide that the closing would take place upon the completion of the audit of the YSA financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2023. 

On October 28, 2024 the Company received notice from YSA that they were
terminating the Share Exchange Agreement. Accompanying their notice was a letter of resignation from Mr. Colvin, resigning his position
as President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director effective immediately. The Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignation
and appointed Mr. Hayde to the office of President and Chief Executive Officer. The Company filed a Form 8-K disclosing the termination
of the Share Exchange Agreement and the change in executive officers on October 30, 2024. 

Business 

The mission of NU-MED is to design, develop, and market
technologies in the medical device field. Our technologies will focus on market niches in high growth trend areas. We hope each developed
technology will fill a current need in medical procedures by improving upon an existing technology or device, or by designing a device
to serve a need that is clearly defined and acknowledged by medical professionals. 

NU-MED is a medical device company principally engaged
in the design, innovation, development, enhancement and commercialization of beginning, early, and selective later-stage quality medical
devices. The mission of NU-MED is to design, develop, and market technologies utilizing nitric oxide in the medical device field. Our
technologies focus on market niches in high growth trend areas. Our products are developed to target a current need in medical procedures
by improving upon an existing technology or device or by designing a device to serve a currently unfilled need that is clearly defined
and acknowledged by medical professionals. Our focus has been on the creation of a nitric oxide generating formulation, a hospital bedside
nitric oxide delivery system, a clinical unit for use in medical clinics and rehabilitation centers and a mobile device to deliver nitric
oxide gas to offer new and innovative solutions to hospitals, health systems and the medical community throughout the world. 

Development of our products has been suspended until
such time as a capital infusion is received which will enable the funding of further development. The following is a description of the
medical application for the products that have been under development and the status of each of those products: 

Nitric oxide is an extremely important bio-mediator
in the human body that is produced from the amino acid l-arginine. Nitric oxide has anti-inflammatory properties, antibacterial, antiviral
and antifungal properties which make it useful in certain medical treatments. At the present time inhaled nitric oxide (INO is
used as a selective 

15 

vasodilator in infants. The only FDA approved use
of nitric oxide at this time is for the treatment of Hypoxia in premature infants and newborn babies. Management is not aware of any other
potential uses of nitric oxide that have been cleared by the FDA, but this may change as new submittals are made. The heavy cost of delivering
nitric oxide to patients has created limitations in its use. Discoveries that have been made since the first FDA approved use of nitric
0oxide in 1999 have led to a number of new potential uses, which still need FDA approval, in a wide variety of diseases and health complications,
including COPD, flu viruses, bacterial infections, tuberculosis, non-healing wounds, head injuries and much more. NU-MED hopes to take
advantage of the expanding medical uses of nitric oxide by developing a new method to generate nitric oxide that reduces the delivery
costs and can be used in a variety of medical and research settings. Given NU-MED s size, we do not anticipate being involved in
any clinical studies on new uses of nitric oxide and will rely on other parties to continue to advance the uses of nitric oxide. 

NU-MED PLUS has focused on the development of five
distinct products for the delivery of nitric oxide. NU-MED products have not been fully developed; therefore we have not made any submission
for FDA approval under any medical use. 

1. Nitric oxide proprietary formulation. Generates nitric oxide gas on demand,
eliminating the need for 

 Com0pressed gas cylinders. 

2. A hospital delivery device
with controls and safety monitors built in that delivers inhaled nitric oxide to a patient at therapeutic levels. This delivery system
is intended for hospitals specifically intensive care units. The goal is to have a system that delivers a metered therapeutic dose (up
to 40 ppm) of nitric oxide via a ventilator. The core technology allows dilution of nitric oxide to therapeutic levels to be accomplished
without the use of injectors or valves. Safeguards such as concentration monitoring, flow and gas purity would be standard. 

3. A clinical delivery unit that
is designed for treatment in an office or physician s clinic. A unit powered by a wall outlet, administration of the nitric oxide
would be via cannula or non-rebreather face mask 

4. A compact, mobile/portable
rechargeable device to deliver inhaled nitric oxide gas. The portable system necessitates a design which can be deployed where a reliable
source of power is not available or is difficult to access. The key feature is a rechargeable battery pack that powers the unit for the
full duration of a therapeutic session. It can be recharged using existing electrical sources, a solar array or other alternative energy
source. The unit is designed as a low power but fully functional nitric oxide delivery system for inhalation therapy, that can be used
as a transport device during the movement of a patient or as a delivery device in those remote areas of the world that do not currently
have electrical power readily available. 

5. A disposable unit that will
deliver a therapeutic dose of nitric oxide to a patient and will then be placed into a container to be incinerated. This unit would be
used for the treatment of patients in a pandemic, where a large number of patients must be treated and there is insufficient capacity
to sterilize the unit after use by each patient. The dispensing devices would be isolated and destroyed after use to ensure that another
patient is not exposed to the bacteria or virus carried by the patient originally treated. 

6. A unit that is one of the
world s first nitric oxide dilution systems designed for research. A patent pending technology utilizes pure 100 nitric oxide from
a pressurized tank source and dilutes it with air or other non-reactive diluent gas to provide a 1 to 500 ppm source of high purity nitric
oxide for investigational applications. 

The principal gas we aim to generate through each
of our systems described above is medical grade nitric oxide, along with other various combinations of beneficial medical gases. Non-medical
grade nitric oxide gas is produced and sold commercially by major gas companies as a specialty gas mixture and calibration gas. Nitrogen
dioxide is present in all nitric oxide gas currently produced. Its presence limits the size of the dose of nitric oxide gas that
can be administered for prospective uses in both humans and animals. 

16 

A longer-term goal is to further develop our proprietary
compound formulation option that will be utilized to produce medical grade nitric oxide for use in all delivery units. Management
believes that with the further refinement of our formulation, we can make and filter medical grade nitric oxide gas with minimal amounts
of nitrogen dioxide, and that this process can produce medical grade nitric oxide gas in ample quantities for any current or prospective
use and hopefully at a price less than that of all currently available technologies. For a number of years the only approved and
available medical grade nitric oxide delivery device was a product named Inomax. Since this is a single source market there is no price
competition and price is set at a "market can bear" level. We believe, given this structure, there is ample room for a competitive
response from NU-MED using on site generated nitric oxide at a lower cost to penetrate the market. The cost of materials and labor for
the NU-MED product is anticipated to be low, while still providing attractive margins. Our product must have a known shelf life and
be available in various configurations to yield known concentrations and volumes of gas. Packaging is a critical developmental process
that we will address after completion of our formulation. 

We approximate that the sale of our research unit
for non-clinical laboratory work could take place earlier than FDA approval. Management anticipates that selling our units earlier into
the market as laboratory equipment or to international groups will pave the way for sales of our medical delivery devices, but any financial
contributions from intellectual property licenses and sales and other non-medical sales will not be adequate to fund the substantial costs
of the FDA approval process for human medical uses. Even with sales to laboratories or other uses, we will require additional funding,
which we currently do not have in place and have no assurance that we will be able to obtain, or to obtain at acceptable rates. 

All human medical uses of nitric oxide gas require
FDA approval prior to initiating sales in the United States and the approval of similar international agencies in their respective countries.
 Approval can be a long and expensive process, with no assurance that any such approval can or will be obtained. Our products from
the compound formulation for nitric oxide to our delivery machines will have to be approved by the FDA prior to any sales for human use.
Although the FDA can approve uses for nitric oxide and such uses can be expanded, our products, both the formulations and
equipment, would also have to be approved to be used in association with the treatment using nitric oxide. Accordingly, although the use
of nitric oxide for the treatment of hypoxia in newborns is approved by the FDA, we still would need to have our dispensing unit and compound
approved by the FDA for such treatment. In order for our dispensing unit to be used we would not have to prove the efficacy of the treatment
but only that our product and compounds are substantially equivalent to those already approved by the FDA. Even this level
of approval requires time, carries substantial costs, and creates additional uncertainty as to our ability to bring a product to the marketplace.
We currently do not have the funds to seek such an approval. We are currently wor0king to secure funding that will enable us to submit
the hospital unit for FDA approval. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At September 30, 2024, we had assets of 6,841 with
current assets of 6,841 and liabilities of 211,382. Our current assets consisted primarily of 4,041 in cash and prepaid expenses in
the amount of 2,800. Our working capital deficiency at September 30, 2024 was 204,541. We currently have no revenue and have had to
rely on loans from shareholders or sale of our stock to cover expenses. Without additional capital, we will not be able to stay in business
and move our business plan forward. We anticipate, based on our preliminary budgets, that we will need 300,000 in additional financing
for the next twelve months to cover our corporate overhead and need an additional 900,000 to cover ongoing product development. Since
we will not have a commercial product in the next twelve months, we will have to continue to rely on outside funding to support our operations
and product development and testing efforts. Given the financial state of NU-MED, we will not be able to seek traditional bank financing
and have to rely on private stock sales as well as potential loans from investors and shareholders. We cannot estimate the full costs
to bring our proposed product to market or the timing of such commercialization. Given the nature of our product being in the medical
field, testing is very expensive and we would need more capital prior to the completion of the testing phase. Any refinement or modification
of the product after the prototype is 

17 

developed would also require additional capital. At
this time, we will have to continue to rely on outside capital and a budget that may require adjustment as we move further in the product
development phase. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and
2023 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we had no revenues and operating expenses of 17,417 and 15,146, respectively. The increase in operating expenses results primarily
from increases in professional fees of 4,950 and filing fees of 2,188, offset by a decrease in investor relations fees of 3,298 and
rent expense of 3,300. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 we recognized interest expense of 1,260. We had a net loss
of 18,677 in 2024, compared to a net loss of 16,406 in 2023. We do not anticipate any revenue for the foreseeable future as our products
are still in the development stage. 

Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and
2023 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
we had no revenues and operating expenses of 54,037 and 65,190, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses results primarily from
a decrease in legal fees of 4,200 and rent expense of 9,600. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 we recognized interest
expense of 3,753. We had a net loss of 57,790 in 2024, compared to a net loss of 68,930 in 2023. We do not anticipate any revenue for
the foreseeable future as our products are still in the development stage 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and it is
not anticipated that the Company will enter into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Forward-looking Statements 

 Our Company and our representatives may from time
to time make written or oral statements that are forward-looking, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report
and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our Company s stockholders. Management believes
that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters, as well as from developments beyond our
Company s control including changes in global economic conditions are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act.
These statements are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding
future events and business performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management s expectations will necessarily come
to pass. Factors that may affect forward-looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments
and performance, including the following: 

Changes in Company-wide strategies, which may result
in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our Company is involved or chooses to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional
economic conditions, changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including significant interest rate fluctuations, which
may impede our Company s access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for our operations and investments; increased competitive
pressures, both domestically and internationally, legal and regulatory developments, such as regulatory actions affecting environmental
activities, the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse
weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption
of operations. 

This list of factors that may affect future performance
and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements
should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15c or 15d-15e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our management does not expect
that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

Based on that evaluation,
as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 

There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal
control over financial reporting.
