Interim Results The unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). These rules and regulations permit some of the information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to be condensed or omitted. In management s opinion, the unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial position of the Company for the interim periods presented. The Company reports operating results and financial data in operating segment and reporting unit. Operating results for the three-month and the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Contract receivables, net 

The Company sells certain billed contract receivables in accordance with its Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (the MRPA with MUFG Bank, Ltd. MUFG ). The contract receivables that are sold without recourse and where the Company does not retain any ongoing financial interest in the transferred receivables, other than providing servicing activities, are accounted for as sales under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing ASC 860 ). Consequently, these contract receivables are derecognized from the Company s consolidated balance sheets at the date of the sale, and the cash received from MUFG is presented as part of cash flows from operating activities.

The aggregate impact of the sale of billed contract receivables on the Company s operating cash flows was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company also sold certain billed contract receivables to MUFG that did not qualify as sales under ASC 860. Consequently, the cash received from and remitted back to MUFG is presented as cash from financing activities within Proceeds from other short-term borrowings and Repayments of other short-term borrowings on the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amounts due to MUFG for cash collected and not yet remitted for billed contract receivables sold that did not qualify as sales under ASC 860 totaled million and million , respectively. These amounts are included as part of Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets.

Net contract assets (liabilities)

Effective tax rate 

The prior year tax adjustments, uncertain tax position and tax credits recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are both primarily related to the Research Experimentation R E credits. 
 The Company s effective income tax rate was higher for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to restructuring of the ownership of the Company s Canadian entities and the deduction for worthless stock related to the wind-down of the Company s commercial marketing business in the United Kingdom (the U.K. during the second and the third quarters of 2023, respectively, which reduced the Company s 2023 effective tax rate.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, should, will, would, or similar words. You should read statements that contain these words carefully. The risk factors described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), as well as any cautionary language in this Quarterly Report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties, and events that may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: 
 Our dependence on contracts with United States U.S. federal, state and local, and international governments, agencies, and departments for the majority of our revenue; 

Changes in federal government budgeting and spending priorities; 

Failure by Congress or other governmental bodies to approve budgets and debt ceiling increases in a timely fashion and related reductions in government spending; 

Uncertainties relating to the outcomes of the U.S. presidential election in November 2024; 

Failure of the presidential administration and Congress to agree on spending priorities, which may result in temporary shutdowns of non-essential federal functions, including our work to support such functions; 

Results of routine and non-routine government audits and investigations; 

Dependence of our commercial work on certain sectors of the global economy that are highly cyclical; 

Failure to realize the full amount of our backlog; 

Risks inherent in being engaged in significant and complex disaster relief efforts and grant management programs involving multiple tiers of government in very stressful environments; 

Risks resulting from expanding our service offerings and client base; 

Difficulties in identifying attractive acquisitions available at acceptable prices; 

Acquisitions we undertake presenting integration challenges, failing to perform as expected, increasing our liabilities, and/or reducing our earnings; and 

Additional risks as a result of having international operations. 

Our forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and the information available to our management at the time these disclosures were prepared. Although we believe the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if our situation changes in the future. 
 The terms we, our, us, and the Company, as used throughout this Quarterly Report, refer to ICF International, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. The terms federal or federal government refer to the U.S. federal government, and state and local or state and local government refer to U.S. state and local governments and the governments of U.S. territories. The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024 (our Annual Report ).

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK 
 We provide professional services and technology-based solutions, including management, technology, and policy consulting and implementation services. We help our clients conceive, develop, implement, and improve solutions that address complex business, natural resource, social, technological, and public safety issues. Our services primarily support clients that operate in three key markets: 
 Energy, Environment, Infrastructure, and Disaster Recovery; 

Health and Social Programs; and 

Security and Other Civilian Commercial. 

We provide services to our diverse client base that deliver value throughout the entire life cycle of a policy, program, project, or initiative. Our primary services include: 
 Advisory Services; 

Program Implementation Services; 

Analytics Services; 

Digital Services; and 

Engagement Services. 

We report operating results and financial data as a single segment based on the consolidated information used by our chief operating decision-maker in evaluating the financial performance of our business and allocating resources. Our single segment represents our core business: professional services to our broad array of clients. Although we describe our multiple service offerings to clients that operate in three markets to provide a better understanding of the scope and scale of our business, we do not manage our business or allocate our resources based on those service offerings or client markets. Rather, on a project-by-project basis, we assemble the best team from throughout the enterprise to deliver highly customized solutions that are tailored to meet the needs of each client. 
 We believe that, in the long-term, demand for our services will continue to grow as government, industry, and other stakeholders seek to address critical long-term societal and natural resource issues due to heightened concerns about the environment and use of clean energy and energy efficiency; health promotion, treatment, and cost control; the means by which public health can be improved effectively on a cross-jurisdiction basis; natural disaster recovery and rebuild efforts; and ongoing homeland security threats. 
 We also see significant opportunity to further leverage our digital and client engagement capabilities across our client base. Our future results will depend on the success of our strategy to enhance our client relationships and seek larger engagements that span the entire program life cycle, and to complete and successfully integrate additional strategic acquisitions. We will continue to focus on building scale in our vertical and horizontal domain expertise, developing business with our existing clients as well as new customers, and replicating our business model in selective geographies. In doing so, we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that enhance our subject matter knowledge, broaden our service offerings, and/or provide scale in specific geographies. 
 Although we continue to see favorable long-term market opportunities, there are certain business challenges facing all government service providers. Administrative and legislative actions by the federal government to address changing priorities or in response to the budget deficit and/or debt ceiling could have a negative impact on our business, which may result in a reduction to our revenue and profit and adversely affect cash flow. Similarly, the very nature of opportunities arising out of disaster recovery means they can involve unusual challenges. Factors such as the overall stress on communities and people affected by disaster recovery situations, political complexities and challenges among involved government agencies, and a higher-than-normal risk of audits and investigations may result in a reduction to our revenue and profit and adversely affect cash flow. However, we believe we are well positioned to provide a broad range of services in support of initiatives that will continue to be priorities to the federal government, as well as to state and local and international governments and commercial clients.

Revenue. The increase in revenue was driven by 11.2 million, 2.7 million, and 2.3 million from our commercial, U.S. federal government, and U.S. state and local government clients, respectively, offset by a decrease of 0.7 million from our international government clients. Our revenue from client markets was impacted in varying amounts by our exit from the commercial marketing business during 2023. The following were changes in revenue from our various client markets: 
 Energy, Environment, Infrastructure, and Disaster Recovery client market revenues increased 31.3 million, or 15.3 , driven primarily by increases of 22.3 million, 8.3 million, and 0.8 million from commercial, U.S. federal government, and U.S. state and local government clients, respectively. 

Health and Social Programs client market revenues decreased 13.2 million, or 6.3 , driven by a decrease in subcontractor pass-through on several of our U.S. federal contracts and our exit from the commercial marketing business during 2023, resulting in decreases of 10.6 million, 2.5 million, and 1.8 million from U.S. federal government, commercial, and international government clients, respectively, offset by an increase of 1.7 million from U.S. state and local government clients. 

Security and Other Civilian Commercial client market revenues decreased 2.6 million, or 3.0 , primarily driven by our exit from the commercial marketing business during 2023 resulting in decreases of 8.7 million and 0.2 million from commercial and U.S. state and local government clients, respectively, offset by increases of 5.0 million and 1.3 million from U.S. federal government and international government clients, respectively. 

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes subcontractor and other direct costs, which decreased 8.5 million, or 6.3 , from the third quarter of 2023 and totaled 127.6 million and 136.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the margin on such costs. 
 Direct Costs . The increase of 1.5 million in direct costs was driven by an increase in direct labor and related fringe benefit costs which reflected the growth in the business, offset by a decrease in subcontractor and other direct costs as well as our exit from the commercial marketing and events business during 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, direct labor and related fringe benefit costs as a percentage of direct costs were 60.8 and 57.9 , respectively, and subcontractor and other direct costs as a percentage of direct costs were 39.2 and 42.1 , respectively. As a percentage of revenue, direct labor and related fringe benefit costs were 38.2 and 37.4 , respectively, and subcontractor and other direct costs were 24.7 and 27.1 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Total direct costs as a percentage of revenue were 62.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 20 

Indirect and selling expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our indirect and selling expenses increased by 1.3 million, or 1.0 , compared to the prior year, primarily from general and administrative costs. As a result, our indirect and selling expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 25.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 26.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization . The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to having fewer capital assets as a result of the divestiture of our U.S. commercial marketing business in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Amortization of intangible assets. The decrease in amortization of intangible assets was primarily due to having fewer intangible assets in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of the divestiture of our U.S. commercial marketing business in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Interest, net. The decrease of 3.4 million in interest, net, was primarily from a decrease of our average debt balance to 462.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 621.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our average debt balance was due, in part, to collection of receivables, decrease in our interest rates, as well as an increase in utilization of our Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (the MRPA with MUFG Bank, Ltd. MUFG ). Use of floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variable interest portion of our debt reduced our interest expense by 1.7 million compared to 2.1 million for the same period in 2023. Inclusive of the impact of the swap agreements, our interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.2 million compared to 8.8 million for the same period in 2023 and our interest rate inclusive of the swap agreements was 5.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.5 for 2023. 
 Other (expense) income. The change in other (expense) income of 3.6 million was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of 2.4 million recognized in the third quarter of 2023 and an impact of 1.5 million as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Provision for Income Taxes . Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 13.8 and 1.4 , respectively. The difference was primarily due to the deduction for worthless stock related to the wind-down of our commercial marketing business in the U.K. during the third quarter of 2023 which reduced effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 8 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report.

Revenue. The increase in revenue was driven by 15.1 million, 9.6 million, 7.4 million, and 6.5 million from commercial, U.S. federal government, U.S. state and local governments, and international government clients, respectively. Our revenue from client markets was impacted in varying amounts by our exit from the commercial marketing and events businesses during 2023. The following were changes in revenue from our various client markets: 
 Energy, Environment, Infrastructure, and Disaster Recovery client market revenues increased 97.5 million, or 16.4 , in 2024 compared to 2023, driven primarily by 66.7 million and 26.3 million from commercial and U.S. federal government clients, respectively. 

Health and Social Programs client market revenues decreased 35.8 million, or 5.8 , in 2024 compared to 2023. This was driven by a decrease in subcontractor pass-throughs on several of our U.S. federal contracts and our exit from the commercial marketing business during 2023, resulting in decreases of 32.7 million and 13.9 million from U.S. federal government and commercial clients, respectively, offset by increases of 5.8 million and 5.1 million from U.S. state and local government and international government clients, respectively. 

Security and Other Civilian Commercial client market revenues decreased 23.1 million, or 8.5 , in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by our exit from the commercial marketing and events business during 2023 resulting in decreases of 37.6 million and 1.3 million from commercial and international clients, respectively, offset by an increase of 16.0 million from U.S. federal government clients. 

Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes subcontractor and other direct costs, which decreased 24.8 million, or 6.1 , and totaled 380.9 million and 405.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the margin on such costs. 
 Direct Costs . The increase in direct costs was driven by an increase in direct labor and related fringe benefit costs which reflected the growth in the business, and offset by a decrease in subcontractor and other direct costs, primarily as a result of our exit from the commercial marketing and events business during 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, direct labor and related fringe benefit costs as a percentage of direct costs were 60.5 and 57.8 , respectively, and subcontractor and other direct costs as a percentage of total direct costs were 39.5 and 42.2 , respectively. As a percentage of revenue, direct labor and related fringe benefit costs were 38.3 and 37.4 , respectively, and subcontractor and other direct costs were 25.0 and 27.3 respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Total direct costs as a percentage of revenue were 63.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 22 

Indirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses as a percentage of revenue were consistent at 25.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.7 for 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization . The decrease in our depreciation and amortization was primarily due to having fewer capital assets primarily as a result of the divestiture of our U.S. commercial marketing business in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Amortization of intangible assets. The decrease in amortization of intangible assets was primarily due to having fewer intangible assets primarily as a result of the divestiture of our U.S. commercial marketing business in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Interest, net. The decrease in interest, net, was primarily from a decrease of our average debt balance to 488.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 641.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our average debt balance was due, in part, to collection of receivables, decrease in our interest rates, as well as an increase in the utilization of the MRPA. Use of floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variable interest portion of our debt reduced our interest expense by 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.2 million for the same period in 2023. Inclusive of the impact of the swap agreements, our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.1 million compared to 26.9 million for 2023 and our interest rate inclusive of the swap agreements was 5.4 and 5.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other income. The change in other income was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Provision for Income Taxes . Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 20.0 and 9.4 , respectively. The difference was primarily due to the impact of a tax planning strategy regarding the ownership structure of our Canadian subsidiaries implemented during 2023 as well as the deduction for worthless stock related to the wind-down of our commercial marketing business in the U.K. during the third quarter of 2023 which reduced the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 8 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 The following tables provide reconciliations of financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures non-GAAP ). While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information to investors and may be useful in evaluating our financial information and assessing ongoing trends to better understand our operations, they should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies may define similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently, thus limiting their use for comparability. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Earnings before interest, tax, and depreciation and amortization EBITDA is a measure we use to evaluate operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations Adjusted EBITDA ). We evaluate these adjustments on an individual basis based on both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including their size and nature, as well as whether we expect them to recur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow as these measures do not include certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, capital expenditures, and debt service.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity and Borrowing Capacity . In addition to cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from operations, our primary source of liquidity is from our Credit Facility with a syndicate of multiple commercial banks, as described in Note 5 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. The Credit Facility requires that we remain in compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants (as defined by the Credit Agreement, see our Annual Report for additional details). As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants and we had 588.2 million available under the Credit Facility to fund our ongoing operations, future acquisitions, dividend payments, and share repurchase program. 
 We have entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements for a total notional value of 275.0 million to hedge a portion of our floating-rate Credit Facility. The swap agreements will expire in 2025 and 2028, respectively, and we may consider entering into additional swap agreements as these existing hedges expire. As of September 30, 2024, the percentage of our fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt was 65 . 
 There are other conditions, such as the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, that create uncertainty in the global economy, which in turn may impact, among other things, our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and our ability to successfully execute and fund key initiatives. However, our current belief is that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund ongoing operations, customary capital expenditures, quarterly cash dividends, share repurchases, and organic growth. Additionally, we continuously analyze our capital structure to ensure we have capital to fund future strategic acquisitions. 
 We continuously monitor the state of the financial markets to assess the availability of borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and the cost of additional capital from both debt and equity markets. At present, we believe we will be able to continue to access these markets at commercially reasonable terms and conditions if we need additional capital in the near term. 
 Dividends. We have historically paid quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders of record at 0.14 per share. Total dividend payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.9 million. 
 Cash dividends declared thus far in 2024 are as follows:

Cash provided by operating activities increased by 30.6 million to 76.2 million as a result of higher net income, the net favorable impact of working capital changes, including the timing of servicing the receivables sold to MUFG under the MRPA. See Note 3 Contract Receivables, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for additional details on the sale of receivables under the MRPA. 
 Cash used in investing activities increased by 10.2 million due to the timing of acquisitions and cash received in connection with the 2023 divestiture of our U.S. commercial marketing business. 
 Cash used in financing activities increased by 17.5 million due to increases in share repurchases and net repayments of our borrowings.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualit ative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes in the disclosures discussed in the section entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report. 
 Item 4. Contr ols and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting . Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934) and have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Leg al Proceedings 
 We are involved in various legal matters and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While these matters and proceedings cause us to incur costs, including, but not limited to, attorneys fees, we currently believe that any ultimate liability arising out of these matters and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 There have been no material changes in the risk factors discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report. 
 The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks that we encounter. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Eq uity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Share Repurchase Program. One of the objectives of our share repurchase program has been to offset dilution resulting from our employee incentive plan. The timing and extent to which we repurchase our shares will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations, as may be considered in our sole discretion. Repurchases are funded from our existing cash balances and/or borrowings, and repurchased shares are held as treasury stock. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, 67.2 million of repurchase authority remained available for share repurchases. 
 Repurchases of Equity Securities. The following table summarizes the share repurchase activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for our share repurchase program and shares purchased in satisfaction of employee tax withholding obligations related to the settlement of restricted stock units.

(1) The total number of shares purchased includes shares purchased from employees to pay required withholding taxes related to the settlement of restricted stock units in accordance with our applicable long-term incentive plan. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 2,383 shares of common stock from employees in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations at an average price of 157.67 per share. 

(2) The current share repurchase program authorizes share repurchases in the aggregate up to 200.0 million. Our Credit Facility permits annual share repurchases of at least 25.0 million provided that the Company is not in default of its covenants, and higher amounts provided that our Consolidated Leverage Ratio prior to and after giving effect to such repurchases is 0.50 to 1.00 less than the then-applicable maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and subject to a net liquidity of 100.00 million.
