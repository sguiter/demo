The Company evaluates its available for sale securities portfolio for impairment on a quarterly basis. The Company did t recognize unrealized losses in income because it has the ability and the intent to hold and does not expect to be required to sell these securities until the recovery of their cost basis. The quarterly impairment assessment takes into account the changes in the credit quality of these debt securities since acquisition and the likelihood of a credit loss occurring over the life of the securities. In the event that a credit loss is expected to occur in the future, an allowance is established and a corresponding credit loss is recognized. Based on this analysis, as of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that no credit losses were expected to be realized on the tax-exempt municipal bond portfolio. The remainder of the portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. government sponsored agency securities, all of which have the backing of the U.S. government, and are therefore not expected to incur credit losses.)

are individually evaluated for the amount of impairment, if any. Nonperforming loans with a carrying balance of or less are evaluated collectively. However, from time to time, nonrecurring fair value adjustments to collateral dependent nonperforming loans, for which repayment is expected to be obtained through the sale of the underlying collateral, are recorded based on either the current appraised value of the collateral, or management s judgment, that are then adjusted based on recent market trends. When the fair value of the collateral is less than the book value, a valuation allowance is established to carry the loan at the fair value of the collateral, and results in a Level 3 measurement. OREO - Fair value of OREO is based primarily on third party appraisals, less costs to sell and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Appraisals are required annually and may be updated more frequently as circumstances require and the fair value adjustments are made to OREO based on the updated appraised value of the property. Servicing assets - On a quarterly basis, the Company utilizes a third party service to evaluate servicing assets related to loans sold to unaffiliated parties with servicing retained, and result in a Level 3 classification. Servicing assets are assessed for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date. Other repossessed assets Fair value of equipment from equipment financing agreements is based primarily on a third party valuation service, less costs to sell and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Valuations are required at the time the asset is repossessed and may be subsequently updated periodically due to the Company s short-term possession of the asset prior to sale or as circumstances require and the fair value adjustments are made to the asset based on its value prior to sale.

 (1) Appraisal reports utilize a combination of valuation techniques including a market approach, where prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar or comparable properties are used to determine the appraised value. Appraisals may include an as is and upon completion valuation scenarios. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by third-party appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data. Adjustments also result from the consideration of relevant economic and demographic factors with the potential to affect property values. Also, prospective values are based on the market conditions which exist at the date of inspection combined with informed forecasts based on current trends in supply and demand for the property types under appraisal. Positive adjustments disclosed in this table represent increases to the sales comparison and negative adjustments represent decreases.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 We have established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of our financial statements.

We had no significant changes in our accounting policies since the filing of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, and we consider these critical accounting policies. For a description of these critical accounting policies, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.

Results of Operations 
 Net Interest Income 
 Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest derived from earning assets, and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, referred to as rate changes. Interest rates charged on loans receivable are affected principally by changes to market interest rates, the demand for loans receivable, the supply of money available for lending purposes, and other competitive factors. Those factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the Federal Reserve.

The following table shows the average balance of assets, liabilities and stockholders equity; the amount of interest income, and interest expense; the average yield or rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and the net interest spread and the net interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis for the periods indicated.

 47 

money market and savings accounts and borrowings increased by 284.0 million and 23.1 million, respectively, offset partially by decreases in interest-bearing demand deposits and time deposits of 11.1 million and 10.4 million, respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was 106.8 million, an increase of 5.5 million, or 5.4 , compared with 101.3 million for the same period in 2023, primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits, data processing, professional fees, and other operating expenses. Salaries and employee benefits increased 1.5 million due to higher salaries, group insurance, and share-based compensation expense, offset primarily by capitalized labor costs associated with the Company's investment in a new loan origination system. Data processing expense increased 0.9 million due to an increase in software license and maintenance expense in 2024. Professional fees decreased 0.9 million primarily due to increases in consulting fees, and legal fees related to loan matters. All other operating expenses increased 1.3 million mainly due to a 0.6 million increase in loan and deposit-related expenses and a 0.4 million SBA servicing asset adjustment. Repossessed personal property expense increased mainly due to a 0.8 million loss on sale of lease assets. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 6.2 million and 7.9 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 29.5 and 29.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense was 18.8 million and 25.7 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 29.7 and 29.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Financial Condition 
 Securities 
 As of September 30, 2024, our securities portfolio consisted of U.S. government agency and sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and debt securities, tax-exempt municipal bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. Most of these securities carry fixed interest rates. Other than holdings of U.S. government agency and sponsored agency obligations, there were no securities of any one issuer exceeding 10 of stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Securities increased 43.2 million to 908.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 865.7 million at December 31, 2023, mainly attributed to 128.3 million in securities purchases, partially offset by 105.9 million in payments and maturities, and a decrease in unrealized securities losses of 22.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Special mention loans were 131.6 million and 65.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 66.3 million increase included downgrades from pass loans of 130.0 million, offset by upgrades to pass loans of 10.3 million, downgrades to classified loans of 36.3 million, and paydowns and payoffs of 17.0 million. Additions during the third quarter of 2024 included the downgrade to the special mention category of two commercial real estate loans in the hospitality industry for 109.7 million and a commercial and industrial loan in the health care industry for 20.1 million, all of which were current and fully collateralized at September 30, 2024. Reductions during the third quarter of 2024 included the downgrade from the special mention category to the classified category of a 28.3 million completed construction loan for a memory care and assisted-living facility. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, the 28.3 million loan was transferred from classified to held-for-sale after the Bank recognized a 1.1 million charge-off on this loan. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the Bank completed the sale of the loan for 27.2 million (see Note 16 - Subsequent Events , for more information). Additional reductions in special mention loans during the third quarter resulted from upgrades of 6.1 million 
 
 Classified loans were 28.4 million and 31.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Classified loan activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included increases primarily due to loan downgrades of 47.0 million that included the 28.3 special mention construction loan, offset by paydowns and payoffs of 18.2 million, 4.5 million in loan charge-offs, and the transfer, after the charge-off, of the 27.2 million construction loan to the held-for-sale nonaccrual category. 
 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and OREO. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than 90 days past due, unless we believe the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection. However, in certain instances, we may place a particular loan on nonaccrual status earlier, depending upon the individual circumstances surrounding the loan s delinquency. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income. Subsequent collections of cash are applied as principal reductions when received, except when the ultimate collectability of principal is probable, in which case interest payments are credited to income. Nonaccrual 
 55 

loans may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest become current and full repayment is expected, which generally occurs after sustained payment of six months. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis for loans not meeting the criteria for nonaccrual. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means. 
 Except for nonaccrual loans, management is not aware of any other loans as of September 30, 2024 for which known credit problems of the borrower would cause serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms, or any known events that would result in a loan being designated as nonperforming at some future date. 
 Nonaccrual loans were 15.2 million and 15.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 0.3 million, or 2.1 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 1.90 and 1.25 of equipment financing agreements were on nonaccrual status, respectively. At September 30, 2024 there were 242,000 loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. At December 31, 2023, all loans 90 days or more past due were classified as nonaccrual. 
 The 15.2 million of nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2024 had individually evaluated allowances of 5.2 million, compared to 15.5 million of nonperforming loans with individually evaluated allowances of 3.4 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Nonperforming assets were 16.3 million at September 30, 2024, or 0.21 of total assets, compared to 15.6 million, or 0.21 , at December 31, 2023. Additionally, not included in nonperforming assets were repossessed personal property assets associated with equipment finance agreements of 1.2 million and 1.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Individually Evaluated Loans 
 The Company reviews loans on an individual basis when the loan does not share similar risk characteristics with loan pools. Individually evaluated loans are measured for expected credit losses based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate, the observable market price, or the fair value of collateral. 
 
 Individually evaluated loans were 15.2 million and 15.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 0.2 million, or 1.3 . Specific allowances associated with individually evaluated loans increased 1.8 million to 5.2 million as of September 30, 2024 compared with 3.4 million as of December 31, 2023, mainly attributed to specific reserve allocation on newly added nonperforming equipment finance agreements. 
 
 A borrower is experiencing financial difficulties when there is a probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. The Company may modify loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by providing principal forgiveness, a term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or an interest rate reduction. 
 
 The following table presents loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification, with related amortized cost balances, respective percentage shares of the total class of loans, and the related financial effect, for the periods indicated:

The modified loan above was current at September 30, 2024. 
 
 No loans were modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses Related to Off-Balance Sheet Items 
 The Company s estimate of the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflected losses expected over the remaining contractual life of assets based on historical, current, and forward-looking information. The contractual term does not consider extensions, renewals or modifications. 
 56 

Management selected three loss methodologies for the collective allowance estimation. At September 30, 2024, the Company used the discounted cash flow DCF method to estimate allowances for credit losses for the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, the Probability of Default/Loss Given Default PD/LGD method for the commercial real estate, construction and residential real estate portfolios, and the Weighted Average Remaining Maturity WARM method to estimate expected credit losses for equipment financing agreements. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are individually evaluated for allowances. 
 
 For all loans utilizing the DCF method, the Company determined that four quarters represented a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverted to a historical loss rate over twelve quarters on a straight-line basis. For this loan segment, the Company applied an annualized historical PD/LGD using all available historical periods. Since reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions are embedded directly into the DCF model, qualitative adjustments are considered but were minimal. 
 
 For each of the loan segments identified above, the Company applied an annualized historical PD/LGD using all available historical periods. The PD/LGD method incorporates a forecast of economic conditions into loss estimates using a qualitative adjustment. 
 
 For loan pools utilizing the PD/LGD method, the Company used historical periods that included an economic downturn to derive historical losses for better alignment in the estimation of expected losses under the PD/LGD method. The Company relied on Frye-Jacobs-modeled LGD rates for loan segments with insufficient historical loss data. The Frye-Jacobs model provides a means of applying an LGD rate in the event that limited to no loss data is available. The PD/LGD method incorporates a forecast into loss estimates using a qualitative adjustment. 
 
 The Company used the WARM method to estimate expected credit losses for the equipment financing agreements portfolio. The Company applied an expected loss ratio based on internal historical losses adjusted as appropriate for qualitative factors. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company relied on the economic projections from Moody s to inform its loss driver forecasts over the four-quarter forecast period. For all loan pools, the Company utilizes and forecasts the national unemployment rate as the primary loss driver. 
 
 To adjust the historical and forecast periods to current conditions, the Company applies various qualitative factors derived from market, industry or business specific data, changes in the underlying portfolio composition, trends relating to credit quality, delinquent and nonperforming loans and adversely-rated equipment financing agreements, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions.

The allowance for credit losses was 69.2 million and 69.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance attributed to individually evaluated loans was 5.2 million and 3.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance attributed to collectively evaluated loans was 64.0 million and 66.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and considered the impact of changes in macroeconomic assumptions, normalized interest rate forecasts for the subsequent four quarters, and a net reduction in specific qualitative factors allocated to criticized hospitality loans impacted by the pandemic. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet items, primarily unfunded loan commitments, was 2.0 million and 2.5 million, respectively. The Bank closely monitors the borrower s repayment capabilities, while funding existing commitments to ensure losses are minimized. Based on management s evaluation and analysis of portfolio credit quality and prevailing economic conditions, we believe these allowances were adequate for current expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio and off-balance sheet exposure as of September 30, 2024.

Total deposits were 6.40 billion and 6.28 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing an increase of 122.6 million, or 2.0 . The increase in deposits was primarily driven by a 164.2 million increase in money market and savings deposits and a 48.2 million increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a 81.6 million decrease in time deposits. At September 30, 2024, the loan-to-deposit ratio was 97.7 compared to 98.4 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of uninsured deposits (deposits in amounts greater than 250,000, which is the maximum amount for federal deposit insurance) was 2.67 billion. The aggregate amount of uninsured time deposits was 651.4 million. Other uninsured deposits, such as demand and money market and savings deposits were 2.02 billion. At September 30, 2024, 1.17 billion of total uninsured deposits were in accounts with balances of 5.0 million or more. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of uninsured deposits was 2.52 billion. The aggregate amount of uninsured time deposits was 681.0 million. 
 59 

Other uninsured deposits, such as demand, money market and savings deposits were 1.84 billion. At December 31, 2023, 1.09 billion of total uninsured deposits were in accounts with balances of 5.0 million or more. 
 
 The Bank s wholesale funds historically consisted of FHLB advances, brokered deposits as well as State of California time deposits. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had 300.0 million and 325.0 million of FHLB advances, and 13.2 million and 58.3 million of brokered deposits, respectively, and 120.0 million of State of California time deposits, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The decrease in brokered deposits was due to the Bank utilizing more overnight FHLB borrowings as a funding source. 
 
 Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures 
 Borrowings mostly take the form of FHLB advances. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FHLB advances were 300.0 million and 325.0 million, respectively. FHLB open advances were 200.0 million and 212.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For the same periods, term advances were 100.0 million and 112.5 million, respectively. Funds from deposit growth not used to fund loan production were used to pay off borrowings. 
 
 The weighted-average interest rate of all FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 4.81 and 4.69 , respectively. 
 
 The FHLB maximum amount outstanding at any month end during each of the year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 350.0 million and 450.0 million, respectively.

Subordinated debentures are comprised of fixed-to-floating subordinated notes of 108.5 million and 108.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of 22.0 million and 21.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 8 Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures to the consolidated financial statements for more details. 
 
 Stockholders' Equity 
 Stockholders equity was 736.7 million and 701.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net income, net of 22.8 million of dividends paid, added 21.7 million to stockholders' equity for the period, as did 2.7 million of share-based compensation, and a 16.4 million decrease in unrealized after-tax losses on securities available for sale due to changes in interest rates, offset by a 0.4 million decrease in unrealized after-tax losses on cash flow hedges. In addition, the Company repurchased 345,000 shares of common stock during the period at an average share price of 16.68 for a total cost of 5.8 million. At September 30, 2024, 1,425,000 shares remain under the Company's share repurchase program. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 The spread between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities is the principal component of net interest income, and interest rate changes substantially affect our financial performance. We emphasize capital protection through stable earnings. In order to achieve stable earnings, we prudently manage our assets and liabilities and closely monitor the percentage changes in net interest income and equity value in relation to limits established within our guidelines. 
 The Company performs simulation modeling to estimate the potential effects of interest rate changes. The following table summarizes one of the stress simulations performed to forecast the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the value of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reflected on our balance sheet (i.e., an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of the magnitude indicated below) as of September 30, 2024. The Company compares this stress simulation to policy 
 60 

limits, which specify the maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a 1- to 12-month and a 13- to 24- month horizon, given the basis point adjustment in interest rates reflected below.

The estimated sensitivity does not necessarily represent our forecast, and the results may not be indicative of actual changes to our net interest income. These estimates are based upon a number of assumptions, including the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes, prepayments on loans receivable and securities, pricing strategies on loans receivable and deposits, and replacement of asset and liability cash flows. 
 
 The key assumptions, based upon loans receivable, securities and deposits, are as follows: 

Conditional prepayment rates : 

Loans receivable 

14 

Securities 

6 

Deposit rate betas : 

NOW, savings, money market demand 

48 

Time deposits, retail and wholesale 

75 

Balance-weighted average 

While the assumptions used are based on current economic and local market conditions, there is no assurance as to the predictive nature of these conditions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Capital Resources 
 Historically, our primary source of capital has been the retention of operating earnings. In order to ensure adequate capital levels, the Board regularly assesses projected sources and uses of capital, expected loan growth, anticipated strategic actions (such as stock repurchases and dividends), and projected capital thresholds under adverse and severely adverse economic conditions. In addition, the Board considers the Company s access to capital from financial markets through the issuance of additional debt and securities, including common stock or notes, to meet its capital needs. 
 The Company s ability to pay dividends to stockholders depends in part upon dividends it receives from the Bank. California law restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank s retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to stockholders made during such period). Where the above test is not met, cash dividends may still be paid, with the prior approval of the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation DFPI ), in an amount not exceeding the 
 61 

greater of: (1) retained earnings of the Bank; (2) net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year; or (3) the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year. The Company paid dividends of 22.8 million 0.75 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 30.5 million 1.00 per share) for the year 2023. As of October 1, 2024, the Bank has the ability to pay dividends of approximately 136.0 million, after giving effect to the 0.25 dividend declared on October 24, 2024, for the fourth quarter of 2024, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of the DFPI. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank s total risk-based capital ratio of 14.27 , Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.23 , common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.23 and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 11.43 placed the Bank in the well capitalized category pursuant to capital rules, which is defined as institutions with total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 10.00 , Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 8.00 , common equity Tier 1 capital ratios equal to or greater than 6.50 , and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than 5.00 . 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 15.03 , Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.29 , common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95 and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.56 .

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management is responsible for the disclosure controls and procedures of the Corporation. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required by the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
