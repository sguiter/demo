 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Throughout this quarterly report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report ), we make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, plan, intend, believe, may, will, should, can have, likely and other words and terms of similar meaning. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are generally located in the material set forth under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations but may be found in other locations as well. These statements are based upon management s current expectations, assumptions and estimates and are not guarantees of timing, future results or performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected, including: 
 our history of net losses, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in an environment of increasing expenses; 
 the effect of our relatively limited operating history on investors ability to evaluate our current business and future prospects; 
 the viability of our growth strategy and our ability to realize expected results; 
 our ability to attract new members and to successfully enter into new markets; 
 the quality and pricing of our products and services; 
 our ability to maintain a high rating for our health plans on the Five Star Quality Rating System; 
 our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with care providers who service our members; 
 our ability to manage our growth effectively, execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and member satisfaction or adequately address competitive challenges; 
 our ability to compete in the healthcare industry; 
 the impact on our business of security breaches, loss of data or other disruptions causing the compromise of sensitive information or preventing us from accessing critical information; 
 the impact on our business of disruptions in our disaster recovery systems or management continuity planning; 
 the cost of legal proceedings and litigation, including intellectual property and privacy disputes; 
 our dependence on reimbursements by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and premium payments by individuals; 
 other risks associated with being a government contractor; 
 the impact on our business of the healthcare services industry becoming more cyclical; 
 our ability to manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully; 
 our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our reputation and brand recognition; 
 our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems;

Table of Contents 

 our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology; 
 the potential adverse impact of claims by third parties that we are infringing on, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights; 
 the impact of any restrictions on our use of or ability to license data or our failure to license data and integrate third-party technologies; 
 our dependence on our senior management team and other key employees; 
 the concentration of our health plans in a limited number of U.S. states; 
 our management team s limited experience managing a public company; 
 our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and the potential impact of certain affirmative and negative covenants in our term loan agreement on our business; 
 the impact of shortages of qualified personnel and related increases in our labor costs; 
 the risk that our records may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information regarding risk adjustment scores of members; 
 our ability to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical expenses; 
 the impact of negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry; 
 the impact of weather and other factors beyond our control on our clinics, the centers out of which our external providers operate, and the facilities that host our AVA platform (as defined below); 
 the impact on our business of renegotiation, non-renewal or termination of risk agreements with hospitals, physicians, nurses, pharmacists and medical support staff; 
 risks associated with estimating the amount of liabilities that we recognize under our risk agreements with providers; 
 our ability to respond to general economic conditions, including but not limited to, increased inflation and higher interest rates; 
 risks associated with an economic downturn, including pressure on governmental budgets and reduced spending for health and human service programs; 
 our ability to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting; 
 the impact of state and federal efforts to reduce Medicare spending; 
 our ability to comply with applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, including those relating to data privacy and security; and 
 other factors disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based on many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under the sections entitled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report.

You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report in the context of these risks and uncertainties. 
 We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.

 and , respectively. 
 Prior to 2024, the ACO acted as a principal in arranging for and controlling services provided directly by their contracts with primary care physicians, as well as services provided by preferred institutional care providers and specialists. Capitation payments for the ACO program were determined from an annual benchmark established by CMS. These payments, which were adjusted for variable considerations, represented revenue for providing health care services, including primary care as well as institutional and specialist care. The ACO recognized capitation revenue for providing these services in the period in which the performance obligations were satisfied by transferring services to the members. Revenue recognized by the ACO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. 
 Interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively. Interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. 
 Revenue Adjustments 
 . The MLR represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue. The Code of Federal Regulations defines what constitutes medical costs and premium revenue, including certain additional expenses related to improving the quality of care provided, and the exclusion of certain taxes and fees, in each case as permitted or required by CMS and applicable regulatory requirements. If the minimum MLR is not met, we are required to remit a portion of the premiums back to the federal government. The amount remitted, if any, is recognized as an adjustment to premium revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The amounts payable under this provision were immaterial at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Medicare Part D payments are also subject to a federal risk corridor program, which limits a health plan s overall losses or profit if actual spending for basic Medicare Part D benefits is much higher or lower than what was anticipated. Risk corridor is recorded within premium revenue. The risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids or third-party payors bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS or third-party payors making additional payments to us or require us to refund a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenue related to these provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience. We record a

 on brand-name prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. The majority of the discounts are funded by the pharmaceutical manufacturers, while we fund a smaller portion and administer the application of the total discount. 
 These Subsidies represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program and are recorded as deposits or payables. These Subsidies received in excess of, or less than, actual subsidized benefits paid are refundable to or recoverable from CMS through an annual reconciliation process following the end of the contract year.

 Equity-Based Compensation 
 . 
 Equity-based compensation expense for RSU awards with performance-based vesting is recognized over the requisite service period on a graded vesting schedule and is only recognized when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition(s) will be achieved. At each reporting period, the Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance criteria. Determining whether the performance criteria will be achieved involves judgment, and the estimate of share-based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance criteria. Revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed. We account for forfeitures as they occur. 
 Equity-based compensation is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses, and medical expenses based on the function of the applicable employee and non-employee.

 The carrying value of long-term debt represents the outstanding balance, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our long-term debt approximates the carrying value. 
 Our nonfinancial assets and liabilities, which include goodwill, intangible assets, property, and equipment, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. However, on a periodic basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable, we assess these assets for impairment. We recorded an impairment charge related to intangible assets as of September 30, 2024. See note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. There was such impairment as of December 31, 2023. 
 U.S. Treasury Securities Investments 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and , respectively, of investments in U.S. Treasury bills which were classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost. These investments are included in short-term investments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as the original maturities are greater than three months and less than twelve months.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and , respectively, of investments in U.S. Treasury bill money market funds with an original maturity of less than three months. These investments are considered cash equivalents and are included in cash and cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balances sheets. 
 Restricted Investments 
 and of restricted investments in U.S. Treasury bills and and of restricted investments in certificates of deposits, respectively. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until maturity; therefore, these investments are stated at amortized cost. Restricted investments are required to be maintained at a financial institution within certain states. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these investments had maturities with less than 12 months. Due to the nature of the state's requirements, these assets are classified as noncurrent assets regardless of the contractual maturity date.

 Pharmacy rebate receivables Other receivables Total accounts receivable Allowance for credit losses ) Accounts receivable, net 
 The allowance for expected credit losses for accounts receivable is based primarily on past collections experience relative to the length of time receivables are past due. However, when available evidence reasonably supports an assumption that future economic conditions will differ from current and historical payment collections, an adjustment is reflected in the allowance for expected credit losses. We record pharmacy rebates and other receivables based on contractual terms and expected collections and our estimation process for contractual allowances for such balances generally results in an allowance for balances outstanding greater than 90 days or if expected credit risks are known. 
 Receivables and any associated allowance are written off only when all collection attempts have failed and such amounts are determined unrecoverable. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances based on a variety of factors, including age of the outstanding receivable and collection history. When circumstances related to specific collection patterns change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables are adjusted. Because substantially all of our receivable amounts are readily determinable and a large portion of our creditors are governmental authorities, our allowance for credit losses is insignificant. 
 We recorded a credit loss related to accounts receivable of and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The amounts were recorded in selling general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 Each period, we re-examine previously established outstanding claims reserve estimates based on actual claims submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in claim costs in the period in which the change is identified. Substantially, all of the total claims paid by us are known and settled within the first year from the date of service, and substantially, all remaining claim amounts are paid within a period.

We incurred additional debt issuance costs of related to attorney fees and other third-party costs. We also incurred an origination fee of related to the draw down of the Delayed Draw Term Loans. The commitment and origination fees are included within debt issuance costs and were deferred and will be amortized to interest expense over the debt term using the straight line method, which is materially consistent with the effective interest method. The debt issuance costs related to the initial Term Loan are presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the term loan. The debt issuance costs related to the Delayed Draw Term Loan are presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as other assets. 
 The Term Loans are jointly and severally guaranteed by Alignment Healthcare, Inc. and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and collateralized by all unrestricted assets. 
 The Oxford Loan Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, judgment defaults, insolvency and bankruptcy defaults, and change of control. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Oxford Loan Agreement, termination of the Term Loan commitments and the right to foreclose on the collateral securing the obligations. During the existence of an event of default, the outstanding Term Loans will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to plus the otherwise applicable interest rate. Additionally, in the event of any contemplated asset sale or series of asset sales yielding net proceeds in excess of , except those excluded per the Oxford Loan Agreement, we are required to prepay the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans in an amount equal to the entire amount of the asset sale net proceeds, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 
 The Oxford Loan Agreement includes financial covenants that require the Borrower Parties to (i) maintain minimum liquidity, as defined in the Loan Agreement, of and (ii) satisfy a maximum permitted ratio of debt to trailing twelve-month revenue, as set forth in the Loan Agreement.

The change in tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to a change in state taxes. Our future effective tax rate may vary from the statutory tax rate primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance, state taxes, and excess executive compensation. 
 We have federal and state cumulative net operating losses ("NOLs") as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Given the history of losses, and after consideration for the risk associated with estimates of future taxable income, we established a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA ), federal NOLs generated after 2017 will be carried forward indefinitely but are limited to an deduction of taxable income. NOLs generated prior to 2018 have a 20-year carryforward period and can be used to offset of taxable income. An exception to the TCJA federal NOL rule applies to certain of our subsidiaries and requires all NOLs generated from those entities to have a 20-year carryforward period and offset of taxable income.

On June 27, 2024, California Senate Bill 167 SB 167 was enacted into law, suspending California NOL utilization for taxpayers with more than 1 million of taxable income, effective for tax years 2024, 2025, and 2026. SB 167 includes an extended carryover period for the suspended NOLs with an additional year carryforward for each year of suspension. The Company will continue to monitor this legislation and its impact on our deferred tax assets. 
 An ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"), could potentially limit the ability to utilize certain tax attributes including the Company s substantial NOLs. Ownership change is generally defined as any significant change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a three-year testing period. If, as a result of current or future transactions involving our common stock, we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over a testing period, our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under IRC Section 382. We continue to monitor changes in ownership with respect to these income tax provisions.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes as well as Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our "Annual Report"), as well as our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes presented herein in Part I, Item 1 included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, the terms we , our and the Company as used herein refer to Alignment Healthcare, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Alignment Healthcare Holdings, LLC, which is Alignment Healthcare, Inc. s predecessor for financial reporting purposes. 
 In addition to historical data, the discussion contains forward-looking statements about the business, operations and financial performance of the Company based on our current expectations that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed above in "Forward-Looking Statements," and Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors. 
 
 Overview 
 Alignment is a next generation, consumer-centric platform designed to improve the healthcare experience for seniors. We deliver this experience through our Medicare Advantage plans, which are customized to meet the needs of a diverse array of seniors. Our innovative model of consumer-centric healthcare is purpose-built to provide seniors with care as it should be: high quality, low cost and accompanied by a vastly improved consumer experience. We combine a proprietary technology platform and a high-touch clinical model that enhances our members lifestyles and health outcomes while simultaneously controlling costs, which allows us to reinvest savings back into our platform and products to directly benefit the senior consumers. We have grown Health Plan Membership, which we define as members enrolled in our health maintenance organization ("HMO") and preferred provider organization ("PPO") contracts (the "Alignment Health Plans"), from approximately 13,000 at inception to 182,300 as of September 30, 2024, representing a 30 compound annual growth rate across 53 markets and 6 states. Our ultimate goal is to bring this differentiated, advocacy-driven healthcare experience to millions of senior consumers in the United States and to become the most trusted senior healthcare brand in the country. 
 Our model is based on a flywheel concept, referred to as our virtuous cycle, which is designed to delight our senior consumers. We start by listening to and engaging with our seniors in order to provide a superior experience in both their healthcare and daily living needs. Through our proprietary technology platform, Alignment's Virtual Application ("AVA"), we utilize data and predictive algorithms that are specifically designed to ensure personalized care is delivered to each member. When our information-enabled care model is combined with our member engagement, we are able to improve healthcare outcomes by, for example, reducing unnecessary hospital admissions, which in turn lowers overall costs. Our ability to manage healthcare expenditures while maintaining quality and member satisfaction is a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage. Our lower total healthcare expenditures allow us to reinvest our savings into richer coverage and benefits, which propels our growth in revenue and membership due to the enhanced consumer value proposition. As we grow, we continue to listen to and incorporate member feedback, and we are able to further enhance benefits and produce strong clinical outcomes. Our virtuous cycle, based on the principle of doing well by doing good, is highly repeatable and a core tenet of our ability to continue to expand in existing and new markets in the future. 
 For the 2024 plan year, Alignment offers plans in 53 markets across California (22 markets), North Carolina (16 markets), Nevada (6 markets), Arizona (3 markets), Texas (2 markets) and Florida (4 markets). There are approximately 8.7 million Medicare-eligible seniors in our current markets. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Our proprietary technology platform, AVA, is a key element of our business with capabilities that we expect to impact our future performance. AVA enables us to personalize and manage our member relationships, care quality and experience, and to coordinate and manage risk with our provider partners. AVA s unified platform, analytical tools and data across the healthcare ecosystem enable us to produce consistent outcomes, unit economics and support new member growth.

 Additionally, our historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future will be, driven by our ability to: 
 Capitalize on Our Existing Market Growth Opportunity: Our ability to attract and retain members to grow in our existing markets depends on our ability to offer a superior value proposition. We have proven that we can compete against, and take market share from, large established players in highly competitive markets. According to CMS data, we were one of the top three Medicare Advantage Organizations in terms of HMO net members growth in our California counties between 2016 and 2024. There are approximately 4.7 million Medicare-eligible individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in our existing 53 counties, of which our approximately 182,300 Health Plan Members represent only 4 market share. We believe that there are still significant opportunities for future growth even in our most mature markets where we have a 10-35 market share. Additionally, we are evaluating other opportunities to leverage our historical investments in our technology platform and our comprehensive clinical model across our existing and potentially new geographies. 
 Drive Growth and Consistent Outcomes Through New Market Expansion: We enter new markets with the goal of building brand awareness across our key stakeholders to achieve meaningful market share over time. We intend to focus on markets with significant senior populations where we expect to be able to replicate our model most effectively. Our existing markets also feature a diverse array of membership profiles across ethnicities, income levels and acuity. In 2023 we expanded into 14 new markets across our four existing states and two new states, Florida and Texas, and in 2024, we expanded into one new market in California. 
 Provide Superior Service, Care and Consumer Satisfaction: We are highly focused on providing superior service and care to our members and on maintaining high levels of consumer satisfaction, which are key to our financial performance and growth. The CMS Five Star Quality Rating System provides economic incentives to Medicare Advantage plans that achieve higher Star ratings by (i) meeting certain care criteria (such as completing particular preventative screening procedures or ensuring proper follow-up care is provided for specific conditions or episodes) and (ii) receiving high member satisfaction ratings. These incentives impact financial performance in the year following the CMS Rating Year (for example, CMS s announcement of the 2024 Ratings occurred in the second half of 2023 and will impact our financial performance in 2025). In aggregate, more than 90 of our health plan members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars and above, meaning the vast majority of members consistently receive a high-quality care experience, as defined under CMS star measurement criteria. Additionally, the California HMO plan has achieved a 4-star or greater rating for seven consecutive years. 
 Effectively Manage the Quality of Care to Improve Member Outcomes: Our care delivery model is based on a clinical continuum through which we have created a highly personalized experience that is unique to each member depending on their personal health and circumstances. Utilizing data and predictive analytics generated by AVA, our clinical continuum separates seniors into four categories in order to provide optimized care for every stage of a senior s life: healthy, healthy utilizer, pre-chronic and chronic. We partner with our broader network of community providers to service members in our non-chronic categories, and we have developed a Care Anywhere program implemented by our internal clinical teams to care for our higher risk and/or chronically ill members. By investing in our members care proactively, our model has consistently reduced unnecessary and costly care while improving the quality of our members lifestyle and healthcare experience. By delivering superior care and preventing avoidable utilization of the healthcare system, we are able to reduce our claims expenditures in some of our largest medical expense categories, which translates to superior medical benefits ratio MBR financial performance and ultimately the ability to offer richer products in the market. 
 Achieve Superior Unit Economics: As our senior population ages, their healthcare needs become more frequent and complex. To combat the healthcare cost increases that typically result, we proactively look to (i) connect with our population early in their enrollment with Alignment to assess their care needs, (ii) develop care plans and engage those members with more chronic, complex health challenges in our clinical model, and (iii) continue to monitor and evaluate our healthier members in a preventative fashion over time. Given the Medicare Advantage payment mechanism and the retention of the vast majority of our members who continue to choose Alignment after their initial selection year, we are able to focus our efforts on driving favorable long-term health outcomes for our entire population. As a result, our clinical 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 model efforts have demonstrated the ability to lower the MBRs of our returning members. We believe this is evidence of our ability to manage the financial risk of our members as they age, and that these favorable underlying unit economic trends translate directly to our ability to continue to deliver a richer product to the marketplace. With this dynamic in mind, our consolidated MBR may be impacted year-to-year based on our pace of new member growth and mix of members by cohort. However, we believe our ability to sustain MBR performance improvement over time positions us well to invest in new member growth to drive long-term financial performance. 
 Invest in our Platform and Growth: We plan to continue to invest in our business in order to further develop our AVA platform, pursue new expansion opportunities and create innovative product offerings. In addition, in order to maintain a differentiated value proposition for our members, we continue to invest in innovative product offerings and supplementary benefits to meet the evolving needs of the senior consumer. We anticipate further investments in our business as we expand into new markets and pursue strategic acquisitions, which we expect will primarily be focused on healthcare delivery groups in key geographies, standalone and provider-sponsored Medicare Advantage plans and other complementary risk bearing assets. 
 Navigate Seasonality to our Business: Our operational and financial results will experience some variability depending upon the time of year in which they are measured. We experience the largest portion of member growth during the first quarter, when plan enrollment selections made during the annual enrollment period ("AEP") from October 15th through December 7th of the prior year take effect. As a result, we expect to see a majority of our member growth occur on January 1 of a given calendar year. As the year progresses, our per-member revenue often declines as new members join us, typically with less complete or accurate documentation (and therefore lower risk-adjustment scores), and senior mortality disproportionately impacts our higher-acuity (and therefore greater revenue) members. Medical costs will vary seasonally depending on a number of factors, but most significantly the weather. Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which will result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We therefore expect to see higher levels of per-member medical costs in the first and fourth quarters. The design of our prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D) results in coverage that varies as a member s cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member s plan period, which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages of the year and less in the latter stages, which typically results in a higher MBR on our Part D program in the first half of the year relative to the second half of the year. In addition, we expect our corporate, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth and because of additional costs of being a public company. Due to the timing of many of these investments, including our primary sales and marketing season, we typically incur a greater level of investment in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year.

 (1) See "Adjusted EBITDA" and "Adjusted Gross Profit" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures. 
 Health Plan Membership 
 We define Health Plan Membership as the number of members enrolled in our HMO and PPO contracts as of the end of a reporting period. We believe this is an important metric to assess growth of our underlying business, which is indicative of our ability to consistently offer a superior value proposition to seniors. This metric excludes third party payor members with respect to which we are at-risk for managing their healthcare expenditures, which represented 400 members as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. It also excludes the approximately 8,500 and 7,400 ACO REACH members as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Medical Benefits Ratio 
 Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as loss from operations before depreciation and amortization, clinical equity-based compensation expense, clinical restructuring costs and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Adjusted gross profit is a key measure used by our management and Board to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends before the impact of our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Adjusted gross profit should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of adjusted gross profit in lieu of loss from operations, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Our use of the term adjusted gross profit may vary from the use of similar terms by other companies in our industry and accordingly may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

 (1) Represents severance and related costs incurred as part of a corporate restructuring designed to streamline our organizational structure and drive operational efficiencies. 
 (2) Includes 0.6 million in impairment expense related to intangible assets that were written off during the quarter. 
 We calculate our MBR by dividing total medical expenses, excluding depreciation, equity-based compensation and clinical restructuring costs, by total revenues in a given period. We believe our MBR is an indicator of our gross profit for our Medicare Advantage plans and demonstrates the ability of our clinical model to produce superior outcomes by identifying and providing targeted care to our high-risk members resulting in improved member health and reduced total population medical expenses. We expect that this metric may fluctuate over time due to a variety of factors, including our pace of new member growth given that new members typically join Alignment with higher MBRs, while our model has demonstrated an ability to improve MBR for a given cohort over time. 
 When we determine, on an annual basis, whether we have satisfied the CMS minimum Medical Loss Ratio of 85 , adjustments are made to the MBR calculation to include certain additional expenses related to improving the quality of care provided, and to exclude certain taxes and fees, in each case as permitted or required by CMS and applicable regulatory requirements. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition expenses, certain litigation costs, gains or losses on right of use ("ROU") assets, gains or losses on sale of property and equipment, restructuring costs and equity-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management and our Board to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operating plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA provides useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as we do not consider the excluded items to be part of our ongoing results of operations. Given our intent to continue to invest in our platform and the scalability of our business in the short to medium-term, we believe Adjusted EBITDA over the long term will be an important indicator of value creation. 
 Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA in lieu of net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similar terms by other companies in our industry and accordingly may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

 Earned Premiums. Earned premium revenues were 684.5 million and 450.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 234.3 million or 52.0 . Earned premium revenues were 1,980.1 million and 1,341.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 638.2 million or 47.6 . The increase was primarily driven by growth in our Health Plan membership, which increased 57.7 between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. The increase was offset by a decrease in ACO REACH

 revenue due to the change from gross to net revenue treatment. ACO REACH revenue decreased 30.8 million, or 101.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased 94.0 million, or 101.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Revenue. Other revenue increased 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 22.6 . Other revenue increased 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 35.9 . The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the interest rate of our interest earning cash balances and the change in gross to net revenue treatment for ACO REACH. 
 Expenses 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 
 2024 2023 
 (dollars in thousands) Expenses: Medical expenses 613,444 397,879 215,565 54.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 90,871 83,089 7,782 9.4 Depreciation and amortization 7,640 5,497 2,143 39.0 Total expenses 711,955 486,465 225,490 46.4

 2024 2023 
 (dollars in thousands) Expenses: Medical expenses 1,791,974 1,204,838 587,136 48.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 269,246 223,696 45,550 20.4 Depreciation and amortization 20,110 15,613 4,497 28.8 Total expenses 2,081,330 1,444,147 637,183 44.1 
 
 Medical Expenses. Medical expenses were 613.4 million and 397.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 215.6 million, or 54.2 . Medical expenses were 1,792.0 million and 1,204.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 587.1 million, or 48.7 . The increase was driven primarily by the growth in Alignment s Health Plan membership, which increased 57.7 between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Overall, medical expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 grew at a slightly higher rate than earned premium revenues compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 2024 having a higher percentage of new members relative to returning members, richer member benefits and increases in unit costs, offset by lower inpatient admissions per thousand and the change in ACO REACH accounting. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 90.9 million and 83.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 7.8 million, or 9.4 . Selling, general and administrative expenses were 269.2 million and 223.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 45.6 million, or 20.4 .The increase was primarily due to an increase in ongoing investments and expenditures in network development, operations and sales and marketing to drive the growth of Alignment's Health Plan membership. Selling, general, and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to economies of scale gained from Alignment's 2024 membership growth. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was 7.6 million and 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 2.1 million, or 39.0 . Depreciation and amortization expense was 20.1 million and 15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 respectively, an increase of 4.5 million, or 28.8 . The increase was primarily due to the amount and timing of our capital expenditures and the associated depreciation relative to 2023 . Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded amortization expense of 0.6 million related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with an inactive medicare license that was terminated during the period. 
 Other Expenses 
 Interest expense. Interest expense was 6.9 million and 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 1.4 million or 25.5 . Interest expense was 18.1 million and 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 2.3 million or 14.7 . The increase in interest expense was partially due to an increase in the debt balance as a result of the 50.0 million draw down of the Oxford Delayed Draw term loan in June 2024. Additionally, we experienced a higher interest rate on our debt balance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average interest rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11.77 and 11.74 , respectively. The average interest rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11.77 and 11.35 , respectively. 
 Other income, net . Other income was (0.02) million and (0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 0.1 million or (80.0) . Other income was (0.1) million and (0.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 0.6 million or (85.7) . The decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of gains and losses related to ROU assets subleased during the respective periods. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 To date, we have financed our operations principally through our IPO, private placements of our equity securities, revenues, and certain term loans (described below). As of September 30, 2024, we had 381.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 We operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Alignment Healthcare, Inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, our operating parent company (an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of our parent company) had 104.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 We may incur operating losses in the future due to the investments we intend to continue to make in expanding our operations and sales and marketing, in further developing our technology and due to the general and administrative costs we expect to incur in connection with continuing to operate as a public company. As a result, we may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business. 
 We believe that our liquid assets will be sufficient to fund our operating and organic capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary because of, and our future capital requirements will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to expand our presence in existing markets, expand into new markets, increase our sales and marketing activities and develop our technology. Additionally, in the future we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights, which may also increase our capital needs. 
 We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.

 Certain states in which we operate as a CMS-licensed Medicare Advantage company may require us to meet certain capital adequacy performance standards and tests. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has adopted rules which, if implemented by the states, set minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies, HMOs, and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. The requirements take the form of risk-based capital RBC rules, which may vary from state to state. Certain states in which our health plans or risk bearing entities operate have adopted the RBC rules. Other states in which our health plans or risk bearing entities operate have chosen not to adopt the RBC rules, but instead have designed and implemented their own rules regarding capital adequacy. As of September 30, 2024, our health plans or risk-bearing entities were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements. 
 Oxford Term Loan 
 On September 2, 2022 (the Effective Date ), we, Alignment Healthcare USA, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company (the Borrower and certain of our other subsidiaries (together with the Company and the Borrower, the Borrower Parties entered into a term loan agreement (the Oxford Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC Oxford ), as administrative agent, collateral agent and a lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the Lenders ), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed to lend the Borrower an aggregate principal amount of up to 250.0 million in a series of term loans (the Term Loans ). Pursuant to the Oxford Loan Agreement, the Borrower received an initial Term Loan of 165.0 million on the Effective Date and had the option to borrow up to an additional 85.0 million of Term Loans (such additional Term Loans, the Delayed Draw Term Loans ). On June 14, 2024, the Borrower borrowed 50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Delayed Draw Term Loans, prior to the expiration date for such amount of the Delayed Draw Term Loans of June 30, 2024, to avoid losing access to the capital, to enhance the Company's balance sheet and to provide for future flexibility. As of September 30, 2024 we had the option to borrow an additional 35.0 million in undrawn Delayed Draw Term Loans, which option expires on September 1, 2025. 
 Interest on the Term Loans is a variable rate equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a one-month tenor, subject to a floor of 1.00 , plus (ii) an applicable margin of 6.50 . Beginning January 1, 2025, principal payments of 0.5 million, 0.25 of the gross principal amount borrowed, are due on a quarterly basis. All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to each Term Loan is due and payable in full on September 1, 2027. The interest rate applied during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ranged from 11.70 to 11.85 . 
 The Term Loans are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and collateralized by all unrestricted assets. 
 The Oxford Loan Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, judgment defaults, insolvency and bankruptcy defaults, and change of control. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Oxford Loan Agreement, termination of the Term Loan commitments and the right to foreclose on the collateral securing the obligations. During the existence of an event of default, the outstanding Term Loans will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 2.00 plus the otherwise applicable interest rate. Additionally, in the event of any contemplated asset sale or series of asset sales yielding net proceeds in excess of 2.5 million, except those excluded per the Oxford Loan Agreement, we are required to prepay the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans in an amount equal to the entire amount of the asset sale net proceeds, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 
 The Oxford Loan Agreement includes financial covenants that require the Borrower Parties to (i) maintain minimum liquidity, as defined in the Loan Agreement, of 23.0 million and (ii) satisfy a maximum permitted ratio of debt to trailing twelve-month revenue, as set forth in the Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants.

 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 43,481 128,279 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 45,111 (146,245) Net cash provided by financing activities 49,153 60 Net change in cash 137,745 (17,906) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 204,954 411,299 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 342,699 393,393 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 43.5 million, a decrease of 84.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 128.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is mainly attributable to the timing of our monthly premium revenue payments from CMS. We typically receive our monthly premium payments from CMS on the first day of the month. However, as the first day of October 2023 did not occur on a business day, we received the October 2023 premium payments on the last day of September 2023. At September 30, 2023 we recorded deferred premium revenue of 146.0 million. Excluding deferred premium revenue, net cash provided by operating activities increased 61.4 million, mainly attributable to an increase in medical expenses payable as a result of the increased Health Plan membership growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 45.1 million, an increase of 191.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 146.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily relates to increased purchases of short-term treasury securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 49.2 million, an increase of 49.1 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 0.06 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities is mainly attributable to the 50.0 million draw down of the Oxford Delayed Draw term loan that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our Annual Report.

 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in inflation. We do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates through our term loan agreement. This agreement exposes us to variability in interest payments due to changes in SOFR interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Based on our analysis of the periods presented, we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operating results. There can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes to our Internal Controls over Financial Reporting: 
 There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
