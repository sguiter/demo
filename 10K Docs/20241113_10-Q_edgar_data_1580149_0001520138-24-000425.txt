 Notes to Condensed Financial Statements 

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and
2023 

 (unaudited) 

Long COVID Program 

In April 2024, the Company announced the grant of
a clinical trial award of up to 13.1 million from the U.S. Department of Defense DOD ), awarded through the Peer Reviewed
Medical Research Program of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs. In August 2024, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development
Command, Office of Human Research Oversight OHRO approved the Company s plan to evaluate bezisterim (NE3107) for
the treatment of neurological symptoms that are associated with long COVID. and the FDA authorized our Investigational New Drug IND application for bezisterim (NE3107) allowing us to study a novel, anti-inflammatory approach or the treatment of the debilitating neurocognitive
symptoms associated with long covid. The Company anticipates the trial to commence by early 2025. The Company has been reimbursed approximately
 325,000 for the trial during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liver Disease Program 

In liver disease, our investigational drug candidate
BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), which has been granted both FDA Fast Track designation status and FDA Orphan Drug status, is
being evaluated and discussed after receiving guidance from the FDA regarding the design of Phase 3 clinical testing of BIV201 for the
treatment of ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis. BIV201 is administered as a patent-pending liquid formulation. 

In June 2021, the Company initiated a Phase 2 study
(NCT04112199) designed to evaluate the efficacy of BIV201 (terlipressin, administered by continuous infusion for two 28-day treatment
cycles) combined with standard-of-care SOC ), compared to SOC alone, for the treatment of refractory ascites. The primary
endpoints of the study are the incidence of ascites-related complications and change in ascites fluid accumulation during treatment compared
to a pre-treatment period. 

In March 2023, the Company announced enrollment was
paused and that data from the first 15 patients treated with BIV201 plus SOC appeared to show at least a 30 reduction in ascites fluid
during the 28 days after treatment initiation compared to the 28 days prior to treatment. The change in ascites volume was significantly
different from those patients receiving SOC treatment. Patients who completed the treatment with BIV201 experienced a 53 reduction in
ascites fluid, which was sustained (43 reduction) during the three months after treatment initiation as compared to the three-month pre-treatment
period. 

In June 2023, the Company requested and subsequently
received guidance from the FDA regarding the design and endpoints for definitive clinical testing of BIV201 for the treatment of ascites
due to chronic liver cirrhosis. The Company is currently finalizing protocol designs for the Phase 3 study of BIV201 for the treatment
of ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis. 

The BIV201 development program was initiated by LAT
Pharma LLC. On April 11, 2016, the Company acquired LAT Pharma LLC and the rights to its BIV201 development program. The Company currently
owns all development and marketing rights to this drug candidate. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on April 11,
2016, between our predecessor entities, LAT Pharma LLC and NanoAntibiotics, Inc., BioVie is obligated to pay a low single digit royalty
on net sales of BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin) to be shared among LAT Pharma Members, PharmaIn Corporation, and The Barrett
Edge, Inc. 

 million, cash and cash equivalents of approximately
 million, stockholders equity of approximately million, and an accumulated deficit of approximately million.
The Company is in the pre-revenue stage and no revenues are expected in the foreseeable future. The Company s future operations
are dependent on the success of the Company s ongoing development and commercialization efforts, as well as its ability to secure
additional financing as needed. Projected cash flows could be extended if further measures are taken to delay planned expenditures on
our research protocols and slow the progress in the Company s development and launch of next phase clinical programs. 

The future viability of the Company is largely dependent
upon its ability to raise additional capital to finance its operations. Management expects that future sources of funding may include
sales of equity, obtaining loans, or other strategic transactions. 

Although management continues to pursue the Company s
strategic plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on terms acceptable to the
Company, if at all, to fund continuing operations. These circumstances raise substantial doubt on the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

includes the weighted average effect of the pre-funded warrants issued in connection with the September
2024 Offering, the exercise of which requires nominal consideration for the delivery of the shares of common stock (see Note 8). 

The table below shows the potential shares of common
stock, presented based on amounts outstanding at each year end, which were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share
attributable to common stockholders because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

Amortization expense was in each of the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company amortizes intellectual property over the expected original useful lives of years. 

Estimated future amortization expense is as follows: 

2026 

shares of the Company s Common
Stock, at a price of 16.50 per share (the PIPE Shares ), and (ii) a warrant to purchase 727,273 shares of Common Stock PIPE
Warrant Shares ), at an exercise price of 18.20, with a term of exercise of five years. The down round feature reduced the exercise
price of the PIPE Warrant Shares to 10.00 per share on March 6, 2024 and again to 1.53 per share on September 25, 2024 in connection
with the offering further described in Note 8 as the Company sold stock at a price lower than its initial exercise price. The Company
calculated the difference in fair value of the PIPE Warrant Shares between the stated exercise price and the reduced exercise price and
recorded as a deemed dividend in the accompanying condesnsed statement of changes in stockholders equity. The fair value
of the PIPE Warrant Shares were estimated using the Black Scholes Method with the following inputs, the stock price of , exercise
price of and , remaining term of years, risk free rate of and volatility of . 

plus the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal and (b) 10.75 .
The prime rate on September 30, 2024, was . The Loan is secured by a lien upon and security interest in all of the Company s
assets, including intellectual property, subject to agreed exceptions. The maturity date of the Loan is December 1, 2024. 

The Loan Agreement required monthly interest-only
payments during the first eighteen months of the term of the Loan. Following the interest-only period, on July 1, 2023, the Company pays
equal monthly payments of principal, plus accrued interest, until the Loan s maturity date when all remaining principal and accrued
interest is due. If the Company prepays the Loan, it will be required to pay (a) a prepayment fee in an amount equal to 3.0 of the principal
amount of the Loan that is prepaid during the interest-only period; and (b) a prepayment fee in an amount equal to 1.0 of the principal
amount of the Loan that is prepaid after the interest-only period. At the Loan s maturity date, or on the date of the prepayment
of the Loan, the Company will be obligated to pay a final payment equal to 4.25 of the Loan commitment amount, the sum of Tranche 1 and
Tranche 2, which amounts to 850,000 (the Loan Premium ). 

The Loan Agreement includes a conversion option to
convert up to 5.0 million of the principal amount of the Loan outstanding at the option of Avenue, into shares of the Company s
Common Stock at a conversion price of 69.80 per share (the Conversion Option ). 

On the Closing Date, the Company issued to Avenue
warrants to purchase 36,101 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the Avenue Warrants at an exercise price per share equal
to 58.20. The Avenue Warrants are exercisable until November 30, 2026. 

The amount of the carrying value of the notes payable
was determined by allocating portions of the outstanding principal of the notes, approximately million, to the fair value of the
Avenue Warrants, and approximately million to the fair value of the embedded Conversion Option. Accordingly, the total amount of
unearned discount of approximately 3.6 million, the total direct financing cost of approximately and the Loan Premium of 
are being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the Loan. The adjusted effective interest rate is 24 . 

Total interest expense associated with this loan was approximately , which is reflected as a component of interest expense on the accompanying
condensed statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense associated with
this loan was comprised of interest incurred on the outstanding principal of the loan of approximately , amortization of financing
costs of approximately , amortization of the unearned discount of , and the accretion of the Loan Premium of approximately
 . 

Total interest expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 was approximately million on the accompanying condensed statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Interest
expense was comprised of interest incurred on the outstanding principal of the loan of approximately , amortization of financing
costs of approximately , amortization of the unearned discount of approximately and the accretion of Loan Premium of approximately
 . 

As of September 30, 2024, the remaining principal
balance of million under the Loan is payable in 3 monthly equal installments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company paid back million of the original loan of million.

 Balance at September 30, 2023 

The fair values of derivative liabilities for the
Avenue Warrants and Conversion Option at September 30, 2024, in the accompanying condensed balance sheets, were approximately 1,300 and
approximately zero, respectively. The total change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities totaled approximately 2,500 and 708,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and accordingly, was recorded in the accompanying condensed statements
of operations and comprehensive loss. The assumptions used in the Black Scholes model to value the derivative liabilities at September
30, 2024 included the closing stock price of per share; for the Avenue Warrants, the exercise price of , remaining term 
year, risk free rate of and volatility of ; and for the Conversion Option, the conversion price of ; remaining term of
 months, risk free rate of and volatility of . 

Derivative liability Avenue Warrants 

The Avenue Warrants were not considered to be indexed
to the Company s own stock, and accordingly, were recorded as a derivative liability at fair value in the accompanying condensed
balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 

The Black Scholes model was used to calculate the
fair value of the derivative warrant to bifurcate the amount from the Avenue Loan amount funded. The Avenue Warrants are recorded at their
fair values at the date of issuance and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period end date. 

Embedded derivative liability Conversion
Option 

The Conversion Option is accounted for as an embedded
derivative liability and required bifurcation from the Loan amount. The Black Scholes model was used to calculate the fair value of the

condition and the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere
in this report. 

Management s Discussion 

BioVie Inc. (the Company or we 
or our is a clinical-stage company developing innovative drug therapies to treat chronic debilitating conditions including
neurological and neuro-degenerative disorders and liver disease. 

Neurodegenerative Disease Program 

The Company acquired the biopharmaceutical assets
of NeurMedix, Inc. NeurMedix a privately held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company and a related party in June 2021 . 
The acquired assets included NE3107. In April 2024, the Company announced that the United States Adopted Names Council, and the World
Health Organization International Nonproprietary Names expert committee had approved bezisterim as the non-proprietary (generic)
name for NE3107. Bezisterim (NE3107) is an investigational, novel, orally administered small molecule that is thought to inhibit inflammation-driven
insulin resistance and major pathological inflammatory cascades with a novel mechanism of action. There is emerging scientific consensus
that both inflammation and insulin resistance may play fundamental roles in the development of AD and PD, and bezisterim (NE3107) could,
if approved by FDA, represent an entirely new medical approach to treating these devastating conditions affecting an estimated 6 million
Americans suffering from AD and 1 million Americans suffering from PD. 

In neurodegenerative disease, bezisterim (NE3107)
inhibits activation of inflammatory ERK and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells NF B (including interactions with TNF signaling and other relevant inflammatory pathways) that lead to neuroinflammation and insulin resistance.
Bezisterim (NE3107) does not interfere with their homeostatic functions (e.g., insulin signaling and neuron growth and survival). Both
inflammation and insulin resistance are drivers of AD and PD. 

Chronic neuroinflammation, insulin resistance, and
oxidative stress are common features in the major neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, frontotemporal lobar dementia, and Amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis. Bezisterim (NE3107) is an investigational oral small molecule, blood-brain permeable, compound with potential anti-inflammatory,
insulin sensitizing, and ERK-binding properties that may allow it to selectively inhibit ERK-, NF B- and TNF-stimulated inflammation.
Bezisterim s (NE3107) potential to inhibit neuroinflammation and insulin resistance forms the basis for the Company s work
testing the molecule in AD, PD, and long COVID patients. Bezisterim (NE3107) is patented in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe
and South Korea. 

Parkinson s Disease 

Parkinson s disease PD is driven
in large part by neuroinflammation and activation of brain microglia, leading to increased proinflammatory cytokines (particularly TNF).
Multiple daily administrations of levodopa (converted to dopamine in the brain) is the current standard of care treatment for this movement
disorder. However, levodopa effectiveness diminishes over time necessitating increased dosage and prolonged daily administration leads
to side effects of uncontrolled movements called levodopa-induced dyskinesia, commonly referred to as LID, which is exacerbated by high
dose levodopa. Although levodopa provides symptomatic benefit, it does not slow PD progression. 

23 

 Table of Contents 

The Phase 2 study of bezisterim (NE3107) for the treatment
of PD (NCT05083260), completed in December 2022, was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics study
in PD participants treated with carbidopa/levodopa and bezisterim (NE3107). Forty-five patients with a defined L-dopa off state 
were randomized 1:1 to placebo: bezisterim (NE3107) 20 mg twice daily for 28 days. This trial was launched with two design objectives:
1) the primary objective was safety and a drug-drug interaction study as requested by the FDA to measure the potential for adverse interactions
of bezisterim (NE3107) with carbidopa/ levodopa; and 2) the secondary objective was to determine if preclinical indications of promotoric
activity and apparent enhancement of levodopa activity could be seen in humans. Both objectives were met. 

To extend this Phase 2 data in progressed patients,
the Company has designed a new Phase 2 study of bezisterim (NE3107) as a potential first line therapy to treat patients with new onset
PD. In August 2024, the FDA authorized the protocol for this new study. 

Long COVID Program 

In April 2024, the Company announced the grant of
a clinical trial award of up to 13.1 million from the U.S. Department of Defense DOD ), awarded through the Peer Reviewed
Medical Research Program of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs. In August 2024, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development
Command, Office of Human Research Oversight OHRO approved the Company s plan to evaluate bezisterim (NE3107) for
the treatment of neurological symptoms that are associated with long COVID. and the FDA authorized our Investigational New Drug IND application for bezisterim (NE3107) allowing us to study a novel, anti-inflammatory approach or the treatment of the debilitating neurocognitive
symptoms associated with long covid. The Company anticipates the trial to commence by early 2025. 

Liver Disease Program 

In liver disease, our investigational drug candidate
BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), which has been granted both FDA Fast Track designation status and FDA Orphan Drug status, is
being evaluated and discussed after receiving guidance from the FDA regarding the design of Phase 3 clinical testing of BIV201 for the
treatment of ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis. BIV201 is administered as a patent-pending liquid formulation. 

In June 2021, the Company initiated a Phase 2 study
(NCT04112199) designed to evaluate the efficacy of BIV201 (terlipressin, administered by continuous infusion for two 28-day treatment
cycles) combined with standard-of-care SOC ), compared to SOC alone, for the treatment of refractory ascites. The primary
endpoints of the study are the incidence of ascites-related complications and change in ascites fluid accumulation during treatment compared
to a pre-treatment period. 

In March 2023, the Company announced enrollment was
paused and that data from the first 15 patients treated with BIV201 plus SOC appeared to show at least a 30 reduction in ascites fluid
during the 28 days after treatment initiation compared to the 28 days prior to treatment. The change in ascites volume was significantly
different from those patients receiving SOC treatment. Patients who completed the treatment with BIV201 experienced a 53 reduction in
ascites fluid, which was sustained (43 reduction) during the three months after treatment initiation as compared to the three-month pre-treatment
period. 

In June 2023, the Company requested and subsequently
received guidance from the FDA regarding the design and endpoints for definitive clinical testing of BIV201 for the treatment of ascites
due to chronic liver cirrhosis. The Company is currently finalizing protocol designs for the Phase 3 study of BIV201 for the treatment
of ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis. 

While the active agent, terlipressin, is approved
in the U.S. and in about 40 countries for related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis, treatment of ascites is not included in these
authorizations. Patients with refractory ascites suffer from frequent life-threatening complications, generate more than 5 billion in
annual treatment costs, and have an estimated 50 mortality rate within 6 to 12 months. The FDA has not approved any drug to treat refractory
ascites.

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three
months ended September 30, 2023 

Net loss 

The
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 4.2 million and as compared to the net loss of 10.7 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease of 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised
of a decrease in research and development expenses of 6.9 million, offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses
of approximately 132,000 and a decrease in other (expense) income, net of approximately 195,000. 

Total
operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 4.1 million as compared to 10.9 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease of approximately 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
was comprised of decreased research and development expenses of approximately 6.9 million primarily due to the completion of clinical
trials in the prior fiscal year, offset by a net increase in selling general and administrative expenses of approximately 132,000, primarily
attributed to increased legal expenses related to regulatory, patent filings and litigation related to the class action suit. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development R D expenses were approximately 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decline
of approximately 6.9 million from 8.9 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease in R D expenses of approximately
 6.9 million is primarily attributed to the completion of clinical trials in the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, causing decreased
clinical trials expenses of 5.2 million, a decline in the clinical team expense consisting of reductions in clinical team payroll of
approximately 915,000, reduction in the use of consultants of approximately 547,000, a reduction in the use of regulatory and other
consultants totaling approximately 274,000, and a decrease in other related expenses of approximately 126,000 in travel, conferences
and publications. This was offset by increased expenses in Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls CMC totaling approximately
 155,000 related to drug production and drug discovery development. 

The decline in clinical studies of 5.2 million represented
the net decrease in clinical trial studies expense due the completion of the clinical trials in fiscal year 2024 offset by the planning
and development of the two new clinical studies PD and LC. The table below summarizes the expense amounts for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 by study:

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were
approximately 2.1 million and 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net decrease of
approximately 132,000 was primarily attributed to the increases in legal fee expenses of approximately 400,000 and insurance premiums
of approximately 29,000; offset by declines in the executive teams compensation of approximately 188,000, investor relations and other
filing fees of approximately 49,000, and other professional and consulting fees of approximately 52,000. 

Other Income and Expense 

Other expense, net was approximately 30,000 compared
to other income, net of 165,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net increase in other expense
of approximately 195,000 is comprised of a reduction in the change in fair value of the related derivative liabilities of approximately
 705,000 and a reduction in interest expense of approximately 749,000, offset by a reduction in interest income of approximately 239,000.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working
capital of approximately 13.3 million, cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately 20.0 million, stockholders equity of
approximately 14.1 million, and an accumulated deficit of approximately 338.7 million. 

The Company used net cash in operations totaling approximately
 3.6 million and net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 241,000 comprised of net proceeds from capital raise activities
of 2.3 million offset by the payment of 2.5 million of the Company s notes payable. 

The Company has not generated any revenue and no revenues
are expected in the foreseeable future. The Company s future operations are dependent on the success of the Company s ongoing
development and commercialization efforts, as well as its ability to secure additional financing. Management expects that future
sources of funding may include sales of equity, obtaining loans, or other strategic transactions. 

Although management continues to pursue the Company s
strategic plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on terms acceptable to the
Company, if at all, to fund continuing operations. These circumstances raise substantial doubt on the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

that the defendants made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact relating to the Company s business, operations,
compliance, and prospects, including information related to the NM101 Phase 3 study and trial of bezisterim (NE3107) in mild to moderate
probable AD, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The class action is
on behalf of purchasers of the Company s securities during the period from December 7, 2022 through November 28, 2023 and seeks
unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney s fees. The
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on August 21, 2024, and plaintiffs filed their opposition on October 21, 2024.
The defendants reply brief is due December 5, 2024. The defendants believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend
vigorously against them, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Except as described below, there have been no material
changes to the Risk Factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-K. The risks described in our Form 10-K and below are not the only risks
facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. 

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry 

We rely and will continue to rely on third parties
to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines
or do not successfully perform and comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize
our product candidates. 

We depend, and will continue to depend, on third
parties, including, but not limited to, contract research organizations CROs ), clinical trial sites and clinical trial
principal investigators, contract laboratories, IRBs, manufacturers, suppliers, and other third parties to conduct our clinical trials,
including those for our drug candidates bezisterim (NE3107) and BIV201. We rely heavily on these third parties over the course of our
clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we retain ultimate responsibility for ensuring
that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the protocol and applicable legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and
regulations, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are
required to comply with cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities
for the conduct of clinical trials on product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce cGCPs through periodic
inspections and for-cause inspections of clinical trial principal investigators and trial sites. If, due to the failure of either the
Company or a third party, a clinical trial fails to comply with applicable cGCPs, FDA s IND requirements, other applicable regulatory
requirements, or requirements set forth in the applicable IRB-approved protocol, the Company may be required to conduct additional clinical
trials to support our marketing applications, which would delay the regulatory approval process. For example, our drug product candidate
bezisterim (NE3107) was cleared by FDA for use in a Phase 3, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter
study in subjects who have mild to moderate AD. Enrollment in that trial began in August 2021, with a planned primary completion in late
2022/early 2023. On November 29, 2023, the Company announced topline efficacy data from its Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04669028) of bezisterim
(NE3107) in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. Upon trial completion, as the Company began the process of analyzing the trial data,
the Company found significant deviations from the protocol and cGCP violations at 15 study sites (virtually all of which were from one
geographic area). This highly unusual level of suspected improprieties led the Company to exclude all patients from these sites. We subsequently
notified FDA s OSI of such significant deviations from study protocol, the suspected improprieties, and the study sites involved.
The identification of significant deviations from study protocol and numerous GCP violations at multiple study sites raised questions
regarding the validity and robustness of data from these study sites. The unplanned exclusion of so many patients left the trial underpowered
for its primary endpoints. However, based on the remaining dataset from those other sites determined to be in compliance with the protocol
and GCP s, a preliminary signal of efficacy was detected. The Company is considering: (1) employing the adaptive trial feature
of the protocol to continue enrolling patients to achieve statistical significance; and/or (2) designing a new Phase 3 study of bezisterim
(NE3107) that leverages the most recent scientific literature relating to AD along with the company's understanding regarding the effects
of bezisterim (NE3107) in persons with mild-moderate AD.

 Table of Contents 

Although we design the clinical trials for our product
candidates, our CROs are tasked with facilitating and monitoring these trials. As a result, many aspects of our clinical development
programs, including site and investigator selection, and the conduct, timing, and monitoring of the study, is outside our direct control,
either partially or in whole. Our reliance on third parties to conduct clinical trials also results in less direct control over the collection,
management, and quality of data developed through clinical trials than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own employees.
Communicating with third parties can also be challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities.
Our business may be impacted if any of these third parties violates applicable federal, state, or foreign laws and/or regulations, including
but not limited to FDA s IND regulations, cGCPs, fraud and abuse or false claims laws, healthcare privacy and data security laws,
or provide us or government agencies with inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data. 

Adverse Developments Affecting the Financial
Services Industry and Concentration of Risk 

As of September 30, 2024,
the Company had cash deposited in a certain financial institution in excess of federally insured levels. The Company regularly monitors
the financial stability of the financial institution and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash
equivalents. Bank failures, events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance, or other adverse developments that affect financial
institutions, or concerns or rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. In 2023, certain U.S. government banking regulators
took steps to intervene in the operations of certain financial institutions due to liquidity concerns, which caused general heightened
uncertainties in financial markets. While previous bank failures have not had a material direct impact on the Company s operations,
if further liquidity and financial stability concerns arise with respect to banks and financial institutions, either nationally or in
specific regions, the Company s ability to access cash or enter into new financing arrangements may be threatened, which could have
a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Relating To Our Common Stock 

You may experience future dilution as a result
of future equity offerings or if we issue shares subject to options, warrants, stock awards or other arrangements. 

As of September 30, 2024, our Articles of Incorporation,
as amended, authorize the issuance of 800,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and we had 7,982,986 shares of Common Stock issued and 7,956,660
issued and outstanding. Accordingly, we may issue up to an additional 792,043,340 shares of Common Stock. The future issuance of Common
Stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our Common Stock held by our then existing stockholders. We may value any
Common Stock in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of Common Stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate
actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, might have an adverse effect on any trading market
for our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital in the future through the sale of equity securities. 

In order to raise additional capital, we may in the
future offer additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock. We may sell
shares or other securities in offerings at a price per share that is less than the current market price of our securities, and investors
purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The sale of additional shares
of our Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock would dilute all of our stockholders, and
if such sales of convertible securities into or exchangeable into our Common Stock occur at a deemed issuance price that is lower than
the current exercise price of our outstanding warrants sold to Acuitas Group Holdings, LLC Acuitas in August 2022, the
exercise price for those warrants would adjust downward to the deemed issuance price pursuant to price adjustment protection contained
within those warrants. 

As of September 30, 2024, there were warrants outstanding
to purchase an aggregate of 4,316,002 shares of our Common Stock at exercise prices ranging from 1.53 to 125.00 per share and 517,996
shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options at exercise prices ranging from 4.70 to 420.90 per share and restricted stock units
totaling 34,566. In addition, pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement and the Supplement to the Loan and Security Agreement, each
entered into on November 30, 2021, with Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P. and Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P., the lenders
have the option to convert up to 5 million of the outstanding loan amount into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of 69.80
per share. We may also grant additional options, warrants or equity awards. To the extent such shares are issued, the interest of holders
of our Common Stock will be diluted. 

Moreover, we are obligated to issue shares of our
Common Stock upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to certain of our drug candidates
(i.e., bezisterim (NE3107), NE3291, NE3413, and NE3789) pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, dated April 27, 2021, by and among the
Company, NeurMedix and Acuitas, as amended on May 9, 2021. The achievement of these milestones could result in the issuance of up to 1.8
million shares of our Common Stock, further diluting the interest of holders of our Common Stock.

Item 2. Unregistered sales of equity securities 

On August 12, 2024,
the Company issued 15,000 shares of Common Stock to a vendor as part of their fees in exchange for services. The fair value of the Common
Stock at the date of issuance was 2.23 per share. The stock-based compensation expense related to this Common Stock issuance was 33,450. 

The offers, sales, and issuances of the securities
described above were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act
and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering, as applicable. The recipients
of securities in each of these transactions acquired the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection
with any distribution thereof and appropriate legends were affixed to the securities issued in these transactions. Each of the recipients
of securities in these transactions was an accredited or sophisticated person and had adequate access, through employment, business or
other relationships, to information about us. 

Other than equity
securities issued in transactions disclosed above and on our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 22, 2024, October
24, 2024 and October 29, 2024, there were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the period.
