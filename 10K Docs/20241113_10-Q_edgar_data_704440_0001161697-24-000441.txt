We evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine if
they are more likely than not to be realized by assessing both positive and negative evidence in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income
Taxes. After considering our cumulative pretax loss (the three-year period ending with the current year), as well as analyzing all
available evidence, we recorded a valuation allowance of against our net deferred tax assets during the year ended
December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the valuation allowance is . As we continue to assess the realizability of our
deferred tax assets, reported pretax income and new evidence may result in a partial or full reduction of the valuation allowance in future
periods.

PART I ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains, and our
officers and representatives may from time to time make, certain forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of the management,
as well as assumptions made and information currently available. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances
of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business,
future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking
statements relate to the future, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and
many of which are outside of our control. 

Our actual results may vary materially from the forward-looking
statements made in this report due to important factors such as uncertainties associated with global health crises, inflation, war and
other geopolitical conflicts, customer ordering patterns, availability and costs of raw materials and labor and our ability to recover
such costs, future operating results, growth of new patient starts and the Ig market, our compliance with Food and Drug Administration
and foreign authority regulations and the outcome of regulatory audits, introduction of competitive products, acceptance of and demand
for new and existing products, ability to penetrate new markets, success in enforcing and obtaining patents, reimbursement related risks,
government regulation of the home health care industry, success of our research and development effort, expanding the market of FREEDOM TM 
System demand in the SCIg market, availability of sufficient capital if or when needed, dependence on key personnel, and the impact of
recent accounting pronouncements, as well as those risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023. When used in this report, the words estimate, project, believe, may, 
 will, anticipate, intend, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements, which include, without limitation, statements regarding need for additional financing. Such statements
reflect current views with respect to future events based on currently available information and are subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company does not undertake
any obligation to release publicly any revision to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

OVERVIEW 

The Company develops, manufactures and markets proprietary
portable and innovative medical devices primarily for the subcutaneous drug delivery market as governed by the United States Food and
Drug Administration (the FDA quality and regulatory system and international regulations and standards for quality system
management. 

Our revenues derive from three business sources: (i)
domestic core (which consists of US and Canada), (ii) international core, and (iii) novel therapies. Our domestic core and international
core revenues consist of sales of our products for the delivery of subcutaneous drugs that are FDA cleared for use with the FREEDOM TM 
System, with the primary delivery for immunoglobulin to treat Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases PIDD and Chronic Inflammatory
Demyelinating Polyneuropathy CIDP ). Novel therapies revenues consist of product revenues from our infusion system (syringe
drivers, tubing and needles) for feasibility/clinical trials (pre-clinical studies, Phase I, Phase II, Phase III) of biopharmaceutical
companies in the drug development process as well as non-recurring engineering services revenues NRE received from biopharmaceutical
companies to ready or customize the FREEDOM TM System for clinical and commercial use. 

The Company ended the third quarter of 2024 with 8.2
million in net revenues, a 16.8 increase compared to 7.0 million in the same period last year. Revenues were driven by growth in our
core domestic and international business of 11.7 and 5.1 , respectively, and 275.6 in our novel therapies business. 

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 5.2
million, a 19.4 increase compared to 4.3 million in the same period last year, primarily driven by additional revenue from volume growth
in each of our core and novel therapies businesses. Gross margin was 63.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase
from 62.0 in the prior year period. We define gross margin as gross profit stated as a percentage of net revenues. 

Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were
 6.9 million, compared to 6.1 million for the same period last year, driven by an increase of 0.5 million in selling, general, and administrative
expenses and an increase of 0.2 million in research and development expenses.

Total net revenues increased 1.2 million, or 16.8 , to 8.2 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7 million in the same period in 2023. Domestic core revenues increased by 11.7 
to 6.4 million over the prior year period, primarily due to higher consumable and pump volumes driven by new patients starts and market
share gains. International core revenues increased by 5.1 to 1.1 million over the prior year period, primarily due to higher consumable
volumes driven largely by increased Ig supply, increased penetration within certain approved indications, and geographic expansion. Partially
offsetting the growth were lower orders from a distribution partner that expedited 0.3 million orders in the second quarter of 2024 related
to the BSI regulatory review which has since been successfully appealed. Novel therapies net revenues increased by 275.6 to 0.6 million
over the prior year period, primarily driven by clinical trial orders and progress on NRE milestones completed for multiple collaboration
agreements.

months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 62.0 in the prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven
by a favorable sales mix of clinical trial orders, an improved NRE mix of more profitable services, and increased average selling prices
when compared to the prior year period.

Depreciation and amortization expense remained flat
at 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.2 million during the same period in 2023, primarily
driven by timing of projects and related capital spending.

Total net revenues increased 3.5 million, or 16.3 to 24.8 million, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 21.3 million in the same period in 2023. Domestic core revenues increased by
9.9 to 18.6 million over the prior year period, primarily due to volume growth in consumables driven by new patients starts and share
gains. International core revenues increased by 38.4 to 4.5 million over the prior year period, primarily due to higher consumable and
pump volumes driven largely by increased Ig supply, increased penetration within certain approved indications, and geographic expansion.
Novel therapies net revenues increased by 46.3 to 1.7 million over the prior year period, driven by Phase III clinical trial orders
and milestone completion from our collaboration agreements in the current period. 

Gross Profit

Gross profit increased 3.4 million, or 27.4 to 15.8 million, for the

by the increase in net revenues of 3.5 million as described above and improvements in manufacturing efficiency. Gross margin increased
to 63.6 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 58.0 in the same prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily
driven by increased manufacturing efficiencies versus the prior year. Additionally, we realized improved NRE margin compared with the
prior year period driven by a more profitable mix of services performed.

 0.5 million, or 2.9 to 15.8 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 15.3 million in the same period
in 2023, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense. 

Research and development expenses decreased 0.3 million,
or 7.0 to 4.1 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.5 million in the same period in 2023, primarily
due to a 1.1 million decrease in consulting expense due to less outsourcing activities and timing of project spend, partially offset
by a 0.4 million increase in severance expense due to the elimination of the CTO role, and a 0.4 million increase in compensation and
benefits. 

Depreciation and amortization expense remained flat
at 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.6 million in the same period in 2023, resulting from minimal
purchases of new PP E being commissioned during the period.

Our net loss decreased 1.8 million in the nine months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, mostly driven by an increase in gross profit of 3.4 million, partially offset by an
increase in operating expense of 0.2 million and a prior year tax benefit of 1.4 million. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our principal source of liquidity is our cash on hand
of 8.8 million as of September 30, 2024. Our principal source of operating cash inflows is from sales of our products and NRE.
Our principal cash outflows relate to the purchase and production of inventory, funding of research and development, and selling, general
and administrative expenses. To develop new products, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality,
we are continuing to invest in research and development and manufacturing equipment. 

Our inventory position was 3.9 million at September
30, 2024, which reflects an increase of 0.4 million from December 31, 2023. 

We expect that our cash on hand and cash flows from
operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next twelve months. Continued execution on our longer-term
strategic plan may require the Company to draw on our credit facility, take on additional debt, raise capital through issuance of equity,
or a combination of both. Our future capital requirements may vary from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including
our rate of sales growth, the timing and extent of spending on various strategic initiatives including research and development, our international
expansion, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our solutions, and overall economic conditions including inflation
and the potential impact of global supply imbalances on the global financial markets. To the extent that current and anticipated future
sources of liquidity are or are expected to be insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required
to draw on our new credit facility or seek additional equity or debt financing sooner. There can be no assurance the Company will be able
to obtain the financing or raise the capital required to fund its operations or planned expansion.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 1.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.0 million in the same period in 2023. This net cash usage of 1.3 million was primarily due
to the net loss of 4.5 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 1.2 million, and increases in inventory of 0.4 million, partially
offset by increases in accounts payable and payroll bonus accruals of 1.9 million, and decreases in pre-paid expenses of 0.3 million.
Additional offsets to the net loss were non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of 1.9 million, and depreciation and
amortization expense of 0.7 million. 

Net cash used in operating activities was 6.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This net cash usage was primarily due to the net loss of 6.3 million, plus cash flows used
to reduce accrued expenses of 1.4 million, primarily from the payment of 2023 bonuses, and a decrease in accounts payable of 1.4 million,
offset by cash flows generated from a decrease in inventory of 1.7 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of 0.3 million. Further
contributing to this change were non-cash items including an increase in deferred tax assets of 1.5 million offset by stock-based compensation
expense of 2.4 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 0.6 million and a loss on disposal of fixed assets of 0.1 million. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities of 1.4 million
for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, was for capital expenditures for manufacturing equipment related to our new consumables
production lines. 

Net cash used in investing activities of 0.6 million
for the nine months ending September 30, 2023, was for capital expenditures for research and development and office equipment. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities of 0.03 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to payments on our note payable for insurance premium financing, partially offset
by new borrowings for a subsequent insurance premium financing agreement. 

Net cash used in financing activities of 0.04 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to payments on our note payable for insurance premium financing as well as for payments
on our finance leases.
