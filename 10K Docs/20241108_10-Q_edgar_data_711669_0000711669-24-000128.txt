 Management evaluates available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation to determine if credit-related impairment exists. Management first evaluates whether they intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell an impaired security

available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities that had unrealized losses. These securities are guaranteed by either the U.S. Government, other governments or U.S. corporations. In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition. The unrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. As management has the ability to hold debt securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable future if classified as available-for-sale, no declines are due to reasons of credit quality. 
 The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), as amended on January 1, 2023 which included evaluation of expected credit losses on debt securities. As part of the Company's calculated credit losses, the allowance for credit losses on investment securities was determined to be de minimis due to the high credit quality of the portfolio, which includes securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. treasury and U.S. government agencies and high quality municipalities. Therefore, allowance for credit losses was recorded as of September 30, 2024. See Note 1 for additional details on the allowance for credit losses as it relates to the securities portfolio.

 The Company elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of loans disclosed throughout this note. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable for loans totaled million for both periods and is included in the "Other assets" line item on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Commercial, financial agricultural loans are extended to a diverse group of businesses within the Company s market area. These loans are often underwritten based on the borrower s ability to service the debt from income from the business. Real estate construction loans often require loan funds to be advanced prior to completion of the project. Due to uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, changes in interest rates and other economic conditions, these loans often pose a higher risk than other types of loans. Consumer and other loans are originated at the Bank level. 
 Credit Quality Indicators. As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to (1) the risk grade assigned to commercial and consumer loans, (2) the level of classified commercial loans, (3) net charge-offs, (4) nonperforming loans, and (5) the general economic conditions in the Company s geographic markets. 
 The Company uses a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each of its loans. For commercial loans over , loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 10. A description of the general characteristics of the grades is as follows: 
 Grades 1, 2 and 3 - Loans with these assigned risk grades range from virtual absence of risk to minimal risk. Such loans may be secured by Company-issued and controlled certificates of deposit or properly margined equity securities or bonds. Other loans comprising these grades are made to companies that have been in existence for a long period of time with many years of consecutive profits and strong equity, good liquidity, excellent debt service ability and unblemished past performance, or to exceptionally strong individuals with collateral of unquestioned value that fully secures the loans. Loans in this category fall into the pass classification. 
 Grades 4 and 5 - Loans assigned these pass risk grades are made to borrowers with acceptable credit quality and risk. The risk ranges from loans with no significant weaknesses in repayment capacity and collateral protection to acceptable loans with one or more risk factors considered to be more than average. These loans are also included in the pass classification. 
 Grade 6 - This grade includes special mention loans on management s watch list and is intended to be used on a temporary basis for pass grade loans where risk-modifying action is intended in the short-term. 
 Grades 7 and 8 - These grades include substandard loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines. This category includes borrowers with well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the payment of the debt in accordance with the agreed terms. Loans considered to be impaired are assigned grade 8, and these loans often have assigned loss allocations as part of the allowance for credit losses. Generally, loans on which interest accrual has been stopped would be included in this grade range. 
 Grades 9 and 10 - These grades correspond to regulatory classification definitions of doubtful and loss, respectively. In practice, any loan with these grades would be for a very short period of time, and generally the Company has no loans with these assigned grades. Management manages the Company s problem loans in such a

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

and consumer loans, the Company began using behavioral based risk grades during the second quarter of 2024. These loans are assigned risk grades of 98 or 99 based on payment performance with the Company. 
 Grade 98 - Loans assigned this risk grade indicates a "pass" credit. 
 Grade 99 - Loans assigned this risk grade indicates a "substandard" credit and is moved to a nonaccrual status.

 A loan s risk grade is assigned at loan origination and is based on the financial strength of the borrower and the type of collateral. Loan risk grades are subject to review at various times throughout the year as part of the Company s ongoing loan review process. Loans with an assigned risk grade of 7, 8, 9, 10 or 99 and an outstanding balance of or more are reassessed on a quarterly basis. During this reassessment process individual reserves may be identified and placed against certain loans which are not considered impaired. 
 In assessing the overall economic condition of the markets in which it operates, the Company monitors the unemployment rates for its major service areas. The unemployment rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the allowance for credit loss determination. 
 Loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory guidelines. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. 
 Collateral-Dependent Loans 
 We classify a loan as collateral-dependent when our borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and we expect repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral. Our commercial loans have collateral that is comprised of real estate and business assets. Our consumer loans have collateral that is substantially comprised of residential real estate. The Company had million and million in collateral-dependent loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. 
 Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain of its real estate loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. 
 In some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan, or portion of a loan, has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan, or portion of the loan, is written off.

 Colony used a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The changes in loss rates used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses during this period were modeled using historical data from peer banks and macroeconomic forecast data obtained from a third party vendor, which were then applied to Colony's recent default experience as a starting point. As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects that the markets in which it operates will experience stable economic and unemployment conditions with the trend of delinquencies returning to more normalized levels, over the next two years. Management adjusted the historical loss experience for these expectations. No reversion adjustments were necessary, as the starting point for the Company's estimate was a cumulative loss rate covering the expected contractual term of the portfolio. 
 The Company determines its individual reserves during its quarterly review of substandard loans. This process involves reviewing all loans with a risk grade of 7, 8, 9, 10 or 99 and an outstanding balance of or more, regardless of the loans impairment classification. 
 The Company maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines of credit, commitments to extend future credit, as well as both standby and commercial letters of credit when there is a contractual obligation to extend credit and when this extension of credit is not unconditionally cancellable. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding study derived from internal information, and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments is separately classified on the balance sheet within other liabilities.

 interest rate swaps during the second quarter of 2023, to hedge the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") interest rate risk for its short-term funding over the term of these cash flow hedges. The Company entered into additional interest rate swaps during the third quarter of 2024, of which was designated as a cash flow hedge and the other a fair value hedge. Fair value hedging relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of an asset or liability.

Letters of credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. 
 Standby and performance letters of credit are conditional lending commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. Essentially all letters of credit issued have expiration dates within . The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. 
 Legal Contingencies . In the ordinary course of business, there are various legal proceedings pending against the Company and the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position.

 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on many judgments. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 Fair value estimates are based on existing on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments include deferred income taxes and premises and equipment. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

to account for selling and marketing costs. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Because of the high degree of judgment required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned assets and because of the relationship between fair value and general economic conditions, we consider the fair value of other real estate owned assets to be highly sensitive to changes in market conditions.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of Colony Bankcorp, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary, Colony Bank, from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024 and on our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K, and information presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 1. 
 Forward-looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, might, should, could, predict, potential, believe, expect, continue, will, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, strive, projection, goal, target, outlook, aim, would, annualized and outlook, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 A number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the following: 
 the impact of current and future economic and market conditions generally (including seasonality) and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our primary market areas, including the effects of inflationary pressures, changes in interest rates (including the impact of prolonged elevated interest rates on our financial projections and models), slowdowns in economic growth, and the potential for high unemployment rates, as well as the financial stress on borrowers and changes to customer and client behavior (including the velocity of loan repayment) and credit risk as a result of the foregoing 
 
 changes in interest rate environment (including changes to the federal funds rate, the level and composition of deposits (as well as the cost of, and competition for, deposits), loan demand, liquidity and the values of loan collateral, securities and market fluctuations, and interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities), and competition in our markets may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus reducing our margins and net interest income; 
 
 our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements, including our ability to generate liquidity internally or raise capital on favorable terms, including continued access to the debt and equity capital markets; 
 
 the risk that a future economic downturn and contraction, including a recession, could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including the risk that the strength of the current economic environment could be weakened by the impact of prolonged elevated interest rates and inflation; 
 factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including real estate values and liquidity in our primary market areas, the financial health and credit quality of our borrowers and the success of various projects that we finance; 
 concentration of our loan portfolio in real estate loans and changes in the prices, values and sales volumes of commercial and residential real estate; 
 weakness in the real estate market, which can affect, among other things, the value of collateral securing mortgage loans, mortgage loan originations and delinquencies, and mortgage fee income; 
 
 43 

credit and lending risks associated with our construction and development, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and residential real estate loan portfolios; 
 factors that negatively impact our mortgage banking services, including declines in our mortgage originations or profitability due to rising or elevated interest rates and increased competition and regulation, the Bank s or third party s failure to satisfy mortgage servicing obligations, loan modifications, the effects of judicial or regulatory requirements or guidance, and the possibility of the Bank being required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers; 
 
 our ability to attract sufficient loans that meet prudent credit standards, including in our construction and development, commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loan categories; 
 our ability to attract and maintain business banking relationships with well-qualified businesses, real estate developers and investors with proven track records in our market areas; 
 our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses ("ACL"); 
 the adequacy of our reserves (including ACL) and the appropriateness of our methodology for calculating such reserves; 
 adverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures and the impact of such developments on customer confidence, liquidity and regulatory responses to these developments (including increases in the cost of our deposit insurance assessments and increased regulatory scrutiny), our ability to effectively manage our liquidity risk and any growth plans and the availability of capital and funding; 
 our ability to successfully execute our business strategy to achieve profitable growth; 
 the concentration of our business within our geographic areas of operation in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and neighboring markets; 
 our focus on small and mid-sized businesses; 
 our ability to manage our growth; 
 our ability to increase our operating efficiency; 
 significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets and the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment securities; 
 risks that our cost of funding could increase, in the event we are unable to continue to attract stable, low-cost deposits and reduce our cost of deposits; 
 inability of our risk management framework to effectively mitigate credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk, compliance risk, operational risk (including by virtue of our relationships with third party business partners, as well as our relationships with third party vendors and other service providers), strategic risk, reputational risk and other risks inherent to the business of banking; 
 our ability to maintain expenses in line with current projections; 
 the makeup of our asset mix and investments; 
 external economic, political and/or market factors, such as changes in monetary and fiscal policies and laws (including as a result of the United States presidential election and, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve), the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations, inflation or deflation, changes in the demand for loans, and fluctuations in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition; 
 continued or increasing competition from other financial institutions (including fintech companies), credit unions, and non-bank financial services companies, many of which are subject to different regulations than we are; 

44 

challenges arising from unsuccessful attempts to expand into new geographic markets, products, or services; 
 restraints on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us, which could limit our liquidity; 
 increased capital requirements imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital is not available on favorable terms or at all; 
 a failure in the internal controls we have implemented to address the risks inherent to the business of banking; 
 inaccuracies in our assumptions about future events, which could result in material differences between our financial projections and actual financial performance; 
 changes in our management personnel or our inability to retain, motivate and hire qualified management personnel; 
 the dependence of our operating model on our ability to attract and retain experienced and talented bankers in each of our markets, which may be impacted as a result of labor shortages; 
 our ability to prevent, identify and address cyber-security risks (which may be exacerbated by the development of generative artificial intelligence), fraud and systems errors; 
 disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems, and the cost of defending against them and any reputational or other financial risks following such a cybersecurity incident; 
 our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and disruptions in service, security breaches, financial difficulties with or other adverse events affecting a third-party vendor or business relationship; 
 an inability to keep pace with the rate of technological advances due to a lack of resources to invest in new technologies; 
 fraudulent and negligent acts by our clients, employees or vendors and our ability to identify and address such acts; 
 risks related to potential acquisitions, including the risk that the regulatory environment may not be conducive to or may prohibit the consummation of future mergers and/or business combinations, may increase the length of time and amount of resources required to consummate such transactions, and may reduce the anticipated benefit; 
 the impact of any claims or legal actions to which we may be subject, including any effect on our reputation; 
 compliance with governmental and regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and others relating to banking, consumer protection, securities and tax matters, and our ability to maintain licenses required in connection with commercial mortgage origination, sale and servicing operations; 
 changes in the scope and cost of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance and other coverage; 
 changes in our accounting standards; 
 changes in tariffs and trade barriers; 
 changes in federal tax law or policy; 
 the institution and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings against us or to which we may become subject to; 
 the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes; 
 examinations by our regulatory authorities; 
 
 45 

the effects of war or other conflicts (including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine or the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas), acts of terrorism, acts of God, natural disasters, health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics, climate changes, or other catastrophic events that may affect general economic conditions; 
 risks related to environmental, social and governance ("ESG") strategies and initiatives, the scope and pace of which could alter the Company's reputation and shareholder, associate, customer and third-party affiliations; 
 a deterioration of the credit rating for U.S. long-term sovereign debt, actions that the U.S. government may take to avoid exceeding the debt ceiling, and uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling and the federal budget; and 
 other risks and factors identified in our 2023 Form 10-K, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024, and in any of the Company's other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website at www.sec.gov. 
 The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Because of these risks and other uncertainties, our actual future results, performance or achievement, or industry results, may be materially different from the results indicated by the forward looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results. You should not rely on any forward looking statements, which represent our beliefs, assumptions and estimates only as of the dates on which they were made, as predictions of future events. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. 

Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors affecting the Company s financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements, notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had total consolidated assets of 3.1 billion, total loans, net of 1.9 billion, total deposits of 2.5 billion, and stockholders equity of 276.1 million. The Company reported net income of 5.6 million, or 0.32 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 16.4 million, or 0.94 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net income of 5.8 million, or 0.33 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 16.1 million, or 0.92 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of the increase in interest expense that more than offset the increase in interest income due to higher interest rates period over period. The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of increased net interest income as detailed above along with increases in noninterest income from service charges on deposits, gains on sales of SBA loans and increases in our complementary lines of business which include mortgage, small business specialty lending, marine/RV lending, insurance and wealth and merchant services. 
 Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was 18.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 1.1 million. Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 56.1 million, compared to 59.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 3.9 million. Increases can be seen in income on interest earning assets which is more than offset by increases in expenses on interest bearing liabilities due to the significant rise in interest rates period over period. Income on interest earning assets increased 2.0 million to 34.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. Expense on interest bearing liabilities increased 3.1 million to 16.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. Income on interest earning assets increased 9.5 million to 101.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. Expense on interest bearing liabilities increased 13.3 million to 45.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. 
 Provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 750,000 and 2.4 million, which represents 996,000 and 2.8 million in provision for credit losses on loans and 246,000 and 362,000 in release of credit losses on unfunded commitments, respectively. This is compared to 1.0 million and 2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represents 1.0 million and 2.2 million in provision for credit losses on loans and 0 and 91,000 in release of credit losses on unfunded commitments, respectively. For the third quarter of 2024, there were 
 
 46 

net charge-offs of 139,000 compared to 698,000 for the same period in 2023. Net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024 were 1.5 million compared to 898,000 for the same period in 2023. Colony s allowance for credit losses on loans was 19.7 million, or 1.04 of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 18.4 million, or 0.98 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonperforming assets were 12.5 million and 10.7 million, or 0.41 and 0.35 of total assets, respectively. 
 Noninterest income of 10.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 represents an increase of 364,000, or 3.75 , from the third quarter of 2023. Noninterest income of 29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents an increase of 2.7 million, or 10.40 , compared to the same period of 2023. These increases were primarily related to increases in service charges on deposits, gain on sales of SBA loans and BOLI income which were partially offset by decreases in interchange fee income and losses on sales of securities. See "Table 3 - Noninterest income" for more detail and discussion on the primary drivers to the variances in noninterest income. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was 20.8 million, a decrease of 46,000, or 0.22 , from the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was 61.6 million, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 3.02 , from the same period in 2023. Decreases in noninterest expense were a result of decreases in occupancy and equipment expenses, communications expenses and deposit related expenses which were partially offset by an increase in advertising and public relation expenses. See "Table 4 - Noninterest expense" for more detail and discussion on the primary drivers to the decrease in noninterest expense. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. We have identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies, consisting of those related to business combinations, allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, we have identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on the Company s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Our financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, which are included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. Other than our methodology for estimating allowance for credit losses (mentioned below), there have been no significant changes to the Significant Accounting Policies as described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 A consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses. The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrower. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses ACL and the allowance for unfunded commitments. The standard replaced the incurred loss approach, which was used prior to our adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2023, with an expected loss approach known as the Current Expected Credit Losses CECL ). The CECL approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). It removes the incurred loss approach s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was incurred. 
 
 The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Finally, we consider forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable. The allowance for unfunded commitments represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit. This allowance is estimated by loan segment at each balance sheet date under the CECL model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur. 

47 

Management s evaluation of the appropriateness of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the credit risk rating we assign to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, reliance on historical loss rates on homogenous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors, and the reliance on our reasonable and supportable forecasts. The reserve for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment also includes an amount for inherent risks not reflected in the historical analyses. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, concentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower, and industry), local/regional economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, changes in collateral values, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the volume and terms of loans. 

Recent Industry Developments 
 
 During 2023, the banking industry experienced significant volatility with multiple high-profile bank failures which led to industry wide concerns related to liquidity, deposit outflows, uninsured deposit concentrations, unrealized securities losses and eroding consumer confidence in the banking system, which has begun to soften in 2024. These negative industry developments did not impact the Company s liquidity position and our balance sheet remains robust. The Company s total deposits did experience a minimal decline of 0.78 as compared to December 31, 2023, to 2.52 billion at September 30, 2024 which was due to wholesale deposit payoffs. The Company s uninsured deposits represented 31.64 of total Bank deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 30.22 of total Bank deposits at December 31, 2023. The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity with available sources of funding of approximately 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024. Furthermore, the Company s capital remains strong with common equity Tier 1 and total capital ratios of 12.51 and 16.48 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024. 

Results of Operations 
 We reported net income and diluted earnings per share of 5.6 million and 0.32, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to net income and diluted earnings per share of 5.8 million and 0.33, respectively, for the same period in 2023. We reported net income and diluted earnings per share of 16.4 million and 0.94, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024. This compares to net income and diluted earnings per share of 16.1 million and 0.92, respectively, for the same period in 2023.

Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds, is the single largest component of total revenue. Management strives to optimize this income while balancing interest rate, credit and liquidity risks. 
 The banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest income: net interest spread and net interest margin. The net interest spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate spread eliminates the effect of noninterest-bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements. The net interest margin is an indication of the profitability of a company's balance sheet and is defined as net interest income as a percent of average total interest-earning assets, which includes the positive effect of funding a portion of interest-earning assets with noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity. 
 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 18.7 million and 19.8 million, respectively. This decrease quarter over quarter can be seen in increases in rates paid on deposits and other borrowings which outpaced the increases in rates and volume on loans and deposits in banks. The net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 2.64 and 2.78 , respectively. This decrease in net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily a result of the increase in higher yields paid on deposits that outpaced the increase in rates on loans and deposits in banks. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 56.1 million and 59.9 million, respectively. This decrease quarter over quarter can be seen in increases in rates paid on deposits and other borrowings which outpaced the increases in rates and volume on loans and deposits in banks. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was 2.67 and 2.87 , respectively. This decrease in net interest margin is primarily a result of the increase in higher yields paid on deposits that outpaced the increase in rates on loans and deposits in banks. While we had anticipated margin expansion in the second half of the year, we did not see it materialize in the third quarter of 2024. However, we believe that the margin has now reached its lowest point and we are optimistic about seeing improvement going forward as changes in the rate environment and easing from the Federal Reserve will allow us to relieve pressure on our funding costs. 
 The following tables indicates the relationship between interest income and interest expense and the average amounts of assets and liabilities for the periods indicated. As shown in the tables, average assets decreased and average liabilities increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in average assets was primarily driven by the decrease in investment securities of 52.5 million, which was partially offset by an increase in deposits in banks of 10.3 million and the loan portfolio of 32.6 million. The increase in average liabilities was primarily attributed to an increase in borrowings of 25.2 million as well as an increase in interest bearing deposits of 8.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, both average assets and average liabilities increased compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in average assets was primarily driven by the increase in the loan portfolio and deposits in banks of 71.5 million and 6.4 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities of 59.3 million. The increase in average liabilities was funded through an increase in interest bearing deposits of 52.6 million along with a slight increase in borrowings of 1.8 million. The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will continue to be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the competitive environment. 
 The yield on total interest-bearing liabilities increased from 2.26 in the third quarter of 2023 to 2.76 in the third quarter of 2024. The yield on total interest-bearing liabilities increased from 1.94 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 2.66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily due to increases in the federal funds interest rate of an additional 100 basis points during the first nine months of 2023.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses recorded in each period is based on the amount required such that the total allowance for credit losses reflects the appropriate balance, in the estimation of management, sufficient to cover expected credit losses over the expected life of a loan exposure and unfunded commitments where the likelihood is that funding will occur. Provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 750,000 and 2.4 million, respectively, compared to 1.0 million and 2.1 million, respectively, for the same period in 2023. The provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes 996,000 and 2.8 million, respectively, in credit losses on loans and 246,000 and 362,000, respectively, in release of credit losses on unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes 1.0 million and 2.2 million, respectively, in credit losses on loans and 0 and 91,000, respectively, in release of credit losses on unfunded commitments. See the section captioned Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for credit losses.

Noninterest Income 
 The following table represents the major components of noninterest income for the periods indicated. Table 3 - Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Amount Percent 2024 2023 Amount Percent Service charges on deposits 2,401 2,200 201 9.1 7,062 6,140 922 15.0 Mortgage fee income 1,812 1,730 82 4.7 4,503 4,928 (425) (8.6) Gain on sales of SBA loans 2,227 1,268 959 75.6 6,620 3,429 3,191 93.1 Loss on sales of securities (454) (454) (100.0) (1,434) (1,434) (100.0) Interchange fees 2,163 2,202 (39) (1.8) 6,269 6,401 (132) (2.1) BOLI income 383 335 48 14.3 1,314 1,024 290 28.3 Insurance commissions 433 509 (76) (14.9) 1,318 1,421 (103) (7.2) Other noninterest income 1,117 1,474 (357) (24.2) 3,414 2,986 428 14.3 Total noninterest income 10,082 9,718 364 3.7 29,066 26,329 2,737 10.4 
 Noninterest income increased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases in both periods is a result of increases in service charges on deposits, gain on sales of SBA loans and BOLI income which were partially offset by decreases in interchange fee income and losses on sales of securities. 
 Service charges on deposits. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, service charges on deposits experienced increases compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023 . These increases in service charges on deposits can be attributed to the Company's ability to maintain a strong deposit base despite the challenging rate environment. 
 Mortgage Fee Income . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, mortgage fee income increased and decreased, respectively, as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The three month increase in mortgage fee income was the result of improved mortgage production during the third quarter of 2024. The nine month decrease in mortgage fee income was the result of decreases in mortgage production which can be partially attributed to the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged until the end of the third quarter of 2024. 
 Gain on sales of SBA loan s. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net realized gains on the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans increased as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases are related to increased production and sales in the Small Business Specialty Lending division which hit its highest mark in five consecutive quarters during the first quarter of 2024 and continues to perform at a high level. 
 BOLI income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, BOLI income was higher when compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases are primarily related to income from the payout of death benefits during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Interchange fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interchange fee income was slightly lower than the same periods ended September 30, 2023 . These minimal decreases in interchange fees are the result of customer use of our card programs whose buying habits can fluctuate between periods. 
 Insurance commissions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, insurance commissions decreased slightly compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023 . These variances are volume driven by activity in the Company's insurance division. 
 Other noninterest income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other noninterest income decreased and increased, respectively, as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other noninterest income for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decline in commissions received from our partnership with Innovation Refunds related to the Employee Retention Credit as well as recording a loss on the sale of assets in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a gain on the sale of assets in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other noninterest income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to increases in wealth advisory and merchant services, gains on sales of other real estate along with increases in SBA servicing and other related fee income, partially offset by a writedown of Bank premises in the second quarter of 2024.

Noninterest Expense 
 The following table represents the major components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated. 
 Table 4 - Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Amount Percent 2024 2023 Amount Percent Salaries and employee benefits 12,594 11,973 621 5.2 36,889 37,929 (1,040) (2.7) Occupancy and equipment 1,523 1,620 (97) (6.0) 4,505 4,740 (235) (5.0) Information technology expenses 2,150 2,064 86 4.2 6,487 6,406 81 1.3 Professional fees 748 752 (4) (0.5) 2,286 2,348 (62) (2.6) Advertising and public relations 965 766 199 26.0 2,892 2,432 460 18.9 Communications 210 224 (14) (6.3) 652 710 (58) (8.2) Other noninterest expense 2,645 3,482 (837) (24.0) 7,851 8,913 (1,062) (11.9) Total noninterest expense 20,835 20,881 (46) (0.2) 61,562 63,478 (1,916) (3.0) 
 Noninterest expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased and decreased, respectively, as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses for the three month comparison is a result of an increase in FAS91-deferred costs due to accelerated marine/RV lending costs and the increase in Upstart costs. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expenses for the nine month comparison is related to the Company's expense reduction initiative in 2023 which lowered total number of employees period over period. 
 Information technology expenses . Information technology expenses increased slightly for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases relate primarily to an increase in software expenses. 
 Professional fees . Professional fees decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These decreases are the result of decreased legal fees partially offset by increased audit and consulting fees. 
 Advertising and public relations . Advertising and public relations expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the three month period comparison is related to increased marketing and advertising expenses. The increase for the nine month period comparison can be attributed to a donation in the second quarter of 2024 to Colony Museum, an organization in Fitzgerald, Georgia that Colony Bank helped to establish along with increased marketing and advertising expenses.. 
 Communications . Communications expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The changes in each period are related to fluctuations in data circuit fees and postage and freight charges. 
 Other noninterest expense . Other noninterest expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These decreases relate primarily to decreases in deposit related costs, amortization of intangibles and printing and supplies expenses which are partially offset by increased loan related costs. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.4 million and 4.3 million, respectively, compared to 1.7 million and 4.0 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.0 and 20.6 , respectively, compared to 22.2 and 19.7 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The largest driver of the difference is the tax-exempt 
 
 54 

income primarily from BOLI and tax exempt interest. Also, in both the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, the Company experienced a favorable tax impact from the donation made to the Georgia Scholarship Program. 
 Balance Sheet Review 
 Total assets remained constant at 3.1 billion for both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 At September 30, 2024, gross loans outstanding (excluding loans held for sale) were 1.89 billion, an increase of 2.6 million, or 0.14 , compared to 1.88 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, approximately 64.1 of our loans were secured by commercial real estate. Our total commercial real estate loans have decreased slightly since December 31, 2023 as well as our residential real estate and commercial, financial agricultural loans while increases can be seen in consumer lending which is driven by our marine and RV division. These movements are largely due to the sale of portfolio mortgages and credit related payoffs of a limited number of loans, along with the general slowdown in loan production over the past several quarters. We continue to maintain competitive loan pricing and tightened credit standards. 
 The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Table 5 - Loans Outstanding (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024

 The Company's risk mitigation processes include an independent loan review designed to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio and to ensure credit grade accuracy. The analysis serves as a tool to assist management in assessing the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Loans classified as "substandard" are loans which are inadequately protected by the current credit worthiness and paying capacity of the borrower and/or the collateral pledged. These assets exhibit well-defined weaknesses or are showing signs there is a distinct possibility the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. These weaknesses may be characterized by past due performance, operating losses and/or questionable collateral values. Loans classified as "doubtful" are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but have an increased risk of loss. Loans classified as "loss" are those loans which are considered uncollectible and are in the process of being charged off. 
 The Company regularly monitors the composition of the loan portfolio as part of its evaluation over the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Company focuses on the following loan categories: (1) construction, land land development; (2) other commercial real estate; (3) residential real estate; (4) commercial, financial agricultural; and (5) consumer and other. 
 The allowance for credit losses for loans is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses for loans is based on management s evaluation of the size and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming and past due loans, historical trends of charged off loans and recoveries, prevailing economic conditions and other factors management deems appropriate. The Company s management has established an allowance for credit losses for loans which it believes is adequate to cover expected credit losses over the expected life of a loan exposure and unfunded commitments where the likelihood is that funding will occur. Based on a credit evaluation of the loan portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses for loans and allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments to the Company s Board of Directors, which primarily focuses on risk by evaluating individual loans in certain risk categories. These categories have also been established by management and take the form of loan grades. By grading the loan portfolio in this manner, the Company s management is able to effectively evaluate the 
 
 55 

portfolio by risk, which management believes is the most effective way to analyze the loan portfolio and thus analyze the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans. 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans is established by examining (1) the large classified loans, nonaccrual loans and loans considered impaired and evaluating them individually to determine the specific reserve allocation and (2) the remainder of the loan portfolio to allocate a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions for the particular loan category. The Company also considers other factors such as changes in lending policies and procedures; changes in national, regional and/or local economic and business conditions; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; changes in the experience, ability and depth of either the market president or lending staff; changes in the volume and severity of past due and classified loans; changes in the quality of the loan review system; and other factors management deems appropriate. 
 The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The ACL is calculated using the same aggregate reserve rates calculated for the funded portion of loans at the portfolio level applied to the amount of commitments expected to fund. 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans was 19.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 17.4 million at September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.3 million, or 13.2 . The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of loans was 1.04 and 0.93 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses was 750,000 compared to 1,000,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 includes 996,000 in credit losses on loans and a release of 246,000 in credit losses on unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 includes 1.0 million in credit losses on loans and a release of 0 in credit losses on unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses was 2.4 million compared to 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes 2.8 million in credit losses on loans and a release of 362,000 in credit losses on unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes 2.2 million in credit losses on loans and a release of 91,000 in credit losses on unfunded commitments. The amount of provision expense recorded in each period was the amount required such that the total allowance for credit losses reflected the appropriate balance, in the estimation of management, that was sufficient to cover expected credit losses on loans over the expected life of a loan exposure and unfunded commitments where the likelihood is that funding will occur. 
 Additional information about the Company s allowance for credit losses is provided in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Nonperforming Assets 
 Asset quality experienced a slight decline during the first nine months of 2024. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more, repossessed personal property and other real estate owned ("OREO"). Nonaccrual loans totaled 12.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.4 million, or 24.1 , from 9.8 million at December 31, 2023. There was one loan contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaling 44,000 at September 30, 2024 and one loan totaling 370,000 at December 31, 2023. There was 9,000 in repossessed personal property at September 30, 2024 and none at September 30, 2023. OREO totaled 227,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to 448,000 at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, total nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets increased to 0.41 compared with 0.35 at December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily the result of one commercial, financial agriculture loan of 1.1 million and one other commercial real estate relationship of 2.0 million along with several SBSL government guaranteed loans in various call codes partially offset by repayments, payoffs and charged off loans. 
 Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory requirements. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for non-accrual status whether or not the loan is 90 days or more past due. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent loan payments made on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest. 
 Foreclosed property is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. If the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, at the time of foreclosure is less than the loan balance, the deficiency is charged against the allowance for credit losses on loans. If the lesser of the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, or the listed selling price, less the costs to sell, of the foreclosed property decreases during the holding period, a valuation allowance is established with a charge to foreclosed property expense. When the foreclosed property is sold, a gain or loss is recognized on the sale for the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property. 
 Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: Table 8 - Nonperforming Assets (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Nonaccrual loans 12,215 9,839 Loans past due 90 days and accruing 44 370 Other real estate owned 227 448 Repossessed assets 9 Total nonperforming assets 12,495 10,657 Nonaccrual loans by loan segment Construction, land land development 85 Commercial real estate 5,380 4,219 Residential real estate 1,486 3,561 Commercial, financial agricultural 5,327 1,956 Consumer other 22 18 Total nonaccrual loans 12,215 9,839 NPAs as a percentage of total loans and OREO 0.66 0.57 NPAs as a percentages of total assets 0.41 0.35 Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans 0.65 0.52 
 The Company had ten loans modified due to financial difficulty during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. See Note 3 - Loans, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on loan modifications.

Deposits 
 Deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: Table 9 - Deposits (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Noninterest-bearing deposits 439,892 498,992 Interest-bearing deposits 769,123 759,299 Savings 684,371 660,311 Time, 250,000 and over 198,942 167,680 Other time 432,642 458,508 Total deposits 2,524,970 2,544,790 
 Total deposits decreased 19.8 million to 2.52 billion at September 30, 2024 from 2.54 billion at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 17.4 of total deposits were comprised of noninterest-bearing accounts and 82.6 were comprised of interest-bearing deposit accounts, compared to 19.6 and 80.4 as of December 31, 2023, respectively. The overall decrease in our deposits was primarily the result of a decrease in brokered deposits due to the Company's proactive management of our balance sheet position. In addition, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased due to customer cash flow needs along with movement from noninterest-bearing products to interest-bearing products due to interest rates remaining at a higher level longer than had been expected. 
 We had 71.0 million and 93.6 million in brokered deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We use brokered deposits, subject to certain limitations and requirements, as a source of funding to support our asset growth and augment the deposits generated from our branch network, which are our principal source of funding. Our level of brokered deposits varies from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors, and tends to increase as a percentage of total deposits when the brokered deposits are less costly than issuing internet certificates of deposit or borrowing from the FHLB. 
 The Company's estimated uninsured deposits were 809.2 million at September 30, 2024, or 31.64 of total Bank deposits compared to 777.8 million at December 31, 2023, or 30.22 of total Bank deposits. Adjusted uninsured deposit estimate (which excludes deposits collateralized by public funds and internal accounts) were 463.0 million at September 30, 2024, or 18.11 of total Bank deposits compared to 453.1 million at December 31, 2023, or 17.60 of total Bank deposits. Adjusted uninsured deposits represent a small percentage of our overall deposits, which increases the stability of our deposit base and lowers our overall funding risk. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company is a party to credit related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 The Company s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. The type of collateral held varies, but may include cash or cash equivalents, unimproved or improved real estate, personal property or other acceptable collateral. 
 See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, for a table setting forth the financial instruments that were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk and more information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 59 

Liquidity 
 An important part of the Bank's liquidity resides in the asset portion of the balance sheet, which provides liquidity primarily through loan interest and principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities, as well as the ability to use these assets as collateral for borrowings on a secured basis. 
 The Bank's main source of liquidity is customer interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit accounts. Liquidity is also available from wholesale funding sources consisting primarily of federal funds purchased, FHLB advances and brokered deposits. These sources of liquidity are generally short-term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short-term liquidity needs. 
 To plan for contingent sources of funding not satisfied by both local and out-of-market deposit balances, the Company and the Bank have established multiple borrowing sources to augment their funds management. The Company has borrowing capacity through membership of the FHLB program. The Bank has also established overnight borrowing for federal funds purchased through various correspondent banks. There were no outstanding balances of federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 144.9 million and 83.3 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents have increased since year end 2023, primarily due to sales and paydowns of AFS investment securities. Management believes the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet the Company s liquidity needs without any material adverse impact on our operating results. 
 Liquidity management involves the matching of cash flow requirements of customers and the ability of the Company to manage those requirements. These requirements of customers include, but are not limited to, deposits being withdrawn or providing assurance to borrowers that sufficient funds are available to meet their credit needs. We strive to maintain an adequate liquidity position by managing the balances and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities so that the balance we have in short-term assets at any given time will adequately cover any reasonably anticipated need for funds. Additionally, we maintain relationships with correspondent banks, which could provide funds on short notice, if needed. We have also invested in FHLB stock for the purpose of establishing credit lines with the FHLB. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 185.0 million and 175.0 million, respectively, of outstanding advances from the FHLB. Based on the values of loans pledged as collateral, we had 564.3 million and 596.2 million of additional borrowing availability with the FHLB at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Other sources of liquidity include overnight borrowings from the Federal Reserve Discount Window of 118.8 million of which there was no outstanding balance at September 30, 2024. The Company also had unencumbered securities of 435.1 million, 117.1 million in FRB Reserves and 26.3 million in other cash and due from banks as of September 30, 2024. Unencumbered investment securities provide the ability to either be pledged as collateral with borrowing sources or sold and converted to cash. 
 The Company is a separate entity from the Bank, and as such it must provide for its own liquidity. The Company is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its common shareholders and payment of interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities. These obligations are met through internal capital resources such as service fees and dividends from the Bank, which are limited by applicable laws and regulations. 

Capital Resources 
 The Company and the Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy. 
 The table below summarizes the capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank in order to be considered well-capitalized from a regulatory perspective, as well as the Company's and the Bank s capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered to be well-capitalized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There have been no conditions or events since

September 30, 2024 that management believes would change this classification. Table 10 - Capital Ratio Requirements Minimum Requirement Well-capitalized Risk-based ratios: Common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) 4.5 6.5 Tier 1 capital 6.0 8.0 Total capital 8.0 10.0 Leverage ratio 4.0 5.0

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company's primary market risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk, and to a lesser degree, liquidity risk. The Bank operates under an Asset Liability Management Policy which is approved by the Asset/Liability Management Committee, which is a Board committee that meets regularly. The policy outlines limits on interest rate risk in terms of changes in net interest income and changes in the net market values of assets and liabilities over certain changes in interest rate environments. These measurements are made through a simulation model which projects the impact of changes in interest rates on the Bank's assets and liabilities. The policy also outlines responsibility for monitoring interest rate risk and the process for the approval, implementation and monitoring of interest rate risk strategies to achieve the Bank's interest rate risk objectives. 
 The following table presents our interest sensitivity position at the dates indicated. Table 12 - Interest Sensitivity Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income from Base Scenario at September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Changes in rates 200 basis point increase 4.87 0.97 100 basis point increase 2.56 0.54 100 basis point decrease (2.28) 2.03 200 basis point decrease (4.96) 2.24
